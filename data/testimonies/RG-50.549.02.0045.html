<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">When we came, we have to start to build the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , because was just the electric wiring all around half. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We haven’t got no water, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was like a lot of malaria, a lot of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- a lot of sickness, because was -- they make the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , so we hardly could work, it was still [indecipherable], the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And I was there til 1945, in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> very close to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , just a couple steps away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Did you -- did you have much of a sense of how the war was going, that things had turned against the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No, we didn’t know nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">If they find a pencil, or a piece of paper on somebody, right away they hang the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So, we didn’t know nothing wi -- but we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> running above, but we didn’t know nothing of what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That -- that’s the way it was, until we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we realized that the war was coming to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It’s going to take -- but every day, people were dying anyway, from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Every minute, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  What was it that -- that made you realize the war was ending soon? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">What did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  What did we see? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Because the German starts to go away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and come closer to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , over there, in the other camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> anyway, to run anyway, because all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was fu -- filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So we was tha -- we didn’t even know when the war finished, because I tell you how we find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Near us was [indecipherable] from pilots, where the Germans shot down. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">French pilot, English pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We didn’t speak English, but they cut the wires, and they told us we are free, because the German ran away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they locked up, and we didn’t know the war was over, either, but we understood what’s happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They went out, and we went out, and we started to run to the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was empty, not with food, with people, because they were sure when we came out 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they going to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So they just -- they left all the -- in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was empty <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , th-the Germans run away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  What -- when -- when they cut the wires --

<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Not in this -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was electric wires, not over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They told us that we start to run for food, that’s the first thing, whatever we saw, sugar on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , any -- anything what we could eat, we started to eat, because for six years we were starving to death, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  But at the -- at the moment that that happened, and you realized --
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We --
QUESTION:  -- the war’s over, we’re free, do you remember -- did -- anything people said to each other, or how did -- do you remember your own emotions at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Yes, we -- we was -- we was happy the war -- the war was an end, but we wasn’t happy, we lost everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But we didn’t know what to do, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It -- 1t wasn’t organized, nothing was organized, we just was running from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the other, and we wouldn’t know what we going to do, where we going to end up. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It wasn’t yet order -- we made a mistake, we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We couldn’t go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> later. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So a lot of people who stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they organized them, and they got help. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We didn’t have any help in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I came back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and I went up to the government to ask for help, we were 10 girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So he gave us the key from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where we was finishing <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> belonged to a Jewish family, but they -- they got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So I told them, “How about food?” </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He said, “Nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Just stay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So we were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and we were starving, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We didn’t have what to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So, after a couple weeks, some people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and he told us that we shouldn’t stay there, because they already killed four girls that went in -- in a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The Armia kryova went in, they killed them, and one was hiding under the bedsheet in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they tried to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So the -- the life was very danger in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So he says, “Don’t stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you’re going to be caught -- killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You better come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , to a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> there, they’ll take you in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So we were happy to have [indecipherable] had, and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">You could only stay six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We have to smuggle ourselves to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So I -- I knew I had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I was already in contact with him, so I didn’t want to go, I want to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So they send me to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , to stay another six month. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We stood there a couple months, in this -- and these, the Polish people was very angry, they didn’t want the Jews back. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So one night they came in, the police, and they give us ammunition, they going to attack us, going to be a pogrom, you have to defend yourself, we can do nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So five people went to [indecipherable] on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We tried to pull out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Four of them got killed, they took them down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , 18 - 19 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">What -- Hitler let them live, but the Polish wouldn’t let them live. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">One was hiding under a pleated skirt by a lady in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So he crawled back, and he told us to pick up the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So, when I saw that, in time my brother came in, so I pick up my brother, and I says, “I’m not staying here. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I’m going to [indecipherable] right here the Bricha taking out the people,” because they says it’s a <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .. When we went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and we saw dead people, dead Jews, they wasn’t missed by nobody, their families was killed a couple years ago in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and they came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So they got killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So I took my brother, and I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and a Polish woman says to me, “You know, they took down yesterday, Jews, and they killed them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Like she gave me the idea that I’m going to be killed too, in a couple hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So I almost fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Finally, we reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vulsa</span> -- we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vulsa</span> , I fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I couldn’t take it any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So I find out that the Bricha organized people -- actually, they organized people who came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112"><span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> let in a half a million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So the older people -- so I got together with them, and we start to go -- the Jewish agency made up with American government that Czechoslovaki should let us in, out from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was like a couple thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was the only one with a number, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">In <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> we stood overnight, and we have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and they prepare camps for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We came to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , a few thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The people who should provide us with bread, sold the flour, and we didn’t have nothing to eat, we have to run in the <span class="DLF">field</span> to dig out a potato -- a pickle, to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That was after the war, in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In time, I met my husband, because he had a couple brothers in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So he told the Russian people coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , maybe one of his brothers will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">None of them survived, they all got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I met my husband, so he says to me, “How comes a number’? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It’s mostly people with the Russian.” </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So I told him I was waiting for my brother, he’Il -- til he came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and together I decided to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We have our chance, the Bricha -- thanks to the Bricha. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So my husband told me that he got papers to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in a month, a cousin sent him papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But if I marry, two people can go on the same certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I didn’t even know my husband, to be honest with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I decided, what do I got to leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="132"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is closed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , you couldn’t go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> anyway, we have to smuggle ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The people who went there, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I didn’t have where to go, I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My husband, when he was liberated, he didn’t live this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> gave him -- put him in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and they gave him three meals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So when I came in, I see this [indecipherable] <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , with white tablecloth, and eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I couldn’t believe it, that’s a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So I decided I got married, only the condition my brother should stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So that’s what’s happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">From that month, turn into two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They didn’t let into the <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> , they’re going to elect a president, it took two year. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So, a very hard time in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We couldn’t work, we have to live on a ration, [indecipherable] gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">A herring, a piece of bread, and that’s how we lived for two year. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Finally, we find out, in order to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , we have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was occupied by the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So we got ourselves on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we start to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The Russian soldier came out, and he says, “No, you can’t go there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So he took us down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So we was waiting for another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Now, we have to go out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , with our paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Rush -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was occupied by the Russian, so we couldn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So we were standing, they tore us down from the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and they told us, “You got to live here, you got to vote here, and die here. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You can never go out from here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We were like 10 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, we standing at night, and thinking what we going to do, til a -- a German guy, a young guy came over to us, and he says to us, like that, “You know, my father takes people over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">If you want to go, you give me a few dollars, til -- Pll take you, show how to go over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="159">If I see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> during the day, I wouldn’t climb up. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So we took -- I said, ““What’s going to be if he catch you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="161">The Russian is out - downstairs, you could see they working with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He says, “Well, I tell him my cow got lost, and I went to look for the cow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He got us over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , we stay overnight, but how we got down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , the very high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , I figured maybe I lay down [indecipherable] they had a hard time to get down. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We came down, finally, from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , we didn’t carry anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We came down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , we already on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you can’t go in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> at night, everything is closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And it’s raining, we don’t have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">While we was walking, I walk over -- a man was walking with a lady, and I says to him, “What -- we just came from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and it’s raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Where can we go?” </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So he says to us, “Come on, I'll take you to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , maybe they’ll let you in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So we thank him, we came in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and the guy said, “I’m sorry, no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I says to him, “Listen, I don’t care what you see, I’m going to sit here in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> , I’m not going out in the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">No way I’m going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We don’t -- we just came in, and we have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So he gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Once we got there, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we have to wait like five weeks til we
