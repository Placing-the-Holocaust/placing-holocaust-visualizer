ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Tell me about your experiences at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and with respect to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> or Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  We belonged to a congregation called Adas Israel, and we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> every Saturday morning, and of course we kept the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I knew that my mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budingen</span> , and from parents who were not in the least religious, and in fact my grandfather, who moved in with us in 1936 when things started getting difficult for Jews in small areas in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he always said I fought for the Kaiser and I'm German and I'm going tol've been born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I'm going to die in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of course, he didn't he died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , but he moved in with us in '36 and so did my uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Did your grandfather object to the degree observance in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as compared to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  No, he didn't object, and I think he and my uncle, his son, who moved in with us at the same time would go out and eat ham and pork, which we didn't have in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was a little difficult having them come and live with us in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but they had nowhere else to go because they're <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And then they started helping my father in his four <span class="BUILDING">leather shops</span> , and that was a great help having family to run these different <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">It was not a <span class="BUILDING">leather shop</span> in the way you think of it in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was a (?</span><span class="sentence" id="10">shumahe bedafsaticel?) </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And that is to say things that a shoe maker would buy to repair his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And it was a growing concern and it was called Rishad Brant, and in very, very small letters under Rishad Brant would be written Israel Nusboum, owner, so that people would notice it was a Jewish name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  You observed the holidays at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Yes, we observed the holidays, and I remember one of my favorite ones was Sukkot, and we walked through the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and there was one man who was a butcher who always gave us sausages for our collection, and that was a particularly grand day, and we really enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">But he fasted on Yom Kippur, and that was very important, and my brother was Bar Mitzvah in 1938, but by that time we had all thought of emigrating already because things were getting worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And we children were told never to hit back anybody who would call us Jew on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or who would attack us. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And this was sort of intimidating for a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We were not allowed to go to the movies, but we had a cleaning woman, a Christian cleaning woman who, very sweetly, would take us with her daughter to see some Shirley Temple films; so that was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Otherwise my parents played cards, and my mother helped also in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , and I remember a very happy childhood with cousins visiting, and I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was better to live in as a Jew than than small places in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I do remember one experience where we went towe went to a big fest, Unter Den Linden, and Hitler and his cohorts came by on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they were policemen on horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We thought, well, we ought see this man who's making such a difference in our lives, and low and behold, one of the horses kicked my mother, and the police were very solicitous and wanted to know our names so that they could, I guess, give us some sort of help, and we were very anxious not to tell them that our name was Nusboum, and my mother looked just like a Christian woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">She had blue eyes and blond hair so I guess they didn't realize they we were Jewish, but I remember we didn't tell our name or anything we said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It's perfectly all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Don't worry about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I do remember that it was sort of scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  That's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Tell me, what was your first experience of Nazi rise to power? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I know you were a child, but what can you recollect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  I remember our family talking about it and that we were scared, but we always thought it would pass, that the Germans would realize that Hitler really was no good, and that things would be well again. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Somehow one never anticipated the degree to which this (?</span><span class="sentence" id="31">youden fufulgen?) </span><span class="sentence" id="32">would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So that we did think of going other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seas</span> and made preparations for it to go illegally because we didn't have anyone to sponsor us. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But somehow we always relented at the last minute and decided to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was really only Kristallnacht that repelled us to think serously of leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  What was your experience of Kristallnacht or what did you hear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Well, it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We had a sudden telephone call from my l6yearold cousin who was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and she told us that "Uncle Iz" as she called himmy father whose name was <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Should go for a walk, and of course we immediately realized that somehow he shouldn't be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so he went over and stayed with his sister because we knew the Gestapo didn't look in <span class="BUILDING">women's houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They only looked in families. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They didn't look at <span class="BUILDING">women's houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">My uncle went to his girlfriend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My grandfather stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because he was 72 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And my brother of course was only 12; so we didn't think that that was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We had a visit from our janitor's wife who asked us whether father was in, and we said no he wasn't, and I don't really know why she visited whether she visited with a view to telling him to go out or whether the Gestapo had sent her on an advance to make sure that he was there, but in any event we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He was gone, and about ten minutes later two black leather coated men came up and asked for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We said he had gone out, and they very politely asked to look through the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to make sure; and we said, "Sure go right ahead." </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And of course he was gone, and they saw my grandfather sleeping there and asked how old he was, and we told him 72, and after they left, I remember my mother saying she was shaking all over, poor thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And of course us children we didn't realize the import of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But 1t was from that day onward that we did think of getting out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What steps did you take to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  It's so happened that at our <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , there were some forms being passed around where a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> had gotten together with a parentteacher association, and they had decided to bring to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> three children: One from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , one from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and one from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in fact three girls because it was a <span class="BUILDING">girl's school</span> , and since my parents said, well really should try to get out, I completed the form, and it was sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I was very lucky to be chosen the German girl to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So in May 21--I shan't never forget it of course--we went to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and off I went with the children's transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It was a dreadful experience because there was a Polish woman on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> who was being dragged away by Gestapo men by her hair, and she was screaming, and we didn't really know whether we'd all by arrested before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So it was very awful in leaving my parents really not with a view that I wouldn't see them again because I never thought that would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But it's a new experience to go a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with another language, and I remember I had a little gold ring and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">train compartment</span> , somebody mentioned that, "oh, we shouldn't have any jewelry with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I remember going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and hiding this little gold ring, and after we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I picked it up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I think it was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span> , something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But 1t was--we were very happy when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was like we could suddenly breathe freely, and there was some people in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> that brought us cookies and crackers and welcomed us with juices. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And it was like being in another world, and it's very odd, but after I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I started growing and getting bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I used to be a really thin little thing, and I guess being in a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> makes you think and eat differently, and I became a normal |3yearold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Tell me, you say your parents were planing to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Had they made any attempts to emigrate as a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Only illegal attempts. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My father was very scared that at the last minute at the <span class="DLF">border</span> we would be caught, and of course that would be worse than not going out at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So when I left, one of the things my parents had tried to get us out, which I did tried to do and I did manage to get my twin brother out, but unfortunately the war broke out, and I could not get my parents out, and they perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  On Kristallnacht, when your father was fortunate enough to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , do you know of any other men who were not so well prepared, and what happened to those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember about six weeks after Kristallnacht, my father's brother who was a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dortmund</span> came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and he had frostbitten fingers and toes, and he looked absolutely dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And then my English teacher came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and his teeth, his front teeth, had been smashed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And it was a very dreadful experience for us because as children you grow up trusting, trusting your parents, trusting the system, and all of a sudden you realize that you're on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> looking in, and things won't get better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  These men came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Well, as far as I can remember, I guess the Germans were not ready yet to keep men on a permanent basis; so that they let them go after about six weeks, and then they fined all Jews for the murder of Vom Rath, and we all had to give up part of our silver and pay money to compensate the Germans for having lost Vom Rath which was the excuse, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And eventually, of course, they did get <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ready, but at that time they didn't have sufficient facilities to keep people. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I think they would have been very happy to let all the Jews go out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because but of course they weren't allowed to take their money with them anyway, so they would have kept the money and got rid of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  They would have been happy to get the Jews go, but the Jews weren't ready to go then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I think the Jews were ready to go, but they didn't want to go without any money, which is what they would have had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">My father lost his four <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They were all broken into, and things were stolen, and after that he didn't have any work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So it was living on your income, whatever you had, but not making any more money. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So it was a matter of really thinking we have to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But it was easier said than done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  What was your experience as a Jew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">non Jewish community</span> before Hitler and then after Hitler came aboutcame to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Was there any change in the attitude of your friends and neighbors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  We really didn't have Christian friends because of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we went to with the other little girl was Jewish also, and just like in any big society in an apartment life, you don't really have neighbors with whom you associate. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So I can really say because we were all in Jewish circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Was there any change among the people that you weren't necessarily friendly with, but neighbors? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Did you discern increased hostility?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We lived our lives completely apart, but we were very careful not to give any neighbors cause to criticize us. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I remember very clearly listening to the BBC and foreign broadcasts, and our parents always while they were listening, had us gomy brother went to one <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I went to the other to make sure the noise wasn't penetrating the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> so thatbecause you could get arrested for listening to foreign news services.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  On your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and toward <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , tell me how were you provided for? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Did you take food along with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  I don't really remember whether we took food along, but we did get fed when we crossed the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> , and we were also fed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> before we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I shall never forget that because we had white bread, which I had never seen before and cornflakes, which was another thing that was new in my life, not having eaten cereals in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And then by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to a hallI guess it must have been in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and names were called of children, and various people picked them up and when my name came, there was a young blonde girl by name of Yolanda who came and picked me up, and she explained to me that she was the ward of the head mistress of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who had really been very much ahead of her timesingle woman who had adopted a German, a Czech, and an Austrian child. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And the German teacher had paid for my school education, which I didn't find out until the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Anyway, I'm proceeding myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of a Norman and Elsie Denim where I was to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They had a daughter about my age who went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and a son four years older, and Yolanda spoke a little bit of German to me, and this was when she got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she said, "Well, that's the last time I'll be speaking German with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I was sort of scared because I didn't speak very much English. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But everybody was very welcoming. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I do remember that we had tea, and everybody sat around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , all these new people chattering in English, and there was something that looked like chocolate paste, and I asked the young boy by name of Hue what it was, and he spoke a little German so he explained to me that it was chocolate the (?</span><span class="sentence" id="107">retch?) </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It turned out to be Marmite and very spicy, and I learned very soon to take very little of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And then I went upstairs and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and cried, and after that I guess I decided this was my new life, and I was going to have to accommodate to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And people were very, very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I'm still in touch with Marry, my foster sister, and Hue, my foster brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We visit each other's <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and we've been very close friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Were you able to contact your parents during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  I wrote to my parents on a regular basis, and they answered, and Auntie Elsie took me to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish language school</span> every Sunday, which was a big sacrifice for her because they were very devout Plymouth Brethren Christians, and so she missed the Sunday morning service taking me to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew class</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  What were you permitted to bring on your trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> when you left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Well, I remember I was allowed to carry one suitcase, which of course we each had to carry ourselves, and I remember my mother buying me some nice clothing to take along, all of which turned out to be completely unsuitable because we wore uniforms to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And as soon as I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , friends of Marry's would contribute school uniforms for me to wear, and as I said, I grew too quickly after that that in no time flat I had out gown all my beautiful clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I remember that when I was evacuated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> after the war had started, Auntie Elsie sold my clothes, and all I got from these beautiful garmentswhich actually I think I never wore againwere three pairs of black woollen stockings which I detested but which were part of our school uniform and I had to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I guess I've always remembered it because I was so unhappy about losing all these beautiful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But makes sense; they didn't fit me anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  How did you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You were from obviously from a welltodo family, and suddenly you're taking handmedowns from other families. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You were an impoverished child. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">How did that affect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Well, it didn't bother me too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Everybody was so kind, and it bothered me a little bit about the clothes as I said, but generally speaking, I was feeling so liberated and wonderful to be out of this scary atmosphere where you couldn't say what you thought, and all of a sudden I could say whatever I felt like, and when I saw a policeman and I cringed, Auntie Elsie would say, "You don't have to be afraid of ‘our Bobbies'," which they were called in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="128">They will always be there to help you." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And it was such a wonderful feeling to be free, really free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  How did you feel about being Jewish in an essentially Christian community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  I didn't worry about it at all because everybody was so very kind to me that I just felt I was one of the people, and nobody ever asked me was I Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Nobody treated me differently because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And as children will, they take for granted that whatever happens to them is the right thing, so I had no worry about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Tell me more please about your experience in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Sunday school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Well, we walked across the common every Sunday morning, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew class</span> , and having been told by my parents that I really should try and get our family out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I approached the head rabbi who was teaching us one Sunday morning and asked him if they could not find a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And he looked at me and he said, "Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You're the little girl who lives with nonJewish people." </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I said, "Yes, I am." </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he said, "Well, until you move to a Jewish family, there's nothing we can do." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So I said to him, "But if I move to a Jewish family, I'm already taking away the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that my brother could take." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And he said, "No, no there's nothing we can do until you move to a Jewish family." </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I left <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> very depressed and very unhappy and started crying on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and Auntie Elsie said to me, "What's the matter? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Why are you crying?" </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I told her about the incident, and it was Auntie Elsie and Uncle Norman who decided to adopt my brother who then came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at the beginning of August 1939 and started to process papers for my parents to come over, but unfortunately due to the war breaking out in September, they never made tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  How did you feel telling Auntie Elsie what the rabbi had said to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  I was very ashamed that a Jewish person would do a thing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I'm still ashamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  How did that effect your feelings towards Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, that's an interesting question because inat the outbreak of war, we werethe children that is to sayall of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were all evacuated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> , a small, very old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And there was no Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My Uncle Norman wrote to my father through the Red Cross asking whether it would be all right for Hans, my brother, and myself to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and my father wrote back and said that his children were old enough to know what was right, and that if he felt that since there was no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> of worship, we should go to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday schoolthat</span> he should feel very free to send us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Did Uncle Norman want to convert you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Which is why theyUncle Norman was a customs official in the British Civil Service, but he was interested in religion and had studied religion theology, and in fact he was a doctor of theology which he never, never talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But that was why he was interested in Jews and Judaism because, of course, he understood the connection between the Old and the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  What was Auntie Elsie's attitude toward you as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Auntie Elsie treated me not as a Jew, but as another child in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She endeared herself to me because I had brought a doll to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and during the transport its eyes had fallen out, and she took me to a <span class="BUILDING">doll hospital</span> and had the eyes put back in. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And the doll meant very much to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was the only cuddly thing, and the family was not a cuddly family so that all of a sudden physical contact was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I guess as Jews or Germans, perhaps we were more physically effusive certainly my family was with hugging each other which the Denim family never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Did your brother fit into the family there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Well, he fitted in very well because he had Hue as a companion, and of course, he was only there for about three weeks because at the beginning of September, we were evacuated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  How did you adapt to the new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> especially in a language you didn't understand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  It was difficult the first two or three days, but being thrown into an Englishspeaking household and going to an Englishspeaking school, I ended up just like Yolanda. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">In no time flat I wasn't speaking German anymore, only English, and I'm a little bit ashamed of myself because when I picked up my brother at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , I imitated Yolanda when we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said, "That's the last time I've spoken any German to you, Hans."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  As I remember you were very angry when Yolanda did that to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I'm afraid so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Was how long was it between the time you arrived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and Hans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  It was about two months, and I remember that it was difficult at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I was placed into a lower class so that I had less difficulty catching up, and the children were very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Occasionally they would tease me, and I remember one of them calling me fish face. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I asked Uncle Norman, "What's fish face?" </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And he said, "Well, it's nothing very bad, but next time you see the girl who said this to you, you just call her dog's body."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  What subjects were your favorite in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  I would say English was my favorite, and geography I loved, and art. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I loved drawing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  And the sciences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Well, I was never too good at the sciences I'm afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  How about your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  My brother's strength was mathematics, but of course, since he came in August, he never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">He started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> after we were evacuated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  How did you find the level of education in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> compared to what you had experienced in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  I would say it was about on the same level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Same amount of homework and number of hours in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I would say it was very _+ yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I would say it was very comparable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  Tell me about your experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichesteryour</span> home life and schooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  It's a long story really because it was my main life in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> from just before the war started until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there, and I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and at that point the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">By brother and I were locatedbilitted was the word--in a small <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where a very old lady and her middleaged daughter lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Her middleaged daughter was working, but it was really no environment for a teenage boy and girl so that within a very short period of time, we were reassigned separately, my brother to one <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and I to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And he stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> he was in and was very happy, went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in 1944 also. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I on the other hand was with a family where the woman actually had a nervous breakdown after I got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I kept hoping it wasn't me, and I don't think it was, but one of her neighbors who was a dear lady took me into her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">She had three other evacuees, and we all slept in one double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and there was a dog who scared me to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I had never had experience of a dog, and the first thing this dog did was to upset a hot cup of chocolate over my lap, but we got to like each other very much eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Your were three, four girls in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">double bed</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We were four girls in one double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> every two weeks, and it was a matter of putting money in the (?</span><span class="sentence" id="204">g1za?) </span><span class="sentence" id="205">to get hot water in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> where was really the only place you could get hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And we would take turns in being first, second, third, fourth in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathtub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And it was so cold that first winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I was not used to just having a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not heated because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we had had central heating, and we had hot water in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Here we had no hot water and worst of all, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> was outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  Was this a poor family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  I would say it was a lower middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But they were lovely people. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">The lady whom I called Auntie Nell, she had been educated age until 14; so she didn't have too much education, she could barely write. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Her husband was a fishmonger and eventually was called up into the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Thethe other children went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after this falsel forget what it was called, but in the first winter, there was no air raids so the children some of them did drift back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I stayed with Auntie Nell, and when her husband was called up, she and I grew very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">She had no children, and I had no mother; so she was very protective of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They had very little money, but I remember one birthday she gave me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> which enabled me to ride to schoolwhich I had to do twice a day because we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for lunchinstead of walking the two miles which was a long way to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">She was a lovely person. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I'm still in touch with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">She's just entered an <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  You say that the other children went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ; so did you have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Well, actually what we did was she and I slept in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">double bed</span> , and the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was rented out to another person to make a little more money because they really didn't have very much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">There was one man whoMr. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Watts, who came every summer and stayed with her while he was selling his ice cream, and I remember Mr. Watts coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and saying, "I want to stay with you this summer," and Auntie Nell said, "You're welcome." </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And he said, "What's this little girl doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Is she German?" </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And Auntie Nell said, "Yes, she's German." </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And he said, "Then I don't want to stay with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And she said, "That's perfectly all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The little girl is going to stay with me whether you stay or not." </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He finally relented and decided to stay there; so between being German and Jewish, it was hard <span class="DLF">road</span> to plow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Was Auntie Nell a devout Christian, and did shewhat was her feelings about you're being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She wasn't a devout Christian, but like most uneducated people, they felt Jews were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Now of course, since I lived with her for so long, she realized that I wasn't different, but in the beginning I had a diary which I locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It had a lock on it, and I would write in there when I was unhappy, and one day I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she had broken the lock on the diary and read my diary which then made me never write in the diary again. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But I didn't hold it against her because she really was very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">It made me unhappy for a little while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  What was it that she read in the diary? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Was it anything that effected your relationship toward her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  No, it wasn't because it was still in German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Are there any experiences while you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> that are particularly memorable to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Well, there are several. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">One was that due to the fact that we had only cold water to wash with and no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , I took a catlick in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in the morning, and one day my schoolteacher said to me, "Inga, you've got a dirty neck," which was very embarrassing and humiliating, and after that I even managed to wash my neck with cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">That was one experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Another one was went I was bicycling <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplane</span> very, very low in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , and I felt sure 1t was going toto machine gun me, and so I dashed off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and into a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> and of course that this (?</span><span class="sentence" id="249">hagencoits?) </span><span class="sentence" id="250">the swastika still frightened me so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  What happened to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I don't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It might have crashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We did have an air force base not too far from us called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tangmere</span> , and it could be that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German plane</span> was looking for this <span class="BUILDING">air force base</span> to bomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Back to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Any incidents or stories you want to tell me about going to Sunday school and going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  I sort of resented going to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> at <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and there was a dear old man who was in charge of <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , and whenever he called on me with a question, he would say, "My child of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aberham</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He always called me his child of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aberham</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And I would argue with him fiercely because I was very well acquainted with the Old Testament, of course not with the New, but it was something which came to mean a lot to me, and I got to the point where one night I dreamt about Jesus Christ, and I felt that, yes, I was converted, and it made me very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Jesus Christ to me was someone I could talk to anywhere, not just in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I would be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and I could talk to him or in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> or in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and somehow I remember Yahova as being a very strict god, a god who was jealous of his prerogatives and to me, I guess Jesus was more of a friend and father which I did not have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  Any other experiences at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="264"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> was a wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to grow up in. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and our stratum secondary school was housed in the Chichester High School building, and we had some <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that we worked in, and <span class="BUILDING">Chichester High School</span> had some <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that they worked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The teachers lived near the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and looked after us in many ways other than at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and when we were 16 years old, we were called before a counsel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> and asked whether we would give away any secrets to Germans who would promise us that our parents would be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  Who is this "we"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  We is my brother and myself, and so we said of course we wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Of course I never really knew what secrets we could possibly have known at age 16 to give away to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  Do you feel that the English were still very skeptical of you as Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  I think that they were not too skeptical of us because we didn't speak German anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Our English was perfect, and we were still children; so I don't think that we had any difficultly in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  Do you know what the motivation was behind this inquiry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Themany Germans at the beginning of the war had been interned and sent to the Isle of Man and were not allowed to stay in <span class="REGION">areas</span> which they considered to be important such as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> and so on, but wellyust like during the first world war, lots of people didn't play Wagner because he was a German composer. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So we were considered German refugees rather than Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It was just the fact that my brother and I were so young that saved us from being interned in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  You were considered German rather than Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Yes, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Yes, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> you returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Whom did you stay with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  I went back and stayed with the Denims. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">By that time, my foster brother had left and was in <span class="COUNTRY">Sri Lanka</span> and Marry was at <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> , and my brother had found himself a job with--with a lawyer somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So I was the only one that remained, and I stayed with the Denims. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I had one scholarship in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> and decided that I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span> because I was very much aware of the fact that I was being supported by people who were not my parents, and I also felt that if my parents were saved after the war, I would want to have a profession to look after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So I studied for a year to be a secretary shorthand in typing and bookkeeping and got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">London law office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  In this <span class="BUILDING">London law office</span> while you were working there, you remained with the Denims?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Yes, I remained with the Denims, and I don't remember paying them any money for staying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I must have offered it, but I guess they just didn't accept it, but I was very happy with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We went to to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> together because by that time I was converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I became a <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> teacher and mymymy remembrance is that Auntie Elsie took me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> to let them know that I had been converted, and they were not very happy about this, and I had some rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> who would write me letters and ask me to answer them to make sure that I knew what I was doing which I did for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  Your brother, what happened to his affiliation with Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  He had no affiliation to Judaism, but he also was not religious in any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He ended up marrying an English Christian girl and still lives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Did he raise his children with any affiliation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  None whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  And when you married, did you raise your children with any affiliation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  No, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">My husband is Jewish also refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he was not religious, and by that time I was no longer religious either so that we have brought up our children, he was in the foreign service. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We brought them up all over the world, and we wanted them to know about religions, but we were never religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Do your children identify themselves as Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  One daughter does because she is married to a Jew, and although they are not religious, they don't go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> at any time, but their son was Bar Mitzvah, so that's a sign of Judaism anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  And the other daughter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  The other daughter was never religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">She's a professional, and she's about to marry a Catholic gentleman who is not religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Did you have anymore experiences after you returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  Well, yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We had something called the doodlebugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And the V2 rockets which the Germans sent over; and for six weeks, were slept in an <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> with 300 other people, and we survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I got to work one morning, and the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> had been bombed, and we had to clear out glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I was with a friend one weekend, and I had been making a hat in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and after a doodlebug crashed nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It happened to end up in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We could never get to it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But we spent a lot of time cleaning up after these doodlebugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I didn't know anybody who had been hurt by them, because by that time people were sleeping in <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  What exactly are doodlebugs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  They are pilotless <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , really, rocketsthe first rockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And they were programmed to go down over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> such as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and they would make a noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">You could hear the motor, and all of a sudden the motor would stop, and within a few minutes it would crash so that whenever you heard the motor stop, you dove under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> because you were scared that it might crash right over you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  Did you continue to hear from your parents during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  We had a letter from our parents in 1941 just before they left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and asking us if we could raise a certain amount of money so they could go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Unfortunately, we couldn't raise the money, and so they did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I remember receiving one letter after they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , but after that we never did, and I think that we felt it was not possible to write to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We may have been wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Perhaps this could have been done, but we were so far away from anybody who could have given us any advice on this that we never did write and felt that 1f we wrote, it would be construed as writing to the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  What did happen to your parents, and how did you learn about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  My parents at one point in 1944 were sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I believe almost immediately killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The way I found this out was after the war, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a translator for the US War Department, and when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I used to go to the Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> every week to see if I could find their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I would put in the names of all my entire family, of whom there were 18 members, to see if anybody got out alive, but we heard from some lady who had met them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and she said that they had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And of course, their names never turned up. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Of all the people whom I put in traces for, only one aunt and one cousin were saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  All the rest perished?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  Everyone else perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Everyone else perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  Tell me more about your experience as a translator in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">When did you go there? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">What were the conditions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  We were trained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and given American uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Then we went to a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pullach</span> , which is outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and I was a translator of letters which had been confiscated for censorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Letters, that might have let us know where some Nazis were hiding so these could be prosecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I was only 18 at the time; so I was one of the youngest people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">All the camp consisted of elderly refugees who had been in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Also some AmericanAmericans who had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as refugees, all of us speaking German and English of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And I was there for two years, and after being there a year, and meeting some British people, I got to realize that I was really the only one who thought of myself as British. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Everybody else all, the other English people that I knew thought of me as a German refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">On the other hand, I felt that Americans had definitely assimilated, felt American, were treated as American and so I said okay I'm under 21, and I'm free, and I'm not close to my brother really, and my parents are dead, and I decided to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I wrote to an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> of whom I learned through her GI sons who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And I was sent an affidavit, and so at the ripe old age of 21, I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which was, apart from going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , probably one of the best decisions I could have made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  How did you learn about this opportunity to translate in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  I learned of it through a member of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , strangely enough, who told me that Americans were hiring British subjectsBritishnot necessarily citizens, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I felt that was the best way to find out about my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Did youwere you well paid? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Were you able to subsist on what you earned there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  We were very well paid, and I got to know a lot of people in the same position I was, and it was so wonderful to see the Germans so poor and humiliated and little kids collecting cigarette stubs, and I think those two years in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> got out of my system this terrible hatred that I bore for the Germans because after that, I was able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> as an American diplomatic wife and to treat Austrians like any other people which I may not have been able to do if I hadn't gotten this hatred out of my system.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  You have any other recollections of this time that you'd like to share with us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  Well, there is one more. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Little Binette which I feel very strongly about and that was the Denims always prayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> before going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and it was toward the end of war, in fact it was after the war, and it was just before I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pullach</span> that we were praying in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and after Uncle Norman finished his prayers Auntie Elsie, in a very unaccustomed manner because she never used to pray aloud, decided to pray, and say that if anything happened to my parents and they died, she could not believe that they would not go to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> just because they had not known Jesus Christ, and I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was so touching. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">It still makings me cry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  Thank you very much, Joan. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">This has been a very interesting and worthwhile history to share with the researchers of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
