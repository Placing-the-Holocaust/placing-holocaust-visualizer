<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  My name is David Yegher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">It’s spelled right now Yegher but it used to be J. Jegher. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name before the war at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I was called Chaim David and I was born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ronadeyjus</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian Mountains</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  What was the year of your birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  September 17, 1927. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my mother and father and we were a family of six children, three girls and three boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My two older sisters were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">One was living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget</span> and she had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She married a man by the name of Ignatz Hershkowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My second older sister was married and I don’t remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I know Ashmael but I don’t remember the family name. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Anyway the whole problem started with all the suffering we endured. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I was thirteen years old when we couldn’t go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we had to register and we had to close the <span class="DLF">front windows</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> facing the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Jews couldn’t travel on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was long- suffering and one day the military came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was a Friday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My mother was cooking the Shabbos dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  This was in 1940 about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  In 1944 and my mother was cooking the Shabbos dinner and of course we were all at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because we were not allowed to go anyplace and they told us whatever we can carry to make a package. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We have to go with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Were these iron guards who came or were these gendarmes or the military? </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Do you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  I really don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I just don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">All I know is that when we were leaving, whatever, we made a package that everybody could carry, whatever you could carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My mother was crying and telling my father, this is what we worked all our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">This is what we worked and tried to make a family life and try to make, you know, to eventually be able to achieve something and now we have everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">What we have now is just what we can carry 1n our bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We had a very prosperous <span class="DLF">farm</span> , orchard with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We had cattle, but my father was also what I would call it -------- transportation or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">What it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , it was primitive, there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , no <span class="BUILDING">machineries</span> but when anybody 1 wanted to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> my father drove two horses with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> that people got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  What <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> would you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And anybody wanted to come back, they also got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they came back and he was passing a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> on the way until we got where we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Also on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget</span> in the morning there was <span class="BUILDING">country stores</span> all in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> that my father stopped and got a list from the <span class="BUILDING">country stores</span> whatever it needed and he went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget</span> , bought it, brought it to them so they would have the things they were looking for, they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  So he made regular trips?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Every day except Shabbos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  These people would pay him for the ride into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So in other words there were many things that pertained to conduct a way of making a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">For instance, one way is to have transportation for people to bring them into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and also back. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And also on the way into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the farmers who had cows or sheep that milk, they had it in containers and we took the containers from them and we took it into the main creamery in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they made cream, whipped cream, butter and then we brought the empty containers back and we dropped them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We did this six days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">One way of making a living was taking in the milk which was also from our <span class="DLF">farm</span> and from the other farmers and picking up the list from the <span class="BUILDING">country store</span> ...
QUESTION:  Of their needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Of their needs, and a <span class="BUILDING">country store</span> was not just anything like you have a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I mean a <span class="BUILDING">country store</span> over there, we bought petroleum, we bought whiskey, we bought flour, we bought whatever in the world it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">A <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> everything that the farmers or the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And that was usually the only <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and therefore there were no separate <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> for this or separate <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So this is what we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  This was two horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It must have been a pretty large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">You could seat at least twenty people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  How long was the journey from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  About an hour and a half, two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Also it was big because of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> which you have to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was very steep <span class="DLF">hill</span> that it was very difficult to get up in the winter time or even when you had on the way from 2 the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that you were bringing back to the people flour and petroleum. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">This was very heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">When you loaded up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> it weighed like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> and to pull up the steep <span class="DLF">hills</span> , to cross over into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , it was very, very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  I suppose you had to help pull or push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , or did the horses manage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  The horses pushed and you put your elbow and you pushed along with them and a lot of times depending on the weather you just didn’t have enough power to pull it. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So we went to the nearby <span class="DLF">farm</span> and they came in and lend us another horse or two that we put up to help pull over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Just as hard as it was going to get up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , it was just as difficult getting down, to hold back all that weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And you got to the point where you were about holding it to the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> going down and then you just lost control and it would just shoot down and anything happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was God’s will. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Sometimes the horses were trying to hold it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They held it back as much as they could and then they just used to just like slide down on the hind legs on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and the weight from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> was just pulling them down and sometime one horse was holding back so hard that they pulled the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> into the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> on the side where the water was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Then we had a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We had to unload it, put everything on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> out and load it up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was a very hard life but it was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I mean we had a very, very strong family unity. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we always -- sometimes it was very little to eat and sometimes whatever it was we sat at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and we shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And my mother, may she rest in peace, she always fed everybody and sometimes there wasn’t anything left and she just went without. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I saw that myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Where were you in the range of children? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Were you one of the youngest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  No, I was the fourth one. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Then, of course, I had relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I had, of course, grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My mother’s side lived in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And, of course, my father’s parents lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My grandfather, both of my grandfathers had died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  While you were a kid they died or even before you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  They died before the problem started. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But my grandmother, my father’s mother, she was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> all the time, she was something wrong with her, and of course we carried her to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when we were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And we took her and she was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> even when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And of course my other grandmother was still walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Then my father had one brother and three sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  All living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ronadejus</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Two of them were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ronadejus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The others were living in some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My mother had a brother and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Her brother luckily enough before all this trouble started, he emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and his children, I mean 3 my uncle, I happened to see him after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He moved from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he died just about a couple of years ago now. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But his children, my cousins, are still living now. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But my mother’s two sisters, the husbands and the children, they all perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> My father was, they were very poor when they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They didn’t have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He started all of this so- called enterprises, whatever, a way that was needed and in order to be able to support the family and the money that he made from this -- taking all these things to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and everything else, we bought <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We had beautiful orchards with apples, pears, plums. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We ended up making our own whiskey because I remember big, big drums like they have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas storage tanks</span> that they used to put in all the fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And there was a little thing coming out from the bottom after whatever long it took, and the whiskey was coming out and we made our own wine and we also made our own dried fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And we sold it not only to the <span class="BUILDING">markets</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> at the time but we also sold it to the neighboring <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and this and that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  How did you manage to sell to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Was there a co-op set up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  So you must have produced a mass of dried fruit, a fairly large amount?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I remember when I was a little boy that in the summertime, whatever manure from the cows was piled up in big piles. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And in the wintertime when the snow was you chopped it up in chunks and you loaded it in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> and you hauled it into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> for fertilizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">During the daytime my father was taking care of whatever he had to do the business of, I don’t know what would you call that, transportation or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And at nighttime we worked in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  You’d better believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I mean that was the kind of situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There was no clock, there was no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You devoted your whole time working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And then, of course, when the summer came, you have to plow it and you plowed it with the horses not with tractors. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Every time you cleared more <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> to make more <span class="REGION">land</span> , clearing for <span class="REGION">farm land</span> to be able to. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">One time my oldest brother was already taken from us into what they called forced labor by the Hungarians because during my time when I was going in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which reminds me another situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When I was going in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was four years in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  This was <span class="BUILDING">Romanian public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Romanian public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I had very little time to do my homework because when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I had to do the chores in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did you have specific duties? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">4
ANSWER:  Yes I had to clean all the <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> and see that the milking cows were fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And my sister did my homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">As a matter of fact, when we started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I flunked the first year because I never did my homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But my sister that was a year younger from me, she started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the following year and she did her homework and she did my homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But I was bright enough that I really did very well not from studying at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , just for being in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and doing it when the teacher was doing the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Then the problem came when the Hungarian took over that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I started the fifth year in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with a Hungarian teacher that only spoke Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I never spoke Hungarian in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  It’s a foreign language to many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Yes and what happened was, I was very good in arithmetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We used to have tests like who could answer faster like five times five, five times three, eight times nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I always was the winner. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But we had the test in Hungarian and I lost because I had to transfer the Hungarian to Romanian or to Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Even today when I am figuring a bill, when I had my catering, people used to always be amazed because I figured in Yiddish, always.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Is that what you spoke at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Yiddish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Only Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I spoke Romanian in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then in the fifth year I had to learn Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And it was a very hard thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And one of the things that really hurt me --—- when we were leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , when they were taking us to --- they took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was one of the guys who was my best friend all my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  A Jewish guy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  No, a gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">His father was the post office man. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He delivered the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We were very close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We were practically every day together. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">When I was leaving, when we were taken, I had on a red sweater with no sleeves. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was man- made. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The guy that was taking us told me to take my sweater off. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Would you believe it I saw him take my sweater, he took it with a stick ---
QUESTION:  Didn’t want to touch it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  And he gave it to my best friend because my best friend asked him to get it for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And he was wearing a rifle but it was not a real one. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was made out of wood just so that he had the authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">This is something that I could never believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I never went back there and if I ever do I’m gonna take a sweater off him. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">If it’s the last thing in my life I’m gonna do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Were there many Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community?</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="162">What was the breakdown in terms of gentiles and Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">5
ANSWER:  There was about, for that time of the world it was considered to be a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was two hundred families. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And there was about half of them, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There was only one main <span class="DLF">street</span> that the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> consisted of, but there was a lot of <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in the <span class="DLF">back fields</span> and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Most of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , I would say seventy-five percent that were built on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> were Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The Jewish people had more or less -- 1t was even in those days like we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> that we were, you know the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was nothing but a <span class="INT_SPACE">mud floor</span> because I remember my mother once a week used to bring mud and make it soft with water and just take the hand and go over and give it a fresh go-over. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But still in all 1t had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and we were eating with knives and forks and we had kosher dairy dishes and meat dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">My father was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My mother was ---
QUESTION:  Chassid or ---?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay I can verify that because we have start times for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and end times for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  One thing I just don’t remember dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I just know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solopvina</span> we had tremendous suffering because aside from everything, sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and things like that, we just didn’t have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We were really suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And so I endangered my life by sneaking out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The way I did it, there was somebody going through because you see you have to go through guards and they checked everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The traffic still people were going on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We were not allowed to get near the main <span class="DLF">road</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  Was there a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Yeah, oh sure, there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and there was guards around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and also where the main <span class="DLF">road</span> was that went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that was also blocked off. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">If you had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you had to block the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , board it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> that had to be made higher so nobody could get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But I went over it and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with two horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">There were just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and horses that the local people were still using. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So what happened there is a long piece of wood that holds together the front wheels with the back wheels, that’s in the bottom like. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I put my legs onto that under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and my hands and I went through the checkpoint and when I got on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I guess whatever it was at that day I told them that we were being held in such and such a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and that we don’t have food and we’re starving and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I was able to manage to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> from somebody and I had a lot of people -- because you see my father was very honored and respected because of all the transactions and all the things that we did for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and for all the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> so everybody knew because if you wanted to send something to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> you got my father to carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">If you wanted to bring something <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you got my father to carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So we were very well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So when I came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and told them we’re starving and I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , I had from the farmers, they brought me all kinds of things and I loaded up a whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  You were able to get back to your old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  I got back to my old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but when I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I kept asking where the Gestapo was to make sure I don’t run into them. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And some of the people even helped me stay out so they couldn’t reach me. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I loaded one of these big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and I mean full with everything, with corn and potatoes and mostly that. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I found two horses that used to belong to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Of course I recognized them and I got them and I hitched them up and would you believe it I drove in through the <span class="DLF">checkpoint</span> and I was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> already and when I did, I wanted to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You know everything was blocked off. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">8
QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> itself was blocked off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the main <span class="DLF">road</span> , everything was <span class="DLF">fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">In order for me to be able to do this, I broke open whatever I was able to do, a <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I got in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I drove to where my mother and father were and what happened was my mother was so worried and so nervous and upset she used to bite the back of her hand to keep her --- she bit off her flesh because she was so upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And when I got there I yelled quickly whoever was available to unload quickly the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And when I did that after it was unloaded I took the two horses and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> back to the main <span class="DLF">road</span> and I slapped them 1n the back and I let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And nobody ever found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Did your mother know you were going to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Are you kidding? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">She would tie me up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  But she knew you were missing and she was --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Of course, because I was gone for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">As far as she was concerned she didn’t know if I am alive or if I am dead because when I had to do this I had to do it on the QT because I had to find out if I go another half a mile in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> am I running in. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They were looking for people like me that if you did something what they didn’t let you do they just hanged you and just let you hang in order to set an example.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Your whole family was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> except your oldest brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  He had been deported for forced labor earlier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He was in the <span class="DLF">Russian front line</span> behind the <span class="DLF">enemy line</span> digging <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and doing this kind of work and this is the only brother that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He is now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I know of another man who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> who was together with my brother in the same labor force. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So we were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were there until they brought more and more people, more Jews, till they rounded up all the Jews from all over the <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Did this take a couple of months or weeks, do you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  I would say maybe a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I really don’t remember dates because to me one day was just like another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I never knew --- as a matter of fact I didn’t even know the day that I was born because before I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> there was a lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who says to me I was young, under age, and somebody says to me one day, would you like to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I said what are you talking 9 about. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Anyway I said well they asked me the date I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But every time somebody asked me I just used whatever data just came to my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The latest was very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I used to say January first. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So this lady asked me where I was born and this lady asked me for my name and I never could believe she happened to write a letter to her organization UNRRA and one day she sees me in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she comes running after me and she says, look what I’ve got, look what I’ve got. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I’ve got your birth certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They send it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And so that’s what I knew the day I was born and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But you see my brother, I am Yegher and he is Taub. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The reason for that is because when the Jewish people got married, nobody ever realized that you have to go to <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> to get a license so when my older sisters and my older brother was born they were named after my mother because the laws didn’t consider them married because they weren’t married legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But then when they found out they had to have from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> a marriage certificate, then when I was born I became Yegher. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So everybody wants to know why your brother Taub and why I am Yegher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Yegher is your father’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Yegher is my father’s name and my mother’s name was Taub. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That’s why they are named Taub. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We’re in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and every day you know how you must feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">You had a beautiful whatever it was nice life, nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , nice situation, human beings live whatever it was and all of a sudden you are cramped in like I don’t have to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You put twenty people in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You could just sit on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , or whatever it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  Were you in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or was this a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">ANSWER:  There were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> like they have <span class="BUILDING">townhouses</span> here, one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">When they brought the people in from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> they just unloaded whatever --- we walked from the <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And when we walked they decided you go here and you go here and you go here. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">You split up the families and when it’s full they say go to the next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and you keep pushing in and pushing in until it’s full. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Once it’s full they go to the next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and this is how they packed them in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  You all managed to stay together though.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Well, once you get food in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> nobody stayed guard because you could walk around outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So if three people from one family was in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and three people from the other they just sort of stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Until one day -- you know the life, one of the things that kept people from losing their mind like my father, for instance, you pray every morning and you put tfillin and you daven every night and you worry about the Shabbos and you keep things sort of something to do so you don’t go out of your mind and this is what usually happened the whole time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  They didn’t assign labor or anything like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">10

<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  Yes, I found that out. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">When we got there, I’m the only one that was going to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">My sisters were young, good healthy women, grew up on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , worked the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , but because they had their children, they went to the left -- my mother, my younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I went to the right with the man and I knew that the sister 13 who was a year younger than me also went to the right but I talked to people after the war that she ended up in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But I was the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Now I’m talking to you what I told you a whole generation of uncles and aunts and families and people and the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I don’t know if a dozen people survived from the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And I landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But then while I was there it didn’t take long for me to find out because the next morning I was asking what happened to the people and somebody was showing me the smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  Another prisoner you asked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Yeah, that was there before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So when I found out about what in the world was happening with this and that, what can Ido? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">When I got there they shaved off my hair and they gave me a striped suit and they gave me a pair of shoes with wood soles and cloth and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And I was living, I saw in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , flat, which was eight or ten people in three layers. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And when one turned, everybody had to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So I was in one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And one day I got separated from all the people that was from my <span class="REGION">area</span> because somebody told me one day that this is where the people get numbers and they are being shipped out to work instead of sending them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I saw a <span class="DLF">line</span> one day: I was way across in another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I took my chance and I ran and I got in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And sure enough I got a number and I was put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were taken to a <span class="NPIP">desert place</span> which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Obershlazingen</span> and I landed up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I since found out that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> had four <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was <span class="BUILDING">Gleiwitz one</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz two</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Gleiwitz three</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz four</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz two</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And when we got there, there was nothing but <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were already built and it had electric wires around and with the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And when we opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , one <span class="DLF">gate</span> it had where the Gestapo came into in and out bringing out the people and one <span class="DLF">gate</span> is to the side where you went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And then they also divided the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> though they didn’t put electric wires was just a <span class="DLF">fence</span> with two <span class="DLF">gates</span> and they made women. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Because afterwards, like after we got there, we dug down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and we pushed it like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal cars</span> and we built a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They brought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machineries</span> , I’m never going to forget this, we built the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">What we did is we mixed the cement by hand, seven shovels of sand, one shovel of cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Then you kick it back and forth, then you make a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the middle, then you put so much water and you mix it. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But this was like eight stories high. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We brought the cement eight stories with a wheel barrel. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I still have here, you see this, you were not allowed to stop and I was exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I got to the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> , I put the thing down for a second, he hit me with a piece of steel and cracked my skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And so we were over there and the women came in to monitor -- it was long tubes, steel, it had little fires and it was turning and it was creating some kind of black sword (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="455">and the women were taking care of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They were taught how to put the sword and when it fills up, tie it up and put a new one in. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">There was a whole shift and we were continue building more <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , more thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And I lost my left ear, my mastoid because I was young, energetic, and after we came back from work, from 14 working in the construction, <span class="BUILDING">building</span> all day long, the Gestapo, they had the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> outside they wanted to have beautiful <span class="DLF">flower gardens</span> and polish their shoes and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And I was a farm boy, I knew how to work with dirt and make these things and I made a <span class="DLF">flower gardens</span> and I did keeping up with their <span class="DLF">fields</span> , whatever it is in front of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and I cleaned the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and I used to get extra soup for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  You did this in addition to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  In addition, of course, because when you were working in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , they did not give you enough food for you to be able to continue working and continue living. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They have it calculated to give you just enough food to keep you alive but to extract from you all the strength so you become weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And believe me the way they did it there was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> all the way around the <span class="DLF">fences</span> , there was one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They called the people out and you have to get in five ina row. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And then they make you run around this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , the center <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">When you ran around and then when you got weak and they started hitting you, you had to run faster, faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">The guy that was doing this, where he ran behind everybody, when he saw the people that he overtook, he stopped right there, those people were not strong enough to live anymore, to produce work, they went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Because they had more people, they brought Jews from all over the world in Europe and they wanted the healthy one to make use of their strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But I was always running fast and I was always able to keep up and that’s how I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But what happened is when I did all this extra work I got extra soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And one day this same guy that was asking for volunteers and I always went and I did and he dug a ladle and he gave me the soup and you saw all the rest of the people just dying to get a bite of something and nobody could get nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">You see them dying, starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But then he asked for a volunteer to wash the kettle out. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And I was very gladly going to wash the kettle because this guy didn’t care about how he dipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The best stuff was in the bottom of the kettle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  This was another prisoner, this guy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  No, this was one of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And when I come there to volunteer to wash the kettle and I was one of the volunteers, I already got a bowl of soup, I heard him say to me, you swine and he hit me on my side with his right hand and he busted my ear drum. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And since then I had nothing but pain and even after I got liberated, I went to doctors in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and doctors in everywhere and I finally ended up here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> a place with the <span class="BUILDING">ear clinic</span> where a doctor said to me, I have one choice, have the operation because it’s so deteriorated that it’s going to affect my brain and it’s pressing against my brain and that I don’t have much to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So I authorized him to operate on me and he took the mastoid out completely and I have a mastoid, a plastic one and I don’t hear in my left ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But thank God the operation was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">The doctor told me I would have to come in and check-ups and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But thank God whatever it did it took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I go 15 to see him every couple of years or so and I have no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So anyway I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  How did they take you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> , again by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  Where did you find the potato?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  I found it someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But would you believe it I couldn’t accomplish my goal because I didn’t have the strength after I found a match. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I couldn’t have the strength to light the match. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Could you believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I was getting weaker and weaker and weaker by the minute and I was already in a situation that I didn’t know, I didn’t know, I couldn’t get up, I couldn’t move and I was ----- but I don’t know what happened in the next I don’t even know how many days, I just don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">All I know is I was lifting my head one day and I saw the Germans running and the British running after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Then I looked again and I saw the British running back and the Germans running after the British.</span></p>
