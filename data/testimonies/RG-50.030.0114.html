<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  I was a little girl in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , coming from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , no boys, just homework and playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father was a wealthy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My man was...if I remember my mother was never feeling well, so she has a special woman taking care of...for the children, governess, and for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And we had a maid at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had only about 2,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh...My father was...uh...taking care of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and___ meaning riches. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">If someone had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and maked a living, he was rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father had _ you know and we...I think he was wealthy, and we were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">For the summer we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I had three brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The first after me was Moshe, the second was Abraham, and the third was Fishel. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There was younger, rich, but one year... We were a happy family. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My mother had 5 sisters and | brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The brother was a very rich man. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He didn't live too long in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was like 32 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarczyn</span> , and with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> it's 30 minutes away. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So we very often went. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother...like for a dress or for a hat or for something and always in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I had a happy life til 1939, til the war broked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they told us we have to wear masks because they were afraid for the gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They said they will supply, you know, the...uh...with gas so I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the war broke out in September the Sth, 39,’ and my life was shattered right away because my...we were afraid they will call my father to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My father was only 39 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So my father was a very religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">To the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> what he possessed he had two partners. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">One partner which was like a relative to us and they started in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when they ' beginning of the Second World War September 1, 1939 were young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My grandmother died when she was 28 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My father was 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And he had a stepmother like from a book, not a good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So he was troubling and...uh...his friend was in the same position also without a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So they start like to doing business about 10, 11 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And they remained after 60 years partners like they're just relatives, and with the kids...with the children we were also like relatives til today. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So my father with this partner went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to this Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What the Rabbi said if he will be going to the army or should he stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarczyn</span> or should he go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So the Rabbi said that he wouldn't go to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The Polish army doesn't need him. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He's too old, 39 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But he should come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So my father came back the same day and when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I...I saw that the maids are taking everything out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> and packing in sacks, in big, long sacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So I said, "What's this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So my mother took me aside and she said, "Eat your supper.” </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I still remember what the supper was. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Fish, fried fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And..uh..we're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And right away the men came. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He took all the possessions from the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we had our own horses through the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> , you know, so everything like...was like a...we called this a Wagen, you know, like you see in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when the...the...the <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , you know, and the horses, the big Wagens, and we took every...I mean they took everything on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Wagen</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Our family and my father's partner's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My father stood still yet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarczyn</span> , but my mother and the children and the maid and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was a hectic night. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The kids all were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We were upset, and what we heard was boom, boom, boom...the artillery and the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> we came to a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , friends of mine parents were still....on the <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> because it was summer in Europe and we...this was ___, and we took their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but we didn't remain too long in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because the Polish army moved in...in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the...you know, so we were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So my mother called her brother if we could come to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So my brothers and myself and my mother came to my uncle,__————— 23: in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Two days later my father arrived and we been together. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And that day the war started and there was fires and it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But we still together. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Not only us because then was bombed this...uh...uh....<span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Granichna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So my father's partner came over with his family together to us, and we stood together til the German occuped <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So the first day we wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarczyn</span> because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...1t wasn't yet a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but we were like, you know, just us, and we didn't have too much food because we left everything behind and what we had we left in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Granichna</span> and it was bombed after two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But my father went to a baker who bought from our business flour, and he gave us a whole, like 50 pounds, a 100 pounds of flour, and my father brought it to the...my uncle and my mother and my aunt baked hallahs, bread, so we had to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But was a hard time with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We didn't have water. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So we put on...on...for the children...for us...like for me, it was like a game you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We were small. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We didn't understand so much...on a pot, a belt to carry the water and we went to the Visla (ph) for the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was like a half hour maybe, a hour walk but til we were loaded with water, was heavy the pot, you know, to carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That's the way we brought the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Till my father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was my birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding from the bombs and I said, "That's my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I maybe get killed from the bombs.” </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And in the same day my father was...went to the Rabbi with my two brothers on the ____———. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He was...by the Rabbi...what he believed in this Rabbi, and a bomb went in...in this shelter and the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, "Is this how you so holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?" </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So the Rabbi said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And all of a sudden like a <span class="DLF">window</span> was opening in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and my father was out from the...from the, you know, bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , from the <span class="DLF">shrapnels</span> , and he pulled out my brothers, the two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They were injured, the face and scratches and he took and then he slipped out the Rabbi too and they came to us in the evening and the Rabbi...and we couldn't stay in my uncle's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> anymore because he lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> so we went to stay in a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They had a <span class="BUILDING">dairy store</span> with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They didn't have children, two old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So they agreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He was a very holy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we also stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Not only us, but practically the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of people were standing like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And then when the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so my father...somebody came already and said our <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> was bombed and we have nothing to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, "Where are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What I am going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Everything is bombed?" </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And the Rabbi said, "Believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Not you....uh...not you <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> 1s...1s bombed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="99">In the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My mother's brother was a very rich man. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He had a <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> what my father and actually my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> was bombed and burned and ours was partly burned but not completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So my mother wasn't able to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We didn't had any communication to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarczyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So we start to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Myself, my father and mine...one of mine brothers, and my father's partner and his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I will name him Mr. Leshno and another two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It was a distant relative of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He also went with his son to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarezyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">32 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We maked it in a few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We get to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But we came near to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The smell was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">From fire, from bodies, from sweat. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we saw as we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...uh...I could...everybody could see our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and it was like the edge burned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and in behind was our <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So we came back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we didn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because the war was going ___ we didn't suspect that we will have to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So that was good for us, that we had right away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Also a cousin of mine moved in to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was burned and she actually saved this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because...with water...was no firemen at the time...so with water, with buckets of water she saved this fire shouldn't go farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And we were again happy to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">As a child you ask me what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I remember I was afraid to sleep in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> because after all...uh...the two, three weeks I didn't sleep in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I was always sitting or lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I went to mine aunt, mine father's sister to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">She had a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and she had a girl, my cousin, mine age. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we like each other very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I said I would sleep with my cousin Hilda, and I don't want to sleep at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So my mother said, "Fine.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Oh...and at the time my mother came also to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I ran around to my aunt's to see if everybody 1s alive, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a square and a lot of Germans in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I was very much afraid and people were running up to the Germans with a cigarette to sell bread or something and I slept this night by my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In the morning about 7 o'clock, my father came in and talked something to my aunt and I was very anxious to know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And they didn't want to tell me...a child...what happened during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">That the German with the Poles come into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from the fire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They took him on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They wanted money. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So my father said he has no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He has the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And it's after the war and I don't have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a person like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So my father was afraid to go to his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> a tailor was living there, without children, a nice old Jewish poor people. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So he went into them and he sat til the morning there. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And it was the first night in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my aunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It didn't took too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It took about maybe 2 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My father decided he's going to be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He cannot live like this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">First, they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and later will go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They said goodbye to us and my mother was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She screamed, "I am already a widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">How do you leave me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with the maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">The maid had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was a Jewish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And my father disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We didn't know what and where and what. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Occasionally we got...I mean my mother got...just had the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything 1s alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Maybe we'll some day be able to join him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So...uh...we stood together in this <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  The song...if I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Was something from my long <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I could get out some more, but very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">As I say til this point, til I went to work, I...I...childish...you know, I didn't give too much thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I'm young and I didn't think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I didn't realize that there could be such a terrible thing done to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Uh...So finally it came, this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">That's when we...that we heard...1t was all over the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Papers pasted out that all the Jews had to come to one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and this was this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was three <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">One <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> ...(clearing throat)...one <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> was Tebins, the biggest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The other one was...uh...I just remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Fo Broczes (ph) I don't...I just remembered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Schultz. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Schultz was working the same work what we. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So the...the...the rumors were that Schultz and Tebins were going to go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And the Broczes (ph) which was in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they only work by Broczes (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They will remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But it...1t was just rumors, you know. (</span><span class="sentence" id="434">Sigh) So we were living....this was already a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Hungry, working, and no future. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Uh...But when these signs on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were that everybody has to come in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , my mother didn't have a card. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So I took out this card and I said, "Mommy, this is your card and you go with daddy and you take both children" ...because my brother is very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">My age I was 14 I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I was already big. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I was very tall and thin. </span><span

id="446">You will write me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And hardly my mother accept this Kenncard, but she did accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Until the middle of 18 we still could work together in the <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Was six people in the <span class="DLF">line</span> , end of it, and the <span class="DLF">line</span> it was really not to prescribe...not to describe how long it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It was a terrible way down. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The heat was maybe a 150. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Nobody had a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The _____ on the back, the shoulder bags...everybody had a bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I had a few slices of bread and I think an onion in it and my clothes and like a girl, you know, a pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I also...when my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was looted in...uh...<span class="BUILDING">Karmiska 15</span> , I went back with the maid so I find my mother's beautiful pair of snake shoes and I always liked them so I took the shoes and I took them to mine so I was holding the shoes too. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">As we was marching I saw in the <span class="DLF">line</span> my aunt and my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">That's the rich one. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And her two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And another aunt, my mother's sister.

another two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I didn't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I know them only from the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And this girl was probably mine age, but she had her mother and her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And I was really jealous because all three had cards and I didn't had a card. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I think this was my first ttme when I start to be jealous of anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And thank God this girl survived and her parents survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Not the war, but to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And we were in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Because I didn't had a card, and my uncle and my aunt didn't had a card, so we went to the...with them, and I separate from my mother in case...and no words to talk, but crying and crying and write and don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Ma, your health you know, and you will survive and we'll survive this. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">As a child, you know, I could feel I didn't have too much words to...to comfort her, and she and my father went different <span class="NPIP">place</span> because they had the cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">My mother was struggling with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">She wants me to get a card, but I was very much against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I felt young and strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And they went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">As we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moranofska</span> (ph), with us all and we stood and I said to this Henry...he was like a brother to me...I said, "Henry, we don't know where we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We here with the aunt with this, but why can't we still go to be with my mother...with our parents.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He had a second mother, but very good woman and like I start... was...I'm a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We're very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And I start to agitate him, "Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Let's go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Me...and I make his brother also to come, and the three of us start to look for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And as we're looking on the Miligas we knew a lot of people and they said, "Oh, you're father is looking for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="490">In the same time my father start looking for us because they saw it's...it's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Everybody could still still be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Was a terrible hot day. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Humid. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Without a little water. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Finally, we find my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">My father said, "Thank God, we find you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And we came to <span class="BUILDING">Miller 22</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">There is the place where my mother sat on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and about an hour or so even my uncle come with his wife because we saw we're not separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We could be all together and we find a

id="502">So, of course, my father was starting to look for me for one. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Couldn't get! </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But my mother said, ————s They don't let parents with children through. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Just the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Let me give back to Cywia the card. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And you go with Cywia and I stay behind with my family, with the brothers, with the sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">She still had her brother. </span><span class="sentence"

Before you make the shoes...a shoe, you know, the leather has to be sewn together so then the shoemaker takes the shoes to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Anyway he worked for the Germans, but he didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to live so he lived with us because...he moved in by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="634"><span class="INT_SPACE">Apartment</span> was empty so. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So then we agreed that he should have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And day and night we went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">We came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">We didn't have any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">We lived only what they gave us, but my father had a few gold pieces sewn in his shoes or on the suit and I also had before we went like the everybody had some money because we didn't go...maybe we knew it <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , but nobody want to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We were sure we're going to work for the Germans, maybe to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , maybe by ____ summertime or whatever you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So we had a few dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I mean slotas not dollars in case we have to buy something, a piece of bread or to bribe somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The bribe was terrible in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at this time between the Jews also. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So as a child I was wearing stockings but I didn't wear a belt, but elastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So two eleastic together and in between was money sewn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">That was mine possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So little by little we came over to this because we didn't have anything to live on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And that's how we lived til 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The rumors were that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> wouldn't stay too long, that they will finish us. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And in between they opened the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">No more transportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I mean they liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> little by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">The same thing and they opened the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they heard we were free from work, that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was open, the miller. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We run, myself, my father, everybody, the whole <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> run there to look for relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We went straight to <span class="BUILDING">Miller 22</span> because we know we left there my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We came...on the <span class="DLF">street</span> somebody screamed, "Uncle Mendel.” </span><span class="sentence" id="657">My father's name was Mendel. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">This was my aunt's little boy, 8...7...8 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He was together with everybody, with my mother, with the brother in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So we asked him, "Where is everybody?" </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We didn't have to go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">He gave us all the report. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He told us what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Two woman in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I don't know all the words. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And the Germans heard because they were snooping around with the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So they came in and they find the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that there is a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and they were hiding there and they start to scream that they're going to put a tear bomb in the ducts. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They should come out so they will be free to work and live. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Otherwise, they will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So everybody went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">This little boy didn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He sit and he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">My brother, the youngster, didn't go out, but my mother didn't want to leave, that she should come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">She wouldn't leave without him. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So the Germans stayed til he came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">That's the version from this little cousin of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And then when he came down they left and took them all to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">This was day before our New Year, exactly September 9, 42. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So we know so much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But everybody said, "Let's go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He's a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Maybe he doesn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">You have to touch it to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So we came to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and when they saw me...a few people..."Oh, my God, you're such a pretty child. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Your mother showed us pictures from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">She was crying all the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Poor woman if she wouldn't go out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So we knew it already that's...that's the story what the little boy told is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">As we were there the German were smart, so they start a new selection and they start to catch people from the <span class="DLF">street</span> because they had all amount that they wanted, card or no card. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So we start to...to hide again. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">But luckily, to tell you the truth I don't know how, I...we came...my father, myself and the rest of us back to the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We didn't go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We were afraid that maybe they will take us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We wanted to spend as much as we could in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">It wasn't safe, but better than at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">You know I worked in the night time. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I...I fell asleep during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I couldn't sit in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They wouldn't let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So I stood mostly in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And this same time my father met an acquaintance and he said, "You know, I am looking for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Your son come to me from <span class="BUILDING">Miller 22"</span> ...he was also from the <span class="BUILDING">Miller 22</span> ..."and he said, "David, maybe you have a better...better <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> where I could hide with my brother and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I have the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I will give you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And he told this my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And I said, "In my <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> is just the amount of people what we could go in, so I couldn't take him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So my father was very abusive that he couldn't...that my brother was saved with mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">But he said, "Please believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I couldn't do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="710">This man was a very selfish man and a very rich man. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So my father said, "And what you doing now.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="712">I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So my father said, "It's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And he with his wife and child came to live together in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I give even away my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to his wife because she was a very sick woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">She didn't look like Jewish at all with a little girl 3 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">This woman survived the war thanks to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Many days I didn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I was afraid and my work was in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So I was hiding under my covers and I said, "I don't care if I live or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">What do I have to lose. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">My mother is not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">My father is working. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I can't talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And I have...I am always hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I don't know how to cook and I have nothing to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So what's the use of living.” </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So he said and I was already 16 or 17 years old and this woman was very nice, but she had what to eat and she never shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">She never would say, "Oh, Cywia take a biscuit or something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="731">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Mine little cousin when we met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">He was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">He stole from her things to eat and one day I give him an address and I said to him, "You know, you have nothing to lose. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Go over the...the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Go to the Irish, to the Poles and go to my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">She will know who you are, and tell her that you're hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Maybe she will give you a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">He went. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He ate a good meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He brought me a bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So this family...he had a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">She was hiding two little sacks under my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">She was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I never looked in into the ___ believe me and I didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And one day, looking out from the <span class="DLF">window</span> ...was in the day time, I saw that the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was like this that Germans are in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">They are looking for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So I took the cover over my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And I said, "I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">If they come, they will come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So she put the little girl under my cover and she sat on the side and all of a sudden boom boom boom on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , but nobody was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">It was like dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Pretend there is nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">After a few minutes it was quiet and so they went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Okay? (</span><span class="sentence" id="759">Sigh) Since this day, I said I am not staying here anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Because it was in my head if they take this little girl and I will see how they kill her...how they will kill me, I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I wouldn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">But to see before how they kill her, I don't want to see 1t. So I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I mean I didn't work because my work was into the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And I stood there as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So I stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">My father find out that...uh...my two cousins are alive and they work by the brocz (ph) shop in the brocz (ph) shop. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I also forgot to mention that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when I still had this good life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I went from day to day with mine...we were lived together with more people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Uh...So I met _____. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Maybe you heard about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">What I went there because cousin's little boys to...uh...were sheltered there. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">My father's sister's children. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was a holiday or something and it was like a <span class="BUILDING">children's theater</span> and my aunt said to me maybe you would come to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">My grandfather was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in January 1941...or may it was 1n 42. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I think 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And my father maked a separate burial because there was...in dozens they put. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But he was a very religious man and a decent man so he dug by himself the...the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So I went and I met there a lot of people and I met him too. (</span><span class="sentence" id="782">Sigh) So this was the life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> til my father came and he was talking with people and the rumors were that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> wouldn't be too long that Tebins and Schultz are going together. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">We have to look to escape the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Where to escape nobody knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But people did if they were bought...uh...Polish papers that they not more Jews, but Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I couldn't do this because I looked very much as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I thought a German wouldn't recognize me if I am tall Jew or a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">But the anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Ninety percent of Poles worked hand 1n hand with the Jews....with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So...but in the other way you didn't have nothing to lose. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So one day this couple came to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They didn't have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">They were from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They were also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And they said, "We have somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">We're going to go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">If you want, maybe you could join us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They maybe wouldn't confirm this to my father, but they were looking for money in case if the people wouldn't take them without money. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">So maybe my father could pay for them too and this way they will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So my father said, "In this minute I am not considering so much myself but mine baby, my daughter.” </span><span class="sentence" id="801">So he...my father came to me and he said, "What would you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Would you like to go with Lea and Abraham to the <span class="REGION">Irish side</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I said, "Not by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Only with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="805">It was summer when they took away my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I didn't have any other clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I didn't have winter clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So my father went and bought me a pair of boots and he prepared me and still from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> not woman, mostly men, young boys went out to the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">They called this the <span class="REGION">Irish side</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">They could have come in with two potatoes with a half bread, whatever, you know, and that's like the other people could buy and live also. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So one day my father comes and says, "They are leaving soon and I am convinced that you should go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So when Leshno heard that I am going, he wanted to send his son too. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And by the time was a person who lived actually in...in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> there in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , going from <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...from farmer to farmer and they knew him and they give him something to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So he went out with Leshno, with this young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Uh...And my father came and he said, "Now is the time and you're going in 2 days and don't tell anybody where you're going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But I couldn't hold a secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I said, "If I want to survive, I would like my cousin to survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="818">But this time this little boy wasn't with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">We send him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Go and look you should live. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Because a child, they didn't know he is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">He was a blond, pretty little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So he wasn't anymore with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And everybody was laughing with that...his face like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I had long braids, black and really looking like a Jewish girl, but my Polish was perfect. (</span><span class="sentence" id="826">Sigh) It's...I mean I had no other opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">My father says, "But I wanted to...leave my secret to my other cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">He was a very intelligent boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He was older than I was, few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I said, "Listen __, anytime you escape the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , come to this and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I knew already this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">My father told me because in 2 days I have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But don't write it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Just
