ANSWER:  I don't know, it's some kind of brown, uh, well most of us either wore blue or gray, or what not, but I wore brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">This guy from Desow(ph) he once came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and asked his mother, Tammy(ph), what is being Jew and then the mother said, well Jew, she didn't say Jewish like you, no, no, she said well the Jew, this is like Putnik. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">So, now I understand he said, the Jews are those who walk around with thier brown outfits. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Anyhow, from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I graduated into the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> of the fine arts, by the way, also been a pupil, uh, and later I went to, we ought to now reach 1940, uh, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I finished the other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was a remarkable free <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I joined the Sengre(ph), the <span class="BUILDING">Sengre School</span> , one of the best in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coopenhagen</span> , by the way, where the master, the chief, rector, whatever they are called was married to a Jewish woman who had been my father's teacher in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">You know it's a very, very small community, both the Jewish and the non-Jewish community are very interwoven. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">At any rate, so I, this was 1943 I joined this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ,
QUESTION:  This is when you(ph) joined the occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  This was after the Germans in 1940 had occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  How did that effect your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Well, you know, interesting that they Germans made a deal with the Danish Government. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So, when the German occupation was rather non-violent a few Danish soliders put up resistance because they didn't want to listen to the orders from the superiors to lay down their arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Janisport(ph</span> ) when the Germans just marched into <span class="REGION">neutral Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had to know that of course they could provide heroes, get heroes had they fought. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But they had no political or military power to assist the Danish, the German occupation forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Demark succumbed, made a deal with the Germans, a deal by the way which is of great significance to our life as Jews because that set us apart from the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, <span class="REGION">occupied Europe</span> , because the made a deal with the Germans based on a kind of mutual respect, so to say, Sharing of, sharing of authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">The Danes(ph) got permission from the Germans to go on with their normal lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Political parties were non-functioning, the <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> went on giving laws, the government was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , the King was riding through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> followed by a crowd of school children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the occupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were effected by the war and by the supply situation, but basically the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We had two, we had two free parliamentary elections <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> during the German occupation and the last one, the Nazi party, was simply trashed and the Germans didn't, didn't interfere. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The Germans on their side of course wanted the Danes(ph) to let the Germans go on, so to say, building fortresses along the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> to protect against a possible allied invasion and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was supposed to be kind of supplying people for the Germans so the last part of the agricultural production(ph) went to the German army and the last part of the industrial production went to, so <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> as a matter of fact became kind of unwilling, but still partner to the German war effort, one has to admit that, but this, sorry yes...
QUESTION:  Let me ask you about the Jewish community and your family in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Did they feel threatened, vulnerable, did they feel...
ANSWER:  no, no, no...
QUESTION:  They felt protected by the Danes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Well the Danish government, this of course we did not know, but we know today. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The Danish government told the Germans that there were a number of <span class="DLF">red lines</span> which the Germans were supposed to respect in order to protect Danish sovreignty. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">One of the <span class="DLF">red lines</span> was that no distinction between Danish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Meaning that no special anti-Jewish legislation, no interference with Jewish life at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were operating the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , were operating the <span class="BUILDING">old age homes</span> , whatever you had so the structure of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> remained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the famous day of 29th of August 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew about what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in September, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we were related to the community, intermarriage between the communities and youthful activities, we didn't know because we kind of lived in empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , we didn't have information. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We could hear pbc of course, but pbc didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> for instance, and the allies did not consider this a very important item in the news broadcasting, so we lived as a matter of fact in a fools paradise. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Being persuaded to believe that the normal life we lived could continue without end. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">In the Danish community, by the way, was influenced by the Danish patricians, the Danish officials went on telling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the Jews this is what you call , this would be cause for war and then we would resign and the Germans would have to run the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The Germans at that time did not necessarily have the desire to turn this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which was serving their ends into a hostile <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which they would have to occupy with tens of thousands of soldiers which they needed somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So there was kind of a balance based on communal interest, the Danish wanted to run the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> safely out of the war the Germans wanted to have as much peace as possible to concentrate their efforts in another <span class="NPIP">front</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Were there Jews who went into the resistance, the...
ANSWER:  I wanted to come to this because one of the things that was posted on us was not to get involved with the emerging resistance, don't get the resistance started, acting to be a popular movement only after the mid or end 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Until then resistance was some groups committing small sabotage acts, publishing newspapers, but it was not something which the Germans at all felt threatened by, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people, but didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-German agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">People bother, but they have no effect on the German war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So, we were told don't join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Now I was at that time at the age of 15 and of course I joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">If people told me not to do it and it happened so that the famous communist , It was a schoolmate of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We started selling illegal newspapers and books published by the emerging resistance in order to finance their activities, they sold these books to underground of course, it was banned by the Germans, banned by the authorities, by the censor, the Danes had a post on <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The Danes in order to prevent annoying the Germans too much, so one of the books I remember was by John Steinbeck. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He was a part of the German occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He write, not a very sophisticated book, what it was, it served the purpose of these times. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So, we were and of course the first thing you did was to settle to your family, but at any rate this was discolored by my father who was a member of the Jewish, one of the Jewish community agencies, member of the board or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So of course he was more exposed(ph) than others because the Germans, as you know, that there had been always before going for the Jews in the community to take all the members of the leadership of the community simply to deprive the rest of the Jews from any leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">This is the way they used to handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So my father was very unnerved, you've got to do this because that might put me, the family, the community in a very sensitive dangerous position. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I didn't want to listen to my father and he of course, what do you do, you call the chief Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">At that time chief Rabbis were not administrators of community affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They were people, imposing people with beards, you know and supposed to harbor a certain amount of wisdom. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So I was told to go to the chief Rabbi.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  This is Fleetiger(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  His name was Max Fleetiger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He was originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He spoke in the Danish language, but of course speaking with a heavy Hungarian accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Later he was taken by the Germans and brought to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and survived and came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But, I still remember, there are some parts in history which you remember vividly where you are standing or sitting with the other guy, like the story with the typing, I remember that I was asked to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I was standing up and he was sitting behind a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> with his , his and had a beard like or square, long beard, very well groomed, but you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They told me that they, he ordered me to give up all this playing around and he said, I remember this today, if you don't give it up, you and others of your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of the Jewish community because if the Germans catch you or the Danes catch you revenge might be taken and that might put the whole safety of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So, give it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The moment that you have been told that you have the responsibility for a whole community and you're only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I burnt, and burnt all that was left of the illegal books and newspapers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">That must have been immediately before the trip to or immediately after. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But you know that in 1943, August there was a clash between the Danes and the German interest and to put it shortly the Danes resigned and the Danish Government retired and the Parliament went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the King went into exile in his <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> and the Shee(ph) which has protected us from German encroachment was removed overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Suddenly there were only Germans and us. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The Germans didn't have to anymore consider this deal about you stick to your things and we'll stick to our things and the Jewish we are leaving behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So at that time, 1943 August, about half of the Jewish community of Europe had been destroyed by the holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We didn't know a thing, we didn't prepare a thing, the community did not try to build up kind of work preparing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We were ==, we were____, I remember my father went to the Director of the Foreign Ministry, during these days, of course we had a feeling that the situation had changed dramatically and that of course would change our situation, but we just didn't know how and he went to the Director of Foreign Ministry, who was living in the neighboring <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he asked me what's new so he said, don't worry, I have contact with the Germans all of the time and if anything is cropping up, we will warn you, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Well, of course something cropped up, mainly the German Nazi against the Jews on the 2nd of October and he never warned us. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I just want to tell in brackets a little human angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We escaped of course and came back a couple of years(ph) later from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and right after our return my parents sent this, by then had retired, a big bunch of flowers saying, don't worry, you didn't warn us but we got away and safely we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Now, whether they heard anything from me or not, I don't know, it was a very, very difficult situation of course, being faced with this old preach of promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But many, many years later when I was serving as chief editor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put___,(ph) maybe 50 years later...and one of our staff members aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very easy because he sort of wanted to stay out of the limelight. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I called him and asked him to make an exception and our reporter. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunch of flowers I received one night which I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">These were the flowers which your parents sent me in 1945 after you came back from refuge in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It meant a lot to him that some people were trying to forgive him for having broken his promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">At any rate, so the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had control over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The Germans wanted the Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews they sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Well it's a long story, but the Danes refused the whole set up, so to say once abolished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with the mark in their hands and . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Then come September, September month and somebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph) with regard to our situation as Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But suffice here to say that the Germans decided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at that time and they ordered three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and anchor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> preparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish authorities who had not yet been released, not succeeded in being released when the authorities went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So the Germans simply arrested them as one of the most, most dishonorable, dishonorable events in modern day history, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Of course they were arrested and kept against the constitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Anyhow, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were prepared to take 7,000 Jews and a few hundred communists to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , whatever they planned to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But then something happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came from the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a '"W", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the entire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German cooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But for his own reasons, which is a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much more versed into the details than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told one of his collaborators in the German, in the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">A fellow who was a Nazi too, his name was Tuckawitz, T-U-C-K-A-W-I-T-Z, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tuckawitz</span> , told about the approaching, German, German, action, I guess the Jews...Now this Tuckawitz, by the way, was a member of the German Nazi party, an early member of the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Best was much earlier, Best was one of the evil spirits of the police department of the emerging Nazi party even before the two powers divides(ph) into three. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Really, really a war criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He was not ever condemned to death, he should have been, for the reason that he let the secret slip and this was used by his defense to protect him against a life sentence after, death sentence after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But Tuckawitz was kind of a reformed Nazi and he became close, he was a neighbor, commercial, commercial. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He had been with Camaris the head of the German intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Camaris, C-A-M-A-R-I-S who is by the way execute(ph) by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He had been with him at this job at the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> and was to prepare the German occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But he remained here and established very close contact with the leaderships of the socialcratic party and became embarked with them and started to distancing himself from the Nazi ideology. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Of course especially the anti-Jewish part of it and that when Best tipped him off saying that this day the of the Jews will take place and Best is quoted by Tuckawitz by the way, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">In racial talk or what German to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Tuckawitz quoted Best as saying, "I wish we could build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the south between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to aid these poor people to get safely away." </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We never, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motive for his having to invent it, but there's no third witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You only have his word for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because he loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his year fighting Jews, killing Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But his didn't find that it was in his best interests that particular moment of history where everything was going against the German, the German arms, after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">After the collapse of the German, the German military that fought in the Stantengard(ph) in <span class="REGION">Eastern Russia</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was not for his, in his interests that this anti-Jewish action should secede, that's why he told it to Tuckawitz who immediately informed the German, the Danish social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately went to the head of the Jewish community, a very respectable and respective lawyer of the <span class="BUILDING">high court</span> called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous Jewish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And they went to him and told him, okay, now you better prepare for something because there are only a couple of days left. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And it's very interesting, it has to be remembered because part of the Disney Land atmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews all over, all around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">From <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and all through the continent and we thought that we would go Scot-free and didn't prepare for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The Jewish community and leadership didn't even destroy the index of names and addresses of the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The Germans came one day and confiscated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Still this was not enough for us, so start moving, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And this guy in and the Danish political(ph) leaders, to want him(ph), they said, Mr. Hedtoft, H-E-D-T-O-F-T, Mr. Hedtoft, later became the prime minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He said, you are lying, he said well Hedtoft told him that he had a good source and that the game was up. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">You are lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And Hedtoft almost broke out in tears because he was facing the war(ph) and the war(ph) didn't respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But they succeeded after a while at making them understand that this was a serious matter and then out went the warning, the telephone chain as they called it, from one Jewish family to another that tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, don't stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because the Germans will come after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Where you go, everybody was on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The community had not prepare any <span class="DLF">escape route</span> or any escape organization, nope, nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  How did your father hear? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  My father, yes, my father heard this from somebody who had called him, who had been to morning prayers in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on September 13th I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, we went on acting as if life was normal, you know, and as if we were as Danish as the Danes; which to some extent we were, at least in the eyes of the Danes, but not in the eyes of the Germans of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">By the way there was no yellow star, you know, there were no, there were no special legislation introduced by the Germans as regards to the Jewish part of the Danish community, Danish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> early in the morning, maybe at ten o'clock or so, the headmaster came in and he said, "I'm sorry but you and you," he said, "you better come out, I have something to tell you in the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I remember that suddenly we got up from our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> and were following him. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Suddenly he turned around again and he said to the teacher, "you better come with me too." </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The teacher was also a part Jewish and then the fade away(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But you know, at that time, I was fifteen, I was fifteen years old I must have been, you know, retarded because I didn't understand anything at all, because we didn't speak about these things at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  So you weren't afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  I was not afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You know I remember I took the tram(ph) and I went to Keyosk(ph) to buy the weekly magazines as I have done every week and I still remember I came with the weekly magazine sitting under my arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My parents, the <span class="DLF">door</span> was wide , my parents were waiting all dressed up, you know, over coat, why it was winter(ph), October, and said, "hurry up, we have to get away." </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And that's what we got because we... End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Tape 2
QUESTION:  Herbert, I would like to begin by asking you about your family background and when your parents or grandparents came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Well, as a matter of fact I am the first generation born in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My father's side the family came just after the turn of the century from <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Romney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Which is quite a famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in Jewish history because a guy named Toebetor, who became a hero in the Palestine fighting(ph) with the Arab's(ph) back in the 20's came from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Another guy called Rotenbeck(ph) who made the first project for electrification(ph) of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My, , the first group of chim(ph) agricultural pioneers came from the same small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Romney</span> and they settled at the canya(ph) and they formed the first . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Now my grandfather was what they call a kabaducmaha(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That means a...do you know what that is? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Well, he made hats, caps. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And he told me when I was a young man and I asked him why did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Romney</span> , why did you run away from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He said that there was a in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Romney</span> around 1903 or 4, there was a whole empetamy(ph) of good programs at that time the collection(ph) with the defeat of Russians to the Russian-Japanese war. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Romney</span> was a little influential <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where half of the population was Jewish, many of them were artisans, as my grandfather and he and a number of friends lived in a square, farm-like <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And he told me that just before the pulcrum(ph) erupted a Russian officer came to him and he was from the Cossack brigade and told him that you come with him and take his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And you know at that time you didn't ask why when an officer told you, so he took the family and they walked to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the officer and he said you stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And just right after the pulcrum(ph) erupted many Jews were killed some of the work staff(ph) in this farm-like <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where my grandfather had his works were burned and after the pulcrum the officer took my grandfather back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and on the way he asked him, "why did you save me and my family?" </span><span class="sentence" id="149">and the officer said, "well Jew, that's because you make such wonderful hats for my soldiers." </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And my grandfather who hadn't finished any main(ph) <span class="BUILDING">university</span> or any higher education he just knew that to survive that if the future of his family was dependent on his hats fit square with the soldiers heads then he better get out as quick as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So the pack(ph) that was left and of course they were on their way to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , like most Jews, millions of Jews during these years went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Being poor people the money quickly was spent when the in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they had no more money to pay for their passage across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So they made up their mind to go to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Why <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , because my grandmother had a brother who had immigrated earlier to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and he had sent some postcards saying that it was not a bad <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So the thoughts in their heads were let's go where the money reached, the money took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gomain(ph</span> ), that was, as I said around 1905 or 6 or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And they settled down in one of the poorest quarters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , which today of course is Bohem(ph) quarter and were renovated(ph) <span class="BUILDING">slum houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was, but they went there because it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish district</span> and they could meet people which spoke their language, which was not Russian it was Yettish, they were not Russian speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they could somehow repeat and rebuild to some extent the medium(ph) in which they had lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  A religious ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, that's what I want to add. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Another reason why they went their was that it was not far away, within walking distance from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">For them the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was the center in their lives, both the religious life and the sacred(ph) life they lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Which <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Well it was, it was the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which belonged to the Uta(ph) orthodox and the community which was built around that time. , </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It was not at that time as far as my grandfather goes, the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which had the kind of modernistic service, although it's conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He looked for his people and they were at this small <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Of course, the , my father's generation they left the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and joined the large, more modern <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But this was kind of an intimate relationship with religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">By the way this relationship with religion didn't last for long because my grandfather of course was very religious, he was also a small bearded fellow, my father didn't of course, he shaved and he was observant but not orthodox and the third generation intermarried and in a few cases were not Jews or became non-observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But still of course were some hang(ph) for tradition, you know, they speak about two kinds of Jews: they speak about Balkhudan(ph); means Jews whose sits in the stomach, gives Jews and the other group is called; alkhudan, which means that they are also Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But at any rate, so they settled there, and of course at that time they were three children, one of them that immigrated was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He was at that time he was maybe 5, 6, 7 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They were immediately sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And here starts the immediate integration into Danish society because of this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was formed by a Jew of Danish origin who saw that these immigrants who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at the turn of the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They had to become Danes quickly, he didn't mind if they would stay Jewish as far as religious observances, but he wanted them integrate us as quickly as possible into the Danish social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Simply in order to protect the community that was there from rotten shoulders cold(ph) religionist who sort of say would be looked at with hostility from the Danish environment because they were unobservant. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So this was a great lack of the Danish-Jewish community that they would provide services that would immediately channel them into the Danish society. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Learning language, getting ready for Danish career.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Did your grandfather continue as a hat maker?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  He continued, sure he continued as a hat maker and my father when he was at the age of 9, 10 years old when he came back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , everyday he would have to take a case with hats, 6 penses, you know, and go in the harbor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">At that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> was very, very dynamic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">harbor town</span> , which it is not today, and to sell six penses to the sailors and to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , port workers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">From that time my father had a deep feeling of gratitude to the Danish working class. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Which put a little attitude so that he, although it became what you would call industrially started capitalism, he went on continued voting for social democrats because as he always told me, these people, you can match a little Yettish speaking boy looking strange with this Danish were Danish of course, but two or three years in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , walking around the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> with a box of 6 penses trying to peddle them to the Danish workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">He could feel rejected by them and the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so he had a very, since then, he so to say P [person's name] admired the Jews to politics and he became very, very generous as a donor for all kinds of Jewish and non-Jewish causes because he felt that he owed these people something. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">By the way, jumping out a bit, but when they later built a very large and modern <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> he was one of the first Danish industrialists to attend to the needs of the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Providing for instance, <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> for the workers who couldn't leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the public service and a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> one of the best, beautiful canteens facing a <span class="DLF">garden</span> so that they could relax. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He was, he didn't know that he was progressive, but he acted in a very progressive way out of purely sentimental reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">At any rate, so they settled here, and of course I'm not telling you anything that you don't know, because it's sort of kind of a replica of what happened to many Jews who came to the east coast of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as immigrants from the same areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">That they put learning very high because they knew, for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Learning was part of the Jewish tradition, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The religious tradition, where all, all children quickly at the age of 3 or 4 years went to Torah(ph) school and learned to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Read Hebrew letters, so of course this was pretty converted also so the desire to learn other things, other written languages but Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That was one thing, the respect for the book and the respect for the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And secondly of course we learned that if you want to kind of upward mobility in society, you had to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So my father couldn't afford it because he was the eldest so he had to go out and help the parents make a living, so the others could afford to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But the second boy in the family became an engineer and living great desires. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he became one of the very first immigrant boys who graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So very quickly they started moving into society. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Then of course came the first World War, 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="200"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was, as you know, a neutral country and there was kind of an economic boom, prosperity in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> because it was neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Of course it exploited the possibilities it had by supplying the warring(ph) states with what they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">There was Danish military mobilization to protect the neutrality of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and of course these soldiers they needed hats and they needed uniforms and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And the Jewish didn't know anything about a 7 or 8 day work week, you know, a 7 or 8 hour work week. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They worked as much, as long as they needed to provide, to supply those that gave them to consignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They started establishing themselves and moving from this very poor <span class="DLF">street</span> to this <span class="DLF">street</span> in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> which was a little bit less poorer, and I have a list at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which one of my uncles made where he noted all of the addresses within the first couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was tremendous, this was kind of migrant population. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">they had more money, they got another child, they moved into a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> with a half <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> more, <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> more, that's how they slowly, slowly progressed and moved into more <span class="INT_SPACE">boudoir quarters</span> and became, as a matter of fact part of the Danish middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Within probably the early 30's they had become middle class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  Living separately in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> within the Danish middle class?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  No, no, when the moment they moved out of the poor quarter, of course they moved into the middle, they used the Danish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I wouldn't say that they had lots of social contact with them of course, because still their religion and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was, so to say, the axis of their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But of course, there were 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, there were 8 children and of course the children reached out towards Danish society. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">You probably had the same effect that you have today, many Danish girls attempted to strike up relationships with types from the Mediterranean and these were not Mediterranean's, but they were exotic at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> at that time was a very, very homogenous society and when these young Jews came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , they were attractive and exotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">By the way many of them married non-Jewish, already(ph) in the first generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  And how did your grandfather react to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  You know, you know what happens, I don't know if this is pattern, but anyhow in my experience is that there are several phases. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">One of the phases, one is a phase of shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The second is the phase of slowly adapting but not reestablishing contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The third phase is when the first child is born and then the whole bloody thing breaks down, you know you can't, then relations are reestablished and everybody's is happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But at any rate, I just want to go back for one moment to this Romney, I tried to visit it during the communist times before Gorbachev and before the break down of the soviet system. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I went with a friend, a Russian speaking friend, and we went to Kiev(ph) and we asked if anybody would take us to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> which is about 150 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Romney</span> and everybody shied away and said, no you need a special permit, this is a closed <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So we found a very unhappy driver, unhappy because he was deeply indebt for playing some kind of, I don't know, hasard(ph) or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">One of his other friends, and couldn't pay his debt to the people who he owed money, they were people, very strong armed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">One of his friends had to explain to us, we should jump out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> because was jumping himself or being thrown out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , so he wanted to make money. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">You know, at any costs, so he decided that it was worth to run the risk and take us without permission to Romney and during the trip he turned to us and said, this friend of yours who speaks perfect Russian, they're Danish Jew, by the way, but born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , he was a corespondent of the Danish state journalist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">He said that this guy is from the KGB, so we said why should he be from the KGB? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Well, he speaks such perfect Russian, he's just posing as a Danish journalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But after just a few miles, the guy turns around and he said to us, "gee" he said, "I'm sorry, I made a mistake he's not from the KGB." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And we said, "how do you know by now" and he said, "look out through the <span class="DLF">back window</span> " and we looked out and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> following us, he said, "these are the KGB's." </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And they really followed us all the way from Kiev(ph) about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Baneso(ph</span> ) the sign board spelling Romney, then they jumped at us, they stopped our progress and we had to go out, we had to sign documents and there was investigation and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Later we complained to the Russian foreign minister, of course, didn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I asked one of the Russians to take me, how long to keep this <span class="NPIP">place</span> closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He said, "well as long as you want to visit it, it remains closed." </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There must have been some military reasons, reasons for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Anyhow, now of course, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I wanted to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Maybe because of family, maybe because of <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , maybe because of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I just wanted, for several reasons, to see the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my father had been born. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But now, of course, everybody can go there, but now I'm not very attracted by it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It was the prohibition that was attractive apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But anyhow, from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , originally the first group that formed the first collective settlement keboots(ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, later <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">That was around 1908, or something of that close, maybe 1909. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But I asked my grandfather, why didn't you join them, you were the same age group and you had to leave your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> anyhow? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Why did you have to take this long route around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and what not, just for me 50 odd years afterwards to have to rise and go to Zion(ph), you know, all the troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We could have landed there earlier, be part of the aristocracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So he said, "are you crazy," I would never have guessed this, he said, "do you think that I would have joined a gang where the Tracy Malicker(ph)," it's a Yettish, it's a Yettish derivation of Melcher(ph) which is a female name in Hebrew, "the Tracy Malicker, should I join these barefoot people, you know, they walk around barefoot." </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It's true, that the first you know, that they called them the "ball fees(ph)," the barefeet, because they were poor and they made an issue about being puretanic(ph) and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Well anyhow I decided that, well, they were crazy we all could see that they were crazy, we all could see that they were crazy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I decided that I wanted to find out what this crazy Malicker(ph) had been doing and I called the keeboots(ph) and they found out that this crazy Malicker(ph) who my grandfather didn't want to join, she became one of the most prominent educators in the Palestine Zionist(ph) Keeboots(ph) movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But anyhow, to jump ahead, we, my grandfather, became retired and my father started working at the Petlier(ph), the famous 7 , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They only went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for 7 years at that time and he became a statesman(ph)[possibly "salesman" and he passed the career which, you know, the marriage of Jewish immigrants, he started as an employee, as a statesman, he became independent(ph) statesman and by the year, he was traveling very much in <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else that the I have been living commuting between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for thirty years 1s part of the inheritance from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Every Sunday I met my dad, we wished him well, and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and either went to Days(ph) Provinces, or he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">He came back Friday went to the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> in the evening, had to, back at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and on Sunday off they went again. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">In the mean time, he got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">My mother's family came originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , when she was a couple of years old they settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litic(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I'm sure I inherited some of the adventurous spirit of that part of the family because my grandfather, my great-grandfather...
QUESTION:  On your mother's side.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  In the late ages they immigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and came back and settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litic(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He called his family from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litic(ph</span> ), Litic(ph) is in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They became American citizens because he was naturalized as an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I still have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a fantastic picture where you see the old man all dressed up, you know, on the day that he became an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">That must have been a glorious day in his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Anyhow, from that moment the family was American. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They were American citizens, but residing in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Now when the war started, the first World War, they of course, as American citizens, had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , go to a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And they stayed throughout the war years in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And they had a couple of beautiful daughters and they were very respected in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And after the war they returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litic(ph</span> ), but they left the kind of impression on the Danish community here. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So when my father came of age and was supposed to find a wife to settle down, some people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> "well, ===~———~—~—~—_—s a very nice family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litic(ph</span> ) and they had two beautiful daughters, go and take a look." </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So my father went, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litic(ph</span> ), and that must have been 1925 or 6 and they married and my mother joined, of course, my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And that is how, how a nuclear family so to say, came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">One from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , one from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , by <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and Litic(ph) and they settled down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I was born in 1927. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">This is more or less the origin of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">In 1933 they left the rest of the family, my grandparents and left Litic(ph) and they immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where some of their boys already had gotten, became very American patriotic, you know they served, the boys, in the second World War, the army, the navy and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Very Americanized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  What was your mother's family's name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Originally it was Takletaub(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It's not an unusual Jewish name, Takletaub(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Takletaub(ph) is the name of a certain kind of a dove, pigeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But they abbreviated "tove" to "taub," t-a-u-b. This was more, I just want to say one funny thing about my grandfather on my mother's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He was very, very strict and stubborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He's remembered as a disciplinary in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">One of these autocratic, patriotic types, who could never do wrong, and if he ever did do wrong, he could never admit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">My mother told me one particular case, he was supposed to go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in Europe from Litic (ph) the family took him to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they waved at him good-bye and he sat down and they were very , they were very unemotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So they never stood in the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waving good-bye, they simply, when they put out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and took out the newspaper they could on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , you know, looking at the family patriarch leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But what happened that day was, he went onto the wrong <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and instead of going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and he could never admit it because had he changed in the meantime, you know, half way, then of course it would be ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So from that moment he pretended that as a matter of fact he was supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> while the people were waiting for him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So, anyhow, so they settled and they got, my parents, got three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Besides me, my brother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">My brother was killed by an accident in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">My sister immigrated, 7 years we immigrated in 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">To Israel(ph) where she married and lives today, has three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That is more or less as far as I remember the relative background...

ANSWER:  Anyhow, I remember when we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> out to hide with a friend of my father's, a business friend, of course, non-Jewish couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And I was later told by my mother, years after that the driver of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> refused to take money for the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">At that time this was the first sign of some kind of, say, popular resistance coming to the aid of the Danes. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">You know, people were warned by neighbors, by Jewish families to just leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But there were moving details, you know, some Jews who took hiding into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because they had no where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">There was a <span class="DLF">botanical garden</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> just across from one of the large <span class="BUILDING">municipal hospital</span> and the doctors and nurses during the day went out and searched for Jews hiding in the <span class="DLF">botanical garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">People who didn't have business friends who they could turn to. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I remember, one of my, a friend of mine later at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> who became a member of parliament for the social democratic party, his father was head of the social democratic party organization in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and he simply recruited his son and a few other youngsters and he told them to go through each and every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , look at the name cards and when they see something that could be Jewish, warn them and tell them to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">At that time, already, lots of individual initiatives were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">There was no coordinating rule for organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But the moment the people, non- Jews realized that the Jews were in danger, than all kinds of initiatives were taken by individuals, by groups of people, by priests, by <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So, this particular case, whenever they met a Jewish family, there were many Jewish families in this <span class="REGION">area</span> here, especially poorer Jewish families because it was at that time before the war restrictive, not so, no quality <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , I would say to put it mildly. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So they had been told, if you find a Jewish couple, tell them immediately to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and go to Bespepyau(ph), <span class="BUILDING">Bespepyau Hospital</span> , where they would be offered hospitality and put into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">One <span class="NPIP">place</span> he found another friend student of his a student, a fellow of his and they said, well it can't be, you know, that's how the Jewish reaction was to the unintelligible. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Of course, it must be against nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And again he told me years later that it broke him to weeping, simply because...so then the father, the father said, you're my friends, you're my sons friends and if you say, we believe it and then to the car(ph) and went out to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">In one case he told me that he found an old, old lady and took her to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and suddenly she got a fit of hysterics...

QUESTION:  ...sensitivity
ANSWER:  sensitivity or empathy with the people who...anyway that's the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The story is that night we stayed with our friends, we couldn't stay more than one night at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> because, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now we know in retrospect that the Germans acted totally different than they acted in other <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But we had to prepare for the worst, so we had to make all kinds of decisions because we believed that this was a serious matter for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Now we know that they were all common interest in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camp</span> which enabled us to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , but it's quite obvious that half the Germans acted with the same will power. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">The same, the same organizational talent which they used in prosecuting, persecuting Jews in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Of course they would have caught us, but we didn't know so we had to act as if...by the way this is also true for the Danes. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">After the war there was the inclination to say, well anyhow the Danes are not such great heroes, but the of the Danes were caught, those few that were caught got two or three weeks of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> by the Danish authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">You know, we still had <span class="BUILDING">Danish courts</span> , we didn't have <span class="BUILDING">German courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Looking at most of the Jews, only 500 were arrested, the rest were . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It's true that the conditions were in our favor and in the favor of the Danes who helped us to rescue. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But one has to go back and look at the situation as it were in as far as we could know and all the Danes who came to our help. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They had no reason to believe that they did not risk their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and anybody hiding a Jew was stood up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So I really think that this was a very heroic chapter in Danish history. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But we thousands of things, well, could believe that they were ready to risk their lives and save the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The fact that they didn't(ph) do it comes, that we learn after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But this doesn't change the fact that they were justified believing that they acted as heroes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  But the Germans did capture some, didn't they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  They captured about 5 hundred and about 6,500 came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Now in our case, we shifted from the first <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">We went down the <span class="DLF">coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">This was like animals do looking for <span class="DLF">escape routes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">You go by the smell, you know, and you go by instinct you went down to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> because the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> that you could hide, along the <span class="DLF">coast</span> and hope to be able to get to the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> that might receive you and protect you was <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And the sound(ph) between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> is not very wide, but it recovered by the distance from the <span class="REGION">Danish coast</span> to <span class="REGION">Sweden territory</span> water could be covered by a quick <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in less than half an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But it was beyond our imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">There lies <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> which is hidden in the darkness and just across this narrow sound was neutral Sweden with lights and with chocolate and bananas and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But began to realize that there were people who were able to live another kind of life that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But we went down to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> hoping that we could escape this way of course and hapbeny(ph), the Swedish government who had, by the way, not been welcoming to Romney refugees in 42's and early 43 issued a declaration during these H days welcoming all Jews saying that they could come to Swedish protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">The fact is that the Swedish not only made statements to that effect, but they also acted accordingly because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish patrol boats</span> from the navy went out took the Swedish to the <span class="DLF">borderline</span> and the moment that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Danish boats</span> crossed this <span class="DLF">borderline</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish boats</span> immediately came to protect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So that in case that Germans, I mean, you had to account for all . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">In case a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German patrol boat</span> would try to encroach on <span class="REGION">Swedish waters</span> to catch a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fleeing refugee boat</span> the Swedes would simply intervene. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But anyhow we went to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> ...
QUESTION:  Wait, where on the <span class="DLF">coast</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  It was a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sletten</span> , S-L-E-double T-E-N, which is not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I mean very close, it's fishing, to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> of Catipriod(ph) called <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Then we went to the fisherman with whom we had stayed for years during our summer vacation, plus it was a rule that they sublet the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , then they move into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> , during these two months of summer vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And of course he knew us well and he offered us hospitality that we could have wanted because he didn't use a telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We believed that this was real, this was for real, you didn't use a telephone, you didn't speak to any strangers, you're afraid of moving on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> because you were afraid of ending up in the arms of German patrol, there were Germans all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , soldiers mainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Only later we know that the army decided not to interfere, not to take part in the acts against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So the German army for its own reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews, wanted to protect the Jews, but simply for its own interests the German army only had one case that's known to have participated in this anti- Jewish action. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">This was left to the police and the, what do you call it, the visheyesteins(ph), the what the German counter intelligence, whatever it is the, Estit(ph), it's called Estit(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So the very fact that the army was all around didn't interfere. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">This we couldn't have known either. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So we took hiding at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and one night he had negotiated with another fisherman to take us across to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We were told that late at night to move across the <span class="DLF">coastal road</span> and go down to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and wait under a small <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to be picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We were standing there freezing, my parents, my father, my mother and my three sisters and brother and we heard the doc(ph), doc(ph), doc, doc [sound of approaching <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ], of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> approaching the <span class="DLF">docks</span> of course the lights are on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I mean today we're sitting in a <span class="INT_SPACE">warm room</span> , this thing 50 years behind us, it's difficult to imagine a family all on its own alone, without any protection standing on a small <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span> looking into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> waiting for the doc, doc, doc, doc to come to pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But anyhow, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> appears from the darkness and we are all already to jump at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it simply passed by and it went to a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> where another Jewish family was waiting and picked them up and off it went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Of course we never learned what the reason was, maybe these people could have paid them more money, maybe it was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I don't know, but we were standing out there in the darkness without any alternative. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So we returned to the fisherman and we really did not, my father was responsible for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">These were times when the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know what to do, we all relied on the fisherman getting some kind of connection which we could use in order to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Another night we spent at a large white <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with lots of other refugees sitting in the dark <span class="INT_SPACE">sitting room</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and the specification, the student organization, while rowing us over, rowing, can you imagine, maybe <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for 2 or 3 people in these heavy wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> which they were taking from the fisherman, loaned from the fishermen rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And I remember that when our turn came, the guy who was supposed to row us over, this would take hours, I mean you could go by quick <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> for 30 minutes, but to be rowed over by one man that was very heavy(ph) going, two hours, and going for more than one trip was very difficult, but these were in the days that when the crisis was really on these were the nice ones that knew that the Jewish were looking for us...
QUESTION:  ...the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  The Germans, sorry, the Germans were looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">People got scared, the Germans were looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And suddenly the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened, I remember this vividly because you are on the edge, you're on the way of getting out of this horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Then the guy, the student, who was supposed to take us came in and we saw that blood was running down his palms and he said to my parents so we had to go back to . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Then the next day, suddenly the door bell rings, we of course are like mice scurrying around hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I remember one of my brother hide a my father had hidden under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">A very undignified situation today, it's very hard to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You know, that parents at that time were, had different stature(ph) then they do today. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">For instance, in our <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">father's chair</span> and nobody would ever dream of sitting in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">father's chair</span> even if he was away. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Another thing that I remember so vividly is some very painful memory is that when we finally got on our way and found a reliable <span class="DLF">escape route</span> it was the day after. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We run through a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> at night, single file of course, the father in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Suddenly my father slipped on a <span class="DLF">route</span> or a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branch</span> and fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">This was the fall of, this was the fall, suddenly seeing your father in this, he was always in control, the provider, the protector, suddenly seeing him in a situation with this falling you know at the time when the whole family was relying on him, you know, this is something which still today can give me the creeps. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But at any rate, the <span class="DLF">door</span> bell rang and the fisherman went out to answer the <span class="DLF">door</span> , because in those days if you didn't open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , they would break in. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">At any rate, if you didn't open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , as I said, they would break them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So he went out and opening the <span class="DLF">door</span> and a voice asked, as we heard from <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , "is the family Pundik here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Of course

class="DLF">doors</span> available asking the same question, "have you seen the Pundik family?" </span><span class="sentence" id="433">He couldn't know if we had escaped already, but he simply, you know, that is the way that people had to act it was a moral imperative for them to act, so he did this impossible thing and found a needle in the haystack. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">He went along the <span class="DLF">coast</span> asking, he knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> where we were and happily my father recognized the voice and said that I'll come get you tonight when it is dark in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">doctor's car</span> , in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">physician's car</span> was permitted by the Germans to move around freely came and picked us up and took us to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">A <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ultzgolden(ph</span> ) which is about 15 kilometer north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsenor(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="436">He lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> facing the <span class="DLF">coastal

<span class="DLF">coast</span> and we were rowed out to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> and I remember two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I remember that I turned around and had a last look at <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> were kneeling with their hands raised in a kind of praying position were the fisherman's wife and the follow who had saved us, my father's business friend and his wife, they were believing(ph) people, praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Another thing that I remember was maybe only that time I showed a knack for journalism, I looked at my watch the moment the motor started operating and we were heading for Swedish territory waters and I remember that it took us exactly 37 minutes to go from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> into safety to <span class="REGION">Swedish territory</span> water. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But some people, I want to conclude
