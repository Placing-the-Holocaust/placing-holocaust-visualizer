<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  We are interviewing Mrs. Polak about her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Let’s start with your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Would you tell me your father’s full name and his date of birth and where he was born, and anything you might know about his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My father’s name was Abraham Soep, the Dutch word for soup, which was not a nice name to go out with as a child, as you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">He was born on April 17, 1892.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Anything else? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Do you know anything about his childhood, about his family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  I don’t know too much about his childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I know that his mother was very young when she married. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">His father started a <span class="BUILDING">diamond factory</span> which was built, I guess with money from his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Before that as far as I know, they were cigar makers. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They were out of poor Ashkenazi background. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But the <span class="BUILDING">diamond factory</span> was a success and they became well to do later. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My grandmother I remember very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">She was a very wise person but very uneducated. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">She had an inner wisdom but she didn’t know much about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My grandfather died when I was four so I don’t remember him too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I think he was quite a bit more intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My father was the oldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He was born ten years after his parents were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They couldn’t have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They adopted or took in a niece, a sister of my grandfather had one child after the other and did not know how to take care of them, so they took one of those children as a child, who I consider my aunt and my father who was born after ten years of marriage after the adoption, considered her his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">She was quite a bit older. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Then they had four other children who all died before age one for different reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">One had diphtheria, another was dropped by somebody else and horrible stories that never really was talked about because in those days a lot of people lost a lot of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And then my uncle was born who was ten years younger than my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">His name was Hans Soep and he was a very sickly child. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They thought they were going to lose him, but they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Where my father was this tall, broad heavy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My uncle was the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He was small and very small boned and small build. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">They got along well. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My uncle looked up to my father a lot and really was always a little bit in the shadow. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He went into business, after schooling he went into business with my father, as a partner, or a junior partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father had three years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which at that time was really quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was an official three-year course high school and after he finished he went into business with his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">His father died at the age of 64 and his mother died in the beginning of the war in 1942, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">What else do you want to know about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  I think we have most of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">A My mother was from a family of six children. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She was born on December 8, 1895, her name is Toni Fredrika Kauffman was her maiden name. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Everybody called her Toni. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She came from a very liberal family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My father came from an orthodox family, but when he married my father, she became a dutiful kosher housewife and later on took an interest in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">She took Hebrew lessons conversation lessons to learn the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Her parents were German but they had moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in the 1880’s and the six children were all born in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The oldest one, I think, in ’87, and there was a span of twenty years between the oldest and the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">One of my aunts is still alive and lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the youngest one who 1s going to be 85 1n May. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And we are all going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , all the nieces and nephews that are still there for a reunion.. She was a dutiful housewife, it was a very good marriage, but my father was a very dominant person, not of many words but his whole being was a little authoritarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But my mother was perfectly happy in her role and not until after he died, which was in 1953, and she lived until 1980, not until a few years after he died did she become her own person and showed a lot more personality and initiative and everything than I had ever seen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We were on very good terms all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  How was she as a mother when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Well, when we were growing up she was, you know, like a mother should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Very nurturing, but we lived in a fairly big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we had two maids and one of them was more or less what they call a “kinder fraulein.” </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They all came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They took care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And there was a cleaning woman and there was a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There were a lot of people to take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My father traveled a lot because in the diamond business he went every other week to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Once a month to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He was on lots of committees, so my mother was often alone with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But she was kind of a, she doesn’t stand out in my mind as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I always used to say as a child, I’m not being brought up I’m just growing up by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I felt kind of independent, I guess, from my young years on. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But not realizing it I probably wasn’t, but 1t seemed that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But she was very sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Everybody loved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">She was a real lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">She looked like a lady, and she was cultured. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">She came from a cultured background than my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">She was fond of music, she played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> quite nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">She spoke beautifully French. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My father took an interest later in music and became very musically inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I think he played the violin when he was a young boy so there must have been something there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They traveled quite a bit without us, which we resented when we were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">When we used to complain, my mother used to say in a German expression which her mother used to say to her, you just travel with your own husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That’s about all I can say about my mother from the early years. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">About my sister, she 1s still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  In that case, I need to talk to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Do it yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">She has lots and lots of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I don’t think they relate to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She’s been a problem her whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">She doesn’t have a very happy present life. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">She lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She’s a very strong, determined person, but it’s lots of problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Can we go on a talk about these two friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Yes, let’s talk about these two friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One of them Rudi Acohen who was really my boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I met him when he was 13 and I was 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We lived next to each other during the summer at the <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Our parents had rented <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  What was the name of that <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zandvoort</span> and it’s very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My father commuted every day from business by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , because the chauffeur came and picked him up and brought him. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That’s what was done in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He also went to <span class="BUILDING">Montessori High School</span> , but a different one from mine, and I remember hearing his name when in June ’35 we went to visit our <span class="BUILDING">Montessori High School</span> for the first time just for orientation and everybody’s name was mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I thought what a strange name this boy has. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And then we went a few weeks later to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zandvoort</span> and who lives next door, the boy with the strange name, and we were very crazy about each other, even when that young, and you know, like children are we played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We played ball, we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dunes</span> , we went swimming and then he was in my class for several years and then he was transferred to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He wasn’t entirely a good student and couldn’t stay in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But I stayed very friendly with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Actually ‘til he was arrested also in a raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Again a reprisal raid in July ’42, just before the deportation started. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Also a German soldier had been killed and they emptied that whole <span class="DLF">street</span> of all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">One very long <span class="DLF">street</span> , very nice <span class="DLF">residential street</span> , went in every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where there were Jews and arrested them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Do you know what year Rudi was born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">His birthday was June 4, and he was born in 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Did he have any other interests, did he have musical interests?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He also played tennis and he played the violin, he had violin lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He liked popular music, records.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Do you remember any in particular, or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Well, we listened a lot to French songs, like Charles Trunet (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You probably don’t even know that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He was very popular then, and also Austrian songs like Marta Keller, I think that was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">No, that was not her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We listened to American songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Frank Sinatra was big. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We played a lot of classical records. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We had an old fashioned player. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">For his Bar Mitzvah he got a record player, you know, that you turned a handle to play, and we played a lot of classical music. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">What else? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We did what young people do. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We went on trips, bike trips and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He was caught in one of those raids and that was the end of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The day after he was arrested, he was sent on o <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I never heard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">With his parents and his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I even went in a day or two after because I worked for the Jewish Council in that department that was called Aids to Departing People and I was able to send some stuff to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> because most people stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But later on I heard they weren’t even there. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And, of course, he never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I didn’t know that at the time during all those years, all of the sudden he might be back. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He was young and everything, of course we realized that he probably didn’t live three days afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  What month was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  It was June 1942 and it was just after his birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I am trying to look back, his birthday was on June 4, 1942 and whatever the Sunday was after that; I think it was June 9"", it was that date. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He had just turned 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He had a younger brother who was very, very bright and very, very musical, was about three or four years younger than him. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Of course, he went, his parents, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And then, after that I had some sort of a boyfriend, his name was Hans Rudelshim, and he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kampen</span> , which was near , . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I don’t know when his birthday was. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He went into hiding a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">His father was a tailor, and he was a good tailor too. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">AS a matter of fact he remodeled some sports clothes of my father for my sister and me into skirts and little top and he was also a very gifted pianist and he took some piano lessons from a blind Hungarian pianist who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Was also caught in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and who used to practice when he couldn’t play concerts anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He used to give house concerts of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and he practiced at my parents’ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We had a grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he got to know this friend of mine and he taught and gave him lessons
QUESTION:  Do you know what year Hans was born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  I think probably also in 1922, it may have been ’21. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He may have been a year older, and he had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kampen</span> , like all the people from the Provinces were sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He looked very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He dyed his hair blond and went into hiding and did all kinds of reckless things, traveled and went everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And, of course, they were betrayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Do you know when that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  I don’t know exactly when that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We were still in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we left there in May ’43, so it must have been February or March ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I don’t know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Never heard a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He was sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And then this other picture here is of a young man named Gideon, we called him in Dutch, it’s called “Chideon’”’, and we called him “Chi.” </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He was from a very prominent Dutch gentile family. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They were originally Huguenots, therefore the French name. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We were very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We were in the same grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">He was a very good friend of my boyfriend, Rudi . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">In the very beginning I hear of the Dutch National Socialist Movement in the early ‘30’s, a lot of people became members of this Nazi group. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Even Jews, because they thought, you know, it was a good system and very orderly and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Before we knew all the stuff that was going to happen, but his family eventually, of course, totally abandoned this and they were very, very good and had many Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He went into the Resistance and hid Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">His father was sent away and died in, I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , one of the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">His mother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> , survived, came back a wreck and lived for quite a few years as a wreck, and never really got over all of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Can you tell us anything about either Gideon or Hans, or both, and Rudi, what were they like? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">What was their personalities like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Well, you know when you grow up together as children you don’t delve that much in the personalities or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He was just also not the greatest of students, but a very sweet guy and fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We had a lot of fun together. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We were young, we had parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We organized our own parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We decided whether we would go formal to this party or should we go another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Everybody brought their best records and we played and we danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We had very happy teenage years. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was mostly for fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Although I do remember though once we were in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that we had very deep conversation subject about the incarnation or vivisection, you know, experiments on animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Who was for and who was against. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You know, like teenagers who go to a decent <span class="BUILDING">school</span> do. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But it was mostly just friends together all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I spent really all my years in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with my friends rather than with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We did our homework, but it had to be done quick because then we would get together and play records and talk and have fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Of course girls were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He had a girlfriend too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Hans, how did he fit in with the circle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  No, Hans really didn’t move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> until the war was already on, and his uncle was a physician in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and they were the best friends of Rudi’s parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So I knew him really through Rudi. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And then Rudi was deported, you know, he went after me, because he liked me from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So somehow that’s how all these people fit in. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I mean these are just three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I showed you a little tennis picture, there were several more we were always together with. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">These were really after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudi</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Rudi was a very nice down to earth, rather simple kind of guy, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">You don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I sometimes wonder what would he have been or become. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He was as I said he didn’t have very good head for learning, but his father was a stockbroker and I think he could have become that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He was interested in business and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But there wasn’t much time for development yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">You know, we were both 16 when the war broke out in Europe and 17 when <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We were kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I mean even today 16 and 17 years old, and they are much more sophisticated than we were, but even they are little kids, while they know more of what goes on in the world, you know, with television. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We didn’t have television, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We didn’t have a radio in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until I was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">If I wanted to hear children’s programs on the radio, I walked 25 minutes to my grandmother’s every Tuesday afternoon to hear children’s programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We were not really spoiled kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It wasn’t that much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Is there anything else? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I know I’ve picked your brain and put you through the wringer. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  There’s probably a million things I can add, you have to stop somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  Thank you very, very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  You’re very welcome. </span>
