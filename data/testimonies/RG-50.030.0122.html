<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Of my childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well...uh...I can tell you very nice things. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My childhood in my early, early years...uh...probably the best years in my life because there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My father was...uh... a director in...at...at a very nice <span class="BUILDING">textile company</span> which...textile company which everybody knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , _____Goldberg was the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He was working there from younger age, and gradually working himself up so he had a very comfortable, nice, pleasant life. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother never worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She was a homemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And my father who was working everyday and I had...I had a little sister who I never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Her name was Clara. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">She... That was the firstborn to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">She died when she was a child...a baby, an infant, 8, 7...7 weeks old. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And then after came my little brother, John, who is Hungarian___ and they called him ___ and he was 16 months older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He was born in 1922, March 14th. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And then I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Magda. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And very many years after came my little brother, George, who was born in 1936, April 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So we were the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Of course, George doesn't remember my early childhood because I was a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I was 12 years old when he was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We had a...a very.. How shall I say it? </span><span class="sentence" id="30">A very comfortable, not luxurious life...I can't say that...but we had a very lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">As a matter of fact, I visited in 1977 first time <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> after I left...from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> with my mother and brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We left in 46, so we went back in 1971. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">That was how many years, 30 some years after...31 years after. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we went back to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was born because I was born in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And so was my little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My little brother, John...my younger, brother George was born already in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But I was terribly upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So upset that I didn't even take my mother in...with her we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rental car</span> that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We went specifically on my mother's request to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She wanted to see the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> once more, so we went in 77. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And we went to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and it was unfriendly, dark and not clean so we didn't go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">When...when I went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> is when I went with my husband, Norman. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">In 1986 I think or 85 we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I wanted to show him. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He has a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So we went and I said to my husband, "I'd really like to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">To the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It was not a private <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And it's lovely <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It's a very well known <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It's called ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And nowadays when we went there with my husband, there are some <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> or delegations in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , in that <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So we lived in that <span class="DLF">street</span> and ____ was another <span class="DLF">street</span> , corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And so when I went there it seemed the same in a way again, but I opened the main <span class="DLF">door</span> and inside it was filthy, and the main <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was either walled in or changed so I couldn't go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It was so disappointing for me and I was so sad that I told my husband, "Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It's no use to look for something.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But in my time, it was a very beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It had four <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and I think had two <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and had a little maid...for the maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had a permanent woman who lived with us for many, many years and then later on changed to other one who also lived with us for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And...uh...we had...and I described this...not in this paper what I left but I made a tape on this actually at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and I lived there really remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I remember the curtains were all with strawberry velvet and in the summertime my mother took it off and changed it for a summer curtains that the sun shouldn't eat it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And we had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">music room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">One of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> was kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">music room</span> because my mother played the piano beautifully and my father played the harp, which is very unusual that the man plays the harp, but he played the harp. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Everybody else in the family, including me, not anymore, including me, we ...we sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We loved to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My mother had a very pretty voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My father had a lovely baritone, so we used to play in that <span class="INT_SPACE">music room</span> and friends of my father came and they sang so we had very lovely memories on the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Hanukkah or Yom Kippur or Pasah, and even Christmas I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We had a wonderful event even on Christmas time. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was a very Catholic country. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Everybody had Christmas trees and all this, so everybody was even holiday feeling in that time, winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And we had...I remember my...the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> ... my mother's and father's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was...was in that time, probably was personal when they got married, was light pink and had all lace and so, the children...my brother and myself, we were In one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , never separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I don't remember when we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And then later my...my brother, my little brother was born and...uh...he...I don't know whether he was in a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But it was a lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We had...in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was...all the heating were with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I don't know what they <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I don't know how they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had a different color. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">One was brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The other one was pink. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So we liked to sit around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And so the regular life was very peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My father worked, and we went to...later on <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I remember only the years from my own life when I went to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And interesting enough I remember that my late brother when to the same <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> a year before I did, and my brother, George, much later...it was already almost war time, he went to that same <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> which was called <span class="BUILDING">Princess Julienne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It was a Dutch Reform private school. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The Dutch Reform Church private school in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and it still 1t exists because I took my husband and showed him and said, "Look, how small it looks and...‚Äù It was beautiful in my time because it was well kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Now it wasn't anymore...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> well kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So I went there to see so after I attended that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my brother, my late brother, after 4 years...we had 4 years <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> , he went to a so-called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They were not called <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> . __ </span><span class="sentence" id="96">or <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He went to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which was very near where we lived. __, </span><span class="sentence" id="98">it's called. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">This is an old famous Hungarian patriot's name, and he went there and he got his Bachelors Degree there after 8 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And I went from that...from the <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> , I went to the Jewish leitsiam, which is...the <span class="DLF">street</span> still exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I don't think that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> existed in <span class="DLF">Albiana Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Maybe it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I didn't look for that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">What I was looking for and surprisingly I didn't find when I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ...I went for...after 4 years in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I went for a year or so...a year to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And then from...from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ...the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , and on the end I ended in the Commercial Academy of Budapest, which is a very beautiful and very important <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I went there for 2 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Actually, I have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ...in back in <span class="REGION">Arizona</span> , my <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> report cards of 4 years and I found some of the report cards from the Jewish leitsiam, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , so-called <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I didn't find anything from the <span class="BUILDING">commercial academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But as a...as a history, I learned that the <span class="BUILDING">Commercial Academy</span> but as a...aS a history I learned at the <span class="BUILDING">Commercial Academy</span> to write <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and geography and mathematics and subjects, accounting and things which was connected to the..uh... <span class="BUILDING">Commercial Academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I didn't find the <span class="BUILDING">Academy</span> at all, and I told my husband that I really have to go back and look for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Why don't I? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So I attended that. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years, if I can say that to you...the <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The primary years, of course, were the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I remember all the little gifts we have gotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I was a very good student in <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> and my late brother, we were always being Jewish students in a...1n a Protestant, because Dutch Reform was...mostly, they were Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It's a reform school, and even we...the Jewish children, we had special religion class everyday in the morning, the Jewish students...the few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we were allowed to go to their <span class="BUILDING">church</span> where they sing all the beautiful psalms, you know, the Protestant Psalms. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we learned that. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And that gave us a very good relationship with the other students. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Unfortunately, I have never ever met anybody when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in 77, anybody at all from my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Probably was a Gentile Christian children went other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The Jewish probably were all most killed, because I didn't see anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So in our life, I speak about, you know, 23, and I got to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was 5 and a half, 20 years, 29, 30, 32, and all the way up to...I would say...I remember the date on 1938, that my father was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> sitting at lunch time. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every day for lunch, and he came every evening <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and...and the good years he had even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I know it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fiat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And we...we didn't travel on that much I know, but when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Balaton</span> for the summer season for the 4 weeks, we traveled on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So...but that doesn't mean that we were wealthy, just because he was in this position in this <span class="BUILDING">textile company</span> which was the largest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , he could afford it I suppose or they gave it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I don't know whether it was his or the company, but we had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And...uh...I just don't know...that day I remember very clearly...I remember that for years, that my father opened the newspaper at lunchtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We were very quiet at lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were not supposed to...not because he was strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He was not as strict...my mother was stricter to us than my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I never even been spanked or anything my father ever in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Never! </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I didn't put this in the paper, but I come to my mind, the only time I remember that my father was...became angry with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">One day when I was a child and he said, "You have to go with me today and with ____, to Grandma," his mother who passed away before the war ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I don't know...I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I said, "No, Father or No, Daddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I don't want to go to the...‚Äù And he came to me and shook my shoulder and said, "Yes, you go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And that was the only violent thing from my father toward me. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My mother, who I adored and all our lives, my younger brother...I think he was a fantastic son and unusual son too because he cared for my mother in last years of her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And my mother, if I said something fresh which we were not supposed to...I remember once that I fought with my older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">My...my younger brother wasn't alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We fought or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And I beat my brother,_Yanshi with from anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And my mother...my brother went to complain to my mother and my mother said, "What did you do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I said, "Well, he said something or he didn't want to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I beat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I said you shouldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">You will be punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And you will be punished now if you continue this.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I was so upset about the punishment, I told my mother, "If you punish me Mother, I commit suicide.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="155">A word from a young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And my mother gave me, "Why did you say that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And I got it on my mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And I cried terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And my mother said, "You have to go into the corner, with your back turn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I just hysterically cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Pardon me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I remember that because____ __‚Äî_ I cried, cried and then she came to me and embraced me and said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">No, more.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And that was the end of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  You were saying that your father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  And my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and I remember that he opened the newspaper and he says, "My God, the Germans occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And that was in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So, 1938...I was born in 23, so I remember that...at the paper he said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And that...that from that day on, really times in a way changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Not much, but in a way, because first of all we lived still in that...1n that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I was born, but I don't know if in 1940 or 41, his salary decreased and something happened in the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He didn't have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> needless to say...anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And in 1941, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ...I remember that very clearly because I was not such a young little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I remember in 1941, they began to take away...the Hungarians, the Jewish men. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Certain young men, certain age. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">1941 or 1942 they began to concentrate these people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Young men and so I remember that...that time already, we had to move out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We moved in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> called which is forget me street. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And I been back on that <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We seen the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with my younger brother and with my mother, and that part is very nice, still very pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Not too far from our original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but not that near, maybe a mile and a half or so, walking distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And we went there because I suppose my father couldn't afford the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We didn't have a maid then there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Our maid who we loved very much went back to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> on that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I remember that well. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And so we moved to this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which is much smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Was very pretty too because I remember that my mother could put her famous curtains and the lace covers. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I don't know whether they just sold it probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , but her own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">She had very beautiful...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">living room furniture</span> was _____ wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So we had a nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And from that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we were then later on taken to the <span class="BUILDING">David Star house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I remember that we had to leave that. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But the...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> changed because they were frightening times. </span><span class="sentence" id="198"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> I think entered already in the war as part of the (clearing throat) Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">1942 I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I am confused with the dates, which you said is not so important for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But I know that in 1942 men were taken away to <span

taken...in that particular time the Hungarian government issued some decrees that certain age, young Jewish men has to go in that...in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> and whichever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> we lived, and so my brother had to go and left in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I seen him once more because in the...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> ...so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , because ___ and that's the exact translation, ___ 1s labor and tava 1s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , where they did...I don't know what work. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Probably... I don't know what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Anyhow, we weren't supposed to visit him, but we had cards for him, post cards which I have along with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And...uh...my brother...uh... we were...we could visit my brother once. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They advised us we come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mohacs</span> is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It's south from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And we went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">My father didn't come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I don't know what reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">That was in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And we visited my brother on...we went on...by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Danube River boat</span> , with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And other families were on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> visiting this part...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">particular camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Probably, it was advertised or was called up on the people on this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> people relatives can come. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I don't know why they done this because when we got there late evening, they were terrible to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The Hungarian guards, they were the so called national guards which in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> called Chander, and these were in special uniform and a hard like a ___ hat with a feather on them...I don't know what can...it's...it's a bird it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was a very special uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They were very frightening people to me even in...in peace time, but they were very rude and they were very bad and they pushed us and so we were very frightened and they hustled some people in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there and I...we didn't go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And just where we had to wait for my brother, and my brother came and we seen my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He was not in a bad shape as I remember his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">He was thinner that time, but he could get packages from my mother and my father for helping through, and that was the last time I seen my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">My father and my brother has another story, of course which is later on...my father, in 43, was still with us all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then came...when the Germans came in 1944, I think 19th of March, was when the Germans entered through the Austrian-Hungarian border to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and immediately was a horrible evening because we know this was the end of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Why we didn't go away from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I have no idea because I had a cousin, my late father's late brother who died also before the war, who immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So I don't know why it didn't come ever to my father's mind to leave and as a matter of fact, 1t didn't because we were brought up...my...my brother, my late brother, and myself on a very patriotic way. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We were Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We were Jewish, but we were at same...same time Hungarian, so we didn't follow...we didn't have this hatred against Hungarians, because we were Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We sang the Hungarian national anthem with the children and we were...my...my late brother was in the boy scouts and went out on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> just like here in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , so we weren't...we weren't educated to..to hate Gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We were educated to love everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Just keep our religion as much as we can and respect our books and our past, but we were never in hatred, so when the Germans came and since I remember that was terrible times to other parts of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">1944, it was...the Germans were occupying half Europe, and the Hungarians were fighting with the Germans...not even fighting, 1t was already a withdrawal. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I think it was...the offensive, the Russian offensive was already a long time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">My father said, "This is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">This will be the end if the...1f the Germans come in.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Because we knew that a lot of Hungarians were very anti-Semitic and we were all...couldn't lead the life as we really wanted to...the peaceful, kind, sweet life. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We were always frightened about something. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When the Germans came in, not very long time after that, they occupied, of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They were these decrees given out to us...to the Jewish people that everybody should leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they had to be in an assigned <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and that's how we went from that particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> from _____ to this <span class="DLF">street</span> which was called ___ <span class="DLF">King Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was not on the...near, but it was again the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I don't know whether you know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> had 12, I think, different <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ___.. So it was a little bit smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">districts</span> were all, I think, in the Seven districts, if remember correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And so we were ordered from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were living to go to this <span class="BUILDING">David Star house</span> , and we couldn't take anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We really didn't take anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Really. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was order given just to...necessary belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">All the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , everything stayed back which we have never found, needless to say, even after the Russian came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Everything was stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Everything was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I only remember things like...like my mother gave out some Persian rugs to some Christian friends because we had...my father was 4 years...in the first World War, he was decorated. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He had a shot 1n his leg and his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Never suffered of it, but I know that he showed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">This was...he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shamisho</span> , I remember...this was a big event in first war, first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And he had friends from first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">His pals or his buddies as we call it, and he kept up with them and he went to military meetings like the people do, so he had Christian friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We had very many Christian friends through my father and...uh...what happened when we went...when we were ordered to go out from this ____ <span class="BUILDING">street building</span> to the other one... Well, we couldn't take anything along. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Only clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I remember that my mother put things in a big basket. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">You know, the old fashioned baskets which you carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And that was all what we have taken to the other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But I remember that my mother gave out some jewelry which she had, necklace and something from her aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I don't remember exactly which...which it was because I was ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I think her diamond earrings were sold already. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Because I know that it was sold because the little container where her earrings were...she had, I still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And how I got it back that's a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That comes later, but I know that...that the basket was filled up with winter clothing and some pots and plans which she needed maybe to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Anyhow on that particular time, this was in 44, frightening things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">As you know, in 1944 March to mid July I suppose or maybe before, all the Hungarian Jews were deported from the <span class="REGION">provincial area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There were no Hungarian Jews alive unless some could escape or could hide or had fake documents or what not, but all the rest of the Hungarian-Jewish population was deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">All of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And...uh...I have to make a comment here, which I put in my paper, which is always in my mind that I have very good friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and 1s a Czech girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And she mentioned to me when I...I...I met her and she became friend of mine in <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And she always told of me of her times from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we interchanged ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">She was liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">She said, "You know, the Hungarian Jews were amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Because the Hungarian Jews were brought in by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on X days in June or July, and these people had their own clothing where they came...those that survived the transportation because, as you know, many of them died unfortunately in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And as they arrived, they were separated, men and women, all the survivors and they were taken on the same day to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So many Hungarian Jews, according to her, and I know this from history, in a way, they were spared to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They were gassed on the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So this was very important for me to hear, because the Budapest Jews were the last <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> in a way as we call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And the rest we hear...we heard rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We heard the news, but we really didn't know exactly, because you really never knew exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I didn't have a radio or my father had no radio at that time to hear any foreign news. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Anyhow, my father...
QUESTION:  Magda, before you go into that, could you come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  Yes, I can.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  And...and tell us a little bit about what you did at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Well,..uh...the Star of David House was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that my father separated from us because when we went to the Star of David House and again, as you say, I don't remember exactly the date, but 1t must have been June or July when the Budapest Jews were already...you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , they had the Jewish Council who were discussing with Eichmann what to do with the Budapest Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">That I remember historically that it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But my father went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And that particular time, his friends who were my friends and my late mother's friends...they offered him to stay with them and give him false documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So my father didn't live with us in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because as far as I remember, I was the oldest, and my mother and my brother and my father said, "You would be taking care of my mother, your Mum and your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Whatever happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I will be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Whatever I can help, I will help. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">If I can bring food, I will help food. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">If I can take you out, I will take you out, but at least I will be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="305">This was a decision between my mother and father, and I know that he left and he went to live with these people whose name I know, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Steven ___, the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Uh...
QUESTION:  And yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">How did you...
ANSWER:  Me. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I was the one who was the man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And I was a very strong, young girl I think because I said we will have to survive this because my brother, my older brother who I loved terribly, wasn't with us and I said to my mother, "I want to be with my brother.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Because I grew up with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My little brother, of course, was a baby brother we loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But I went with my brother in the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I was a little bit Tom boyish in my life because I was always surrounded with these boys of his <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">My..His friends were my pals, so I was pretty strong little girl I'd say. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I went to all...1n my childhood, all the child illnesses basically, with my brother together, so I thought that, "Yes, we will do it.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So I was the mover. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I was doing...when we went to the David Star...this was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was not emptied by the tenants. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The tenants...they lived in the...1n the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> stayed there, but some Jewish people from other <span class="BUILDING">building</span> like we were...other <span class="DLF">streets</span> , were put into this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So I took my husband also to that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which is now beautifully re...redone actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">In that time, it was a three-floor <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we were just coming in and we were assigned...uh...because the Consier in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> stayed on, was a woman, Christian woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Very nice person, who was apparently appointed by either the Hungarian government or whoever that she...she should order where these people that coming to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> should live. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So she assigned us, my mother and my brother to that <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , to the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but I think we were at least 30-35 people in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So we were cramped together also in...in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where nobody could bring their own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But people they lived in there were their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and we had only this basket with our winter clothing, what not, and some pillows. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I remember that some pillows were stuffed in the basket. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So...
QUESTION:  What was life like for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  Life was like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">You know the government allowed that one or two people in certain hours of the day went still with these <span class="BUILDING">David Star houses</span> , which was not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , could go out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> with the David Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We were all marked of course with the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We all had. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">My father, not. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">My father was...sometimes we didn't even see my father 3, 4 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">When he appeared suddenly during the hour when people...when we could move, he came into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and he told...told us, "Don't go out on Tuesday or Wednesday because I will be coming when you are supposed to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And also the Consiers...this woman whose name was Anna actually, she was quite nice to the people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">She was not a bad person. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So my mother could come time to time to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and bring us bread or bacon which was a no, no, but still whatever he could bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Hot food, I don't remember that he brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But in that time, in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is gas...was gas, and all the____ was a siege city because already bomb...bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The American bombing was there already at that time, but still gas was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So people they had any kind of material which you could obtain down in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345"><span class="DLF">street</span> is a <span class="DLF">street</span> which I went to, walking with my husband, which is a <span class="DLF">street</span> connecting major <span class="DLF">avenues</span> , kind of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Magda, before you get into that, could you come back to the time that you were in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in the Star of David House. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">How long were you there before you moved out into...
ANSWER:  Well, this was sometimes in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Basically, I think it was June. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And from there they took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I didn't go directly to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Tell us about getting to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Who took you there and how did they take you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  Well, they were not taking us. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">They were ordering us. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">There was no taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">That was a time in...by that time I had the Spanish...I had the...I had the Spanish Shutzpass, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  How did you get that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Oh, the <span class="DLF">Shutzpass</span> is another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But let me tell you about my father because that...that is conflict...conflicting with the <span class="DLF">Shutzpass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">My father came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">This was June and July, and we still could go out from the <span class="BUILDING">David House</span> to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> if we had some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We still could cook something on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , if we had one. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We were in a horrible, frightening condition needless to say, because we heard that the Hungarian Nazis are coming to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and getting off people from the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> for a different marches to take them away wherever they wanted to take to deport them. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Needless to say, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We didn't know that exactly where is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And my father was coming back time to time but not too frequent. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And what happened, on one day I went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> because I was again the eldest...to the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I can find some friends or contact because we needed food. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We were very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We had no meat or no milk or nothing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You know, we had flour Nothing really or sometimes, some little bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So we changed with people, or we had friends we could go to some

id="373">So some friends helped sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">One day I went out from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and on the <span class="DLF">street</span> __ I met a professor of mine from the <span class="BUILDING">Commercial Academy</span> who was also a Jewish man and was much elderly than I am, probably I'm ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He must

<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  Magda, how did you get the Spanish pass?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Well, I'm now I'm tell you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Spanish _Shutzpass , Havier, again Havier said, "We will give you the pass which _____ and the Legation issuing for the Jewish population you can have. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But you bring back the pictures.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I brought back the pictures next day right into the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Havier was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Havier took the pictures and took me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Now Perlasca told me today, Mr. Perlasca, that I think I gave it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And I said, "I cannot be sure, but I think it was Spanish police who gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But Havier was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Havier standing by...he said, "I'll see you back again at the <span class="BUILDING">David Star house</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Because I went back to <span class="BUILDING">David Star</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And the truth is that Havier __ came at night 3 times or twice to the <span class="BUILDING">David Star</span> , before we were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He came at night, and Anna let him in and called me down and said Havier brought us some food or some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I don't remember what else. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I remember that he brought me a comb. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">A comb. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Because I didn't have a comb. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And he brought this there, and he said...""Where do we go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And he said, "You will be going to the St. Stephen's Park House," and he give the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Either was St. Stephen Park 9 or 7. [</span><span class="sentence" id="629">NB: Subsequent to the interview, Mrs. Lapidus remembered that it was #35, not #7 or #9, <span class="DLF">St. Stephen Park</span> ] I have to verify this with Mr. Perlasca because he immediately knew that you were in the St. Stephen's House. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And I don't remember... although I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in 77, and even now in 85, I don't remember the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Anyhow, he told us that that's where we have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">But apparently there was no...not enough time within the period that I had the pass from Havier and from the Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I didn't even understand the connection why the Spanish Legation will issue such thing because I was an intelligent girl,, and I knew that Franco is a fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I know that Franco was neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I didn't think about any Blue Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I learned this from Havier because Havier told me when I asked, "What is your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="637">and he said, "My have is Havier___, and my name 1s very famous because there was a Spanish poet in the same name.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I was telling you this before, and I tell you how I came to this___.. Alll the time, 45 years I had Havier ____ in my mind, and Havier said, "You will go to <span class="BUILDING">St. Stephen House</span> , but I tell you when.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Curiously enough when he came on that night and brought this little comb and brought the food, I will see you in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish house</span> because I was supposed to go there with my mother and my brother during the 3 hours was assigned to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But I don't know why we didn't because we...we landed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They lined us up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Now I had the pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Really, we had this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We couldn't carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Just as we were, except the pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">No documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Nothing except these two papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and when we arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on the same day...the next day, they were not only the Hungarian autocrats people, they were Hungarian police force. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">The regular Hungarian police was...of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I remember exactly how they were in uniform because I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I made a little conversation because I was a young woman, you know, an attractive woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I made a conversation with a police officer there and I said, "You know, I have here some document. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I shouldn't be here in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at all.‚Äù‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Because I was...I was very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We didn't have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">We didn't have nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I...knowing what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is from not only because I was so dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I know...I heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We heard every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Why would I be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when I grew up in a civilized surrounding? </span><span class="sentence" id="664">You know, I was frightened of the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And I told this to this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">He was an old policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">A fat, heavy set, mustache, pleasant Hungarian policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I don't remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I only know that told him that I told him, "How can we get away? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I don't have anything to give you. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I...we have nothing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He said, "You don't have to give me. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I bring you out there.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="674">You know, in his Hungarian peasant way. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">We stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and this <span class="DLF">street</span> was Old. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">That's why I remember the <span class="DLF">street</span> because it's a crazy name. </span><span class="sentence" id="677"><span class="DLF">Old Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But that was <span class="DLF">Old Street</span> , Old. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Which was on the __ of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">He said, "I will bring you out.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I said, "I don't have to bring me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I have a mother and my little brother as you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">You have to...three of us, we have to go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He said, "T'll bring you out there.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">One evening when it was curfew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He led us through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was really closed in as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But that was not closed in in that time by <span class="DLF">fence</span> because when I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in 1945, it was totally closed in with kind of an old <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and I seen already when the...when the dead people were thrown into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">That was already sometimes in 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So he took us on a very... because we were in a <span class="INT_SPACE">downstairs apartment</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So he took us out and he said, "You have to run with me.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Now you can imagine that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldsa</span> , the ghetto area, and <span class="DLF">St. Stephen

the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Margaret Island</span> , to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , so it was a very beautiful area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It still is. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">As a matter of fact, when I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">It's a distance from

<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  We're going to go back now to the experience with the safe pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">We are going to ask you again as...as directly as you can to tell us the procedure that you went through...uh...with Havier to obtain that safe pass and how you then find yourself through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> experience back in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish safe house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  Can I tell you now? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Well...uh...just as I... mentioned before, my old professor, my professor met me on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , on one of these 3 hours, indicated that the Spanish Legation is issuing Shutz passes__, safety passes for some of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They come to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> , and that means for me that they will put us in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> assigned by the Hungarian government under the safety and the protection of the Spanish Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So that exactly we done. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">We went to the Spanish Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">We went through with a hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">THey were standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">We came into this little so-called, if I remember, <span class="INT_SPACE">fore-room</span> like, not the <span class="INT_SPACE">Ambassador's room</span> , but <span class="INT_SPACE">reception room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">That would be the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And as soon as we got 1n, we got to this young Spaniard who I didn't know that time, but whose name was Havier, because later on I learned, and he explained to us what he needs and he explained to us that through this document we will be able to move away from the <span class="BUILDING">David Star House</span> to a protected <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which will be protected with the Spanish Legation, and hopefully, we can survive all this horrible upheaval in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So I was very grateful, and I said that I'm not only alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I have my mother and my brother...and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I wanted...I told him my father is already taken, but still my father? </span><span class="sentence" id="752">He said, "Never mind.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="753">He explained to me that I have to bring photographs of the family. "</span><span class="sentence" id="754">Do I have it.: </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I said, "Yes, I have it because my has a basket which is full of family pictures in a container and that also survived during the war, interestingly enough, and I can cut out some of the photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And I didn't ask much of him what we have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I just asked, "Do you know where we will stay?" </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And he said, "Well, at the moment he didn't know," but he said, "When you come with the photographs and when you have the pass and you have these documentations in you hand, we will direct you and we will tell you what happen.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Because, forget now the time is also short. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">We had an hour or two, I don't remember, to come and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So I thanked and I left with my...my professor together, actually from the Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">He done his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">He said goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I never seen my professor ever after. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I went back on next day on the same hour to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">The <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> was equally crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I was looking for this man because he was my connect...contact at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> , so and I asked, "What's your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He said, "Havier," I didn't know that time that his name was Havier . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I didn't even ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I didn't care, but I said that he gave me the documents which was...he didn't give me really himself the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I think that time police gave me the document. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">He was only present to give me this document. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">He came with me out and said, "Keep this document because it's very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I will let you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I'll let you know...in that <span class="BUILDING">House</span> in <span class="BUILDING">David House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Where you live?" </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I said, "I am living King Street 95 or 93.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I don't remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">It's true he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Not the same night. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Two or three days after, he brought us food and he said, "We learned that the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish protected buildings</span> " ...he mentioned a number of them...""You will go to the St. Stephens Park building. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And I asked him, "Do I go now or tomorrow when I am free to go out from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="784">He said not yet, because the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is not hundred percent arranged apparently with the Hungarian government because I suppose the Legation had to discuss with the government who goes and who doesn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">The <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were apparently, what I learned later, vacated with everybody who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and given to the Spanish Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">All these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">The people, they lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , whether they were Gentiles, Christians, whatever, they had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So they had a hard time probably through this too. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Any how, so Havier when he came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">David Street house</span> , I asked him during the conversation...I told him that my father was already taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">He said, "He can be on the document too.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And he is on the document, his picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I said, "Where...how will be this...this departure?" </span><span class="sentence" id="793">He said, "T'll let you know when you have to go to the <span class="DLF">St. Stephens Park</span> when it's ready to be...to move there.‚Äù‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And on that particular night, I asked, "What is your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And he said to me, "My name is Havier .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="796">That's how I remember those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Forget that many years passed by and that name was in my mind since I speak Spanish, and in the meantime I learned Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I lived in a <span class="REGION">Latin country</span> and so I _____ was in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And he mentioned also right way, that is a very important name because a Spanish poet had this name, this same name. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So I accepted that, and he also told me that...are you employed. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I said, "Are you with the Spanish Legation?" </span><span class="sentence" id="802">He said, "No, I am... am with the Blue Division. "</span><span class="sentence" id="803">Do you know what the Blue Division 1s?" </span><span class="sentence" id="804">he asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And I says, "Yes, I know the Blue Division is the...the Corps, the elite Corps of Franco.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And I knew that the Blue Division was fighting in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> on Hitler's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And h.He said, "How come that you hear it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="808">We are deserters. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">We left. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">The offensive came, and we just run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">There is some of them...some of us at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Which was proved to me today by Mr. Perlasca, because I didn't know that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">What was very interesting that in other time when he came again to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">David House</span> , he said come tomorrow and said that I should come back to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And I did go back to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> on other time. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And I don't know why he wanted to...that I should come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And I came and he said, "I will show you some of the people that we are hiding here at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And I didn't ask yet...Mr. Perlasca, he has to tell me because there was a puzzle in my mind that he took me back in the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or in a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> divided with a little <span class="DLF">stairway</span> and the <span class="DLF">stairway</span> you go up and there were men sitting up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Two men were sitting up there, and they were Hungarian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I don't...I don't remember who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And we were talking to each other and I said, "I am from the King Street David Star House and I tried to go back to my mother and brother and take them to...to the Spanish Legation protected <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we just said goodbye and I never went back anymore to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So in my mind, it's still a mystery who were these people that Havier let me talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Because we spoke German...Hungarian...I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Havier didn't speak Hungarian a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">My conversation was with Havier _____ only in I my good German and his broken German. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And so I left, and I went back, said goodbye and I left back. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">This was the hour from 10 to 12 or whatever the hour was, and I never seen them again, him again, only at the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish protected house</span> because after this, I was taken away with my mother to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and with my little brother, we lined up in marching to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and that where I was lucky and smart enough to make contact with this Hung...this old policeman, who risked his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And not only that he risked his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I'll tell you more about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  Before you tell me more about him, we would like to get you back to the relationship you had with Havier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  That was the relationship that was...then emptiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">There was nothing happened until I got with my mother and brother to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish protected house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">When we got to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish protected house</span> , the policeman left us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And there were so many people already in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that they accommodated us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  No, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is after the <span class="BUILDING">protected house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">We left with the policeman after...I wasn't long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I must say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Maybe 2 days or 3 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Because I told this policeman, "I have this document. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Please rescue us.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And he says, "I will," as he does...he done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">When he done...when we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish protected house</span> , there were a lot of people already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">He left us. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">It was night time. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We were pushed into there, to stay there and we said, "Here is our document.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And there were no...no leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I don't remember any leadership in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Everybody went wherever they could stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I couldn't go anywhere with my mother except to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was terrible, because the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> has water. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And so we really suffered for a long, long while in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  How long were you there, Magda?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">ANSWER:  Well, this was probably the end of October, beginning of November, and I was...we were liberated in January the 18 by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And when the Russian came into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , we still stayed for quite awhile because there was war...that was a siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We didn't go out at least another 3, 4 weeks from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  What did you do while you were in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="857">How did you spend your time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  Well, I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">First of all, I have to tell you that we didn't have anything as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We told the Hungarian policeman that if you want to help us, if you can, in the <span class="DLF">King Street</span> on that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I told him the address...93 or 95. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I think it was 95. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">On the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> number so and so, there is a basket and that's all our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Can you bring that eventually? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">He did bring it to the protected <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Not immediately, but after a few days where we had the two or three pillows in there, so we had some warm...warmer clothing and some pots and pans. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But at that time, if I remember correctly, in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there were no gas, no electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">So the people there had to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And my mother had two big bags of flour...I remember that...in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And she didn't...we couldn't eat anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">My brother and my...we didn't eat anything else during all the time until well after...even when the Russian came in...only snow water was...this was heavy snow...brought in at night from the <span class="DLF">street</span> by others too in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was made a little fire into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas stove</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , pieces whoever found it...little wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Some people went even out...I don't know how they got it...some branches because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branches</span> were all empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">No leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">So they brought that in and we made fire on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And my mother, in one of the pots of snow water, made...we called it, very funny now when that it comes to mind, we called it __ because it was flat like a pancake, but it was just flour and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And it was delicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">That's what we eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">That was our staple. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Well, we didn't do anything in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">People stuck together if they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They were bombing in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...outside in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and afraid who comes to pick us up because there were a million rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Because, you know, you heard all the time, the shootings and the bombings and the time to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish protected house</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Margaret Island</span> , we knew from rumors that there are still German soldiers and Hungarian autocrats people they tried to...to beat, to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And not only that, during that period...that time that we were in the protected <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and later on we were upstairs...they accommodated us upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And we were on the last <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and I asked Mr. Perlasca today, "Was it five floors or was it nine floors?" </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And he said, "I think it was five floors.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And I think it was nine floors.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We were on the top on this protected <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">On...during that period of time, there was an explosion and the <span class="DLF">Margaret Island bridge</span> exploded totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">All the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , by the way, the Hungarians probably did, but we seen it through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were all blown in, so there was no <span class="DLF">windows</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I only remember that I was standing in the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I said, "Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">The <span class="DLF">bridge</span> goes.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And my face and my hair was full of glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And all little bloods running which I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But they says, "What happened to your face?" </span><span class="sentence" id="898">The little glass went into my hair and cut me. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I put this down that there was a professor on the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , a Hungarian surgeon, whose name I don't remember ____ and he cleaned by face with a little clip or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Look, my face 1s still here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">QUESTION:  Yes, it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Magda, when you were in the safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , how safe was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  It wasn't safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">It wasn't safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">There was nobody who...it was safe because it was protected by the Spanish flag, so maybe some Hungarians or some Germans maybe respected or respected not. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">But because we didn't know this, whether they would respect us, we were in constant fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Also, there were all the rumors how the people got it...we only heard the rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I wasn't <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I went only <span class="NPIP">outside</span> sometimes at night for water because the younger people...there were a lot of elderly people in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , you know, not only my age and my mother...much older people they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I know that in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where I was, on the end, two people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And they were very elderly, Mr. and Mrs. Elephant. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So there were a variety of..of people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So we...we were protected by them, it's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">They risked their lives, but we didn't know whether we were protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Because we heard the rumors that the Hungarian...uh...Nazis, they are going to even to the protected <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and try to take out people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  Did anybody try to take anyone out of your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That's the last time...the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...not the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That was the last time I seen Havier, and that's the last time when...I think and I believe that all so Mr. Perlasca and other Spaniards were at the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">This was on a...on a morning hours at 5 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">It must have been...I think it must have been end of November.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">QUESTION:  What happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">ANSWER:  It happened the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">On early morning, the shouting was 1n the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...I was actually downstairs at that time with my mother and my brother, downstairs in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and they came...the Hungarian Nazis and they said, "Everybody who is in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> has to come out and line up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> .‚Äù‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Mind you, it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">It was snow, ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">That particular winter apparently was colder than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And everybody from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , from <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> , they all have to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Because some people they even slept on the <span class="DLF">stairways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They were...I don't know where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Everybody has to line up. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">When we lined up, we just didn't know exactly what will happen, only what we heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">That these people will be marching us directly into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and will kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">That much I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I didn't tell this to my mother and little brother but I said, "This is the end of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">If these people will take us out and the Spanish are not around to save us, we are dead.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And it happened to other people I know after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">To us it didn't happen because...I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">That's what I have to find out from Mr. Perlasca. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">How is it possible that on that morning, suddenly the Spanish Legation representative, one of them was Havier ____ with a document in his hand and maybe Mr. Perlasca, because there were others...they were debating and shouting and discussing with the Hungarian Nazis downstairs that this is...they cannot...this 1s Spanish diplomatic protection, and they were really fighting for us...for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I only stood there...downstairs, because we were downstairs, and other people all lined up...on the <span class="DLF">stairway</span> lined up, because there were at least 200 in my opinion in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And they were shouting and discussing and in the meantime, we heard shootings. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">It was already the end of the war for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">The Russians were all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And one minute to the other, it took us minute, my brother...my brother, George, had a little knapsack because that was in this...in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> ...had on his shoulder...had a little cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I see him as today...is behind me because I was in the front, my brother and my...and all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">There were others...lot of people in the same situation as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">We freight...what...how can we get away from this? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And the Spanish people from the Legation whether it was Havier or Mr. Perlasca, Giorgia Perlasca, whoever it was, they won over these Hungarian Nazis, and they tell, "You cannot touch these people because this is the Spanish government protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">The Spanish government was befriended with the Hungarian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They got none because the Spanish Franco was a fascist, and the Spanish Legation was there until the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And that morning because it was still dark, Havier came to me and to my mother and to my brother and to others...I'm sure he said goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I only observe what he done to us, and he said, "We are seeing you last time. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">The Legation must leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> because we are surrounded with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">The Russian come in and close in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> any minute.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And I said, "Where do you go, Havier?" </span><span class="sentence" id="958">He said, "We go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Do you want to come along?" </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And I said, "How do you go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I said, "By <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we all...we will leave the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> , whatever the Ambassador...everybody has to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">We close the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> , what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And he said, "you want to come along?" </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And I said, "I will never go without my mother and brother, which is true, and we embraced and everybody embraced. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">It was a terrible moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">It's terrible even me for now. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And he left and disappeared 1n the blue yonder.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Okay, at the moment that...that Havier and others argued against the Germans that convinced them to allow you to stay...
ANSWER:  They convinced that we should stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They convinced them that this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is under the Swiss...Spanish Legation, Spanish government protection, and they cannot touch us because they are Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">They are diplomat, and they cannot go. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And when I read the article 1s absolutely that's how it...how it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">QUESTION:  Was that the last problem that you encountered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">ANSWER:  That was what is interesting what you asking me because, curiously enough, after that period of time that the Hungarians cleared the way, these Nazis and the Spanish, everybody cleared it away, the misery was there in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because we didn't know that nobody else will bother us, but I don't recall in my mind, thinking about this million times, that anybody from the Hungarian Nazis, or the Germans or anybody or no Spaniards, nobody came to that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We were on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I only know that there was a heavy shooting, bombing, all this December what I heard...if this was the beginning of December because I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I don't recall that until the ___ that anybody was bugging the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I don't remember that any Hungarian came. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">At least, we were upstairs really with my mother and brother and, you know, we were hundred...I don't know how many people were in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , probably 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  What did people eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">ANSWER:  We didn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Nobody ate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">QUESTION:  How did you survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I was...I was skeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION:  During the period of these two weeks.</span></p>

unable to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">This is...this is all the post card. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So that was the last which we had or still when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">David Star house</span> and we kept this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">When after the liberation, after we settled into this ____ <span class="BUILDING">street house</span> where we could stay because we couldn't go back to our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , every piece was stolen.
