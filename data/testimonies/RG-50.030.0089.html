bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">The bread was good at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">When you were hungry, you could eat it, and it was 5 or 6 hundred grams. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Little bit more than a pound of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yetsevel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yetsevel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">That was originally a point where the first prisoners came. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It was only a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They got...all they got was a saw and a hammer, whatever, to build there a

</span><span class="sentence" id="204">And that was the place that the Germans used to call the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> , which is the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And there we were gathered together. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And when we arrived...of course, hungry, exhausted, with lice, first met a Jewish fellow and he was in charge of

then they sent you away it's so bad there and somebody come back he...he cannot tell us anything good. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So the next morning, we went out...1t was about...was not more than Il or 12 kilometers from there and we went on the <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> because there was no <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There was no other way but by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> went once a day or went every two days, to and back on the same...same...uh...same...uh...same...same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">When we arrived in that....that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> by the name of Meuselwitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">In my opinion there were there not less than 3 or 4 thousand prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">There were already Polish prisoners there or Jewish prisoners there and first when we came we were put in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or call it...uh...to... to...where...where you...where you live and where you sleep, and that was like made out of a few boards and the wind was blowing in. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">In the middle was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron furnace</span> and the prisoners came <span

id="218">Otherwise, it was cold all...all over and the only light that was there was about in a big, big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a little about maybe... The next day we had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">How do we get the soup? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You don't get anything in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Don't get the fork. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Don't get the spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">You have to see that you get it, that you make it yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So there were <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> who said I will first go and then you...give it to you when it's empty and you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But you have to be 1n time <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They made spoons out of wood and the can that

class="sentence" id="229">When they saw there was a lot of Jews, they played Jewish songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Like ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">When we went out to work, we went over | and a half hours til we got there where I work was. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And what was the work? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">To cut <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Not with electric cuts, but two men with a saw and others had to transport it and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I was not able to do that work and I was when I came back I did a little something in order not to go to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ...in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and I got...uh...300 grams of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Others got 700 because they worked good. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But it showed after them that after 2 years of that kind of work that I was better off than the others because they got more bread, but they died too from the hard work, and I somehow survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I became so thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I lost a lot of weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">You could see all my ribs. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">In June of 1900...0f 1941 when the Germans attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , we heard it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on loud speaker and the...uh...all the foreigners were told they're going to freedom if they are Polish citizens because of the attack on...on...on...on <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I was not called. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Most of them were called, and every day so and so many disappeared to so-called freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Three months later, I was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Was one of those cases that they didn't know what to do with. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I was caught...taken on <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> , had relatives that were Polish...Polish citizens and I, on the other hand, was German born. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So I was sent back and was...that was the most terrible time in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I was beaten up by other prisoners because they thought I was too...too happy to go...to go away but I was still one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">These prisoners were...had the same faces like ____ today and Armenian but were there and accused Jews that because of us they are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The Jews are the leaders of communism and as I am a Jew, they beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">When I see today on television those faces, these were the people they did it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the man that cut the bread was sentenced in 37 to 10 years because he was ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">There was a time when Stalin cleaned out and then he found somebody _____ and got 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I got only 5 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">The doctor was a ____, and the other doctor was a_. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And when there came Yom Kippur I went to the doctor and I told him I

id="258">The second one I had to go to work, but I did not work, but when I came back I got 10 days <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So I spent 10 days with young boys age 10 to 14 or 16 who played cards on my rags that I had there and they made me sleep at the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I had to take it out, and I got my bread...instead of picking it up I got it 3 hours later and the soup cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">In day time I went to work and when I came back from work this was a 10-days <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The...uh...second Yom Kippur I did not work because I complained again and this doctor shouted at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">His name was Ilia Selimonowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I don't have the family name. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And he said you don't want to work and that's it, and you will go to work, that's it, and get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The next day the marchik is the...that is a man who drives you to work, that sees to it that nobody stays <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It's usually a criminal and many years of experience there and if necessary, he beats you up, then...then you have enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You will remember next time not to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">He...uh...called out my name that I am not going because I'm sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So this whole scene was made by the doctor in order not to be under suspicion that he is on a high holiday...on a high holiday, Jewish high holiday freeing prisoners not to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The third Yom Kippur...I came before that already an invalid because I was weighing....I did not know my weight, but I was so thin and so weak that they could not push me to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So the doctors, Polish doctor declared me an invalid of _._That means I have the right to sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I get a piece of the bread and the soup and I don't have to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So that Yom Kippur I did not go to work because I didn't have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I mention that because it was...at that time when I started to give a account, I had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I had a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I had a mother, a brother, a sister, relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And all probably looked where I am, hungry and almost dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">My body was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It was my soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">My knowledge of my religion, my education from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Homburg</span> that made me think I will survive, gave me hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I used to cover myself and forget where I am and dreaming that today is holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The fourth Yom Kippur I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> lost a lot of people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and in the war at all, and they started to empty out <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> ...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> , especially those people that could not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And they want them out maybe to replace the men that were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So I was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">There I was told I cannot go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He looked at me and he said in Russian language,"___——.”” He is such a bird. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They don't know what to do with.” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There is such an expression in Russian, __. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Such a bird! </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So I was sent back and a few days later I was called to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and I was told to go take my few things, less than I brought here today. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And there was a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> waiting and a woman was sitting on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">She's going to have a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And I...and the...the man with the gun, __, went with us to go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Could see it from far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">workers' camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">In contrast to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was an assembly place for those they took eventually go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I couldn't walk that far so I told him I cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I was sitting down in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So he told the woman to go up...down, and put me up because the horse could not pull that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Such a horse wasn't fat either. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We finally arrived after | and a half hours there and there I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there was sitting a woman that...uh...told me, "Grandpa.” </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I looked at her because I had a beard and I walked with a cane which I bought for a piece of bread...that somebody made out of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And she said, "Take a look.” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I said, "I'm not a grandpa. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I'm 39 years old, and I...” And she said, "Take a look at the mirror.” </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And it was the first time in many years that I saw a mirror and I didn't recognize myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Being friendly to me...she was a ___, she was a prisoner too. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">She told me...uh...I told her, "I'm hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I didn't get anything to eat from the morning til now. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It's afternoon.” </span><span class="sentence" id="313">She said, "I cannot give you anything I don't have.” </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And it was Christmastime, and nobody was there of the high ranking. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And she said, "Evenings when they give everybody to eat again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So I had to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And I got the piece of bread and I went..before that I went to the ___, so called <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and told the doctor I hardly can walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I'm hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he looked at me and he never saw somebody with the ribs out like this and he put me on the scale and I weigh...weighed 40 kilo, which you know is 88 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It was the first time in 4 years I found out how much I weigh. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So he put me in the so called sick... sick...uh...<span class="NPIP">place</span> , and there I got twice a day soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The bread was brought...brought to me, and one spoonful of oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">What kind of oil I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">After 14 days...it's the most time a man can be there, I didn't gain because he weighed me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I didn't weigh...weigh...uh...gain any weight, but he told me he has to sign me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I was signed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I was put in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and the people there...working people. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And when they saw somebody weak, never from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> where you're beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They didn't touch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">When you stood before them, you had to have your hands in the back and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Never! </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Never! </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Never! </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They told you only in nasty words but otherwise you were not beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The prisoners were among themselves because so many nationalities which hated themselves and they were altogether there in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Uh...One tried to take away this like can that I had where I got my...my...my soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The other one saw my...my jacket which was rags was better than his, and he wanted me to exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But lucky enough towards evening...quite a bit of people came back from work and among them boys from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Jewish boys from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Oh, I said...and I am bad on Germans and working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">This is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> and I will not go free. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And that was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But they had flour because they worked unloading flour and they brought flour with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And they took water and flour and made it because our soup was watery. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">The spoon did not stand, but there the spoon stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And they gave me as much as I wanted of flour and water and with a spoon to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I told them about what the others do to me and they went over and told them, "You are talking here to soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">You will get it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And they let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They called me uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Was 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">21 years boys that were expelled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Children of...probably of parents that once were from <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and the children are born there and they were prisoners there. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">What happens to them I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Anyhow, after a short while I was called back to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">When I came to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> it was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Only a few people from...uh...which you see now on television from this..from those Republic that wants to be by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They...we had there to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The food was not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Again a piece of bread and that soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So I had no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I lived everyday in and out, but I didn't go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">It was in February. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It was Christmastime. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was in February. </span><span
