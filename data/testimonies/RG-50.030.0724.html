<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  And the other <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were either rented as a whole, or in a couple instances, I think divided into two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My father owned the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and we had a teeny <span class="DLF">garden</span> in the front, and a slightly larger one in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And my — I had an old — still have an older sister, an older brother, and I’m the baby in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I would say that my parents belonged to what one would call a middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And as I said, the whole time that I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> was in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And when you said that your father served in World War I, could you say a bit more about his experiences during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  My father went in in 1914, was assigned as a replacement on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> , and for a time was in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , with a pair of field glasses, to locate where their shells were fa — were landing, from their artillery, to correct that. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">He was promoted to noncommissioned officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And when the battalion commander put him in for a field commission, the regimental commander turned it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">As he explained, that is the regimental commander, this is a Prussian guard reserve regiment, and we cannot have a Jewish officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Subsequently, I believe in 1916, the unit was transferred to the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And in the fighting before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , and what 1s today <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , my father was badly wounded in the arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And since it was his right arm, he could no longer fire a weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So that after he recovered, they recalled that he hadMarch 13, 2012 legal training, and made him the legal officer, the chief legal officer of one of these scratch divisions put together for occupation duty in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And he spent — but he was, by this time, promoted, and was what the Germans call a Rittmeister, and that would be the equivalent of a captain in the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And he served that way until demobilization in 1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And then, as I said, instead of going back into the judiciary, transferred to the new German national ministry of finance, something that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had not had between 1871 and 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">If you think of your extended family, were there noteworthy personalities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  I suppose there were two. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My grandfather on mother’s side was a judge in the <span class="REGION">Rhineland</span> , and came to be what the Germans called an Oberlandesgerichtshof, which would be the equivalent of a associate judge in the state supreme court in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And he was not promoted to chief judge, because he would have had to convert, and he was not about to do that, when it was offered to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">A slightly more distant relative lived not in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> , as my grandfather did, but in the Grand Duchy Oldenburg, which is in <span class="REGION">northwest Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And before the first World War, he was on the top court of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And when the chief justice of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldenburg</span> died, they discovered to their horror — that is, the grand duke, and the minister of justice, that the next senior judge was a Roman Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And in thatMarch 13, 2012 part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which 1s traditionally overwhelmingly Protestant, they did not think that that would work very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The next senior judge was a Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But by the time we’re talking about, 1912, or thereabouts, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldenburg</span> , because of <span class="DLF">port</span> and industrial development had a substantial Catholic minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I don’t know what the percentage would be, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was 10 - 15 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And the grand duke, and the minister of ju — prime minister and minister of justice were concerned that if they obviously passed over a Catholic, to appoint a Protestant, this Catholic minority would be very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So they decided to pass over both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And the last chief justice of the Grand Duchy of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldenburg</span> was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I’ve always thought as a historian, that this is an example how people can trap themselves into absolute stupidity, because of course, this had nothing to do with qualifications, politics, or anything of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">It was just that they couldn’t have a Catholic chief justice, and they couldn’t annoy the Catholic minority, by putting in the next, so I guess they annoyed them all, by arranging to have a Jewish chief justice as the last chief justice of the Grand Duchy. [</span><span class="sentence" id="35">technical interruption]
QUESTION:  Can I — can I ask you about experiences with anti-Semitism? </span><span class="sentence" id="36">With social anti- Semitism, and you know, like I mean, pre ’33? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Because you’re already touching on it, like you know, the very fact that somebody would have to convert to become — March 13, 2012 you know, to take on a position is a — of course, you know, pointing to ingrained anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I mean, the camera is off right now, I would —
ANSWER:  Oh, I see, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Yeah, well we can talk about — Ill talk about that briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Okay, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And was your family observing? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Did your family have strong ties into the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  My family belonged to the — what in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would be called the Reform Jewish congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , though by American standards, I believe these would be considered a Conservative congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And we went on the high holidays, occasionally on other times. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We celebrated Friday evenings regularly at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; you know, Passover, Chanukah, and other such events, so that — and in time each of us went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> for some training. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So, there was no doubt about the affiliation of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  How many Jews lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> at the time, do you know’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> at the time — excuse me — was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of about half a million, and there about 5,500 roughly, just over one percent Jewish community there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  And did your family have any experience with anti-Semitism before 1933?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Well, what one has to keep in mind is that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from 1871, until 1919, was a federal state. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">On the national level, there were not legal regulations specifically affecting Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But the states that made up <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , had regu — their own March 13, 2012 regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So that in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> , which is where the majority of Jews lived, and where my parents lived, no Jew could be an officer in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They all did their military duty, but they knew ahead of time they could — there were no such things as commissioned Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Whereas in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , the did it differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There were Jews among the Bavarian officer corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was also a rule in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> , and I’m talking not about discrimination now, I’m talking about legally established regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Jews could not hold administrative positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So that when my father grew up, he knew he could never be postmaster of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where he lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">In the case of my grandfather, in other words, if he was going to be the chief justice, as the king of <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> also, and pro — <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had agreed, being the chief jus — of the justices meant administrative responsibilities, and he declined to convert to Christianity in order to accept that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We tend to forget in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that legal disabilities in Europe lasted very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , the last major legal disabilities on Catholics and Jews don’t disappear until the 1880s. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the last legal disabilities end in 1919, because they were on the state level, not the national level. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">When my father was in the military, 1t was very clear as — as I said, you could not be an officer in this one unit, and then later became an officer in a different unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">There was also, of course, some discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But since I was not alive and adult at the time, I did not really run into those sorts of things until after I became five, March 13, 2012 six, seven years old, and was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and noticed what was being done to Jews, and what was discussed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">After the — Hitler became chancellor in 1933, there was, as I said, on the one hand, until 1919, legal disabilities, I guess you would call them, and then, at the same time, some discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  What is your — what is your — what are your fondest memories of your childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”
ANSWER:  The fondest memories, I guess, are associated in part with a pet white mouse that I greatly enjoyed, and that became totally tame. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And th-th — what was also important for me was that while Jews could not go to the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> , I couldn’t learn how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And there were other such restrictions, for reasons that I’ve never figured out. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There were, at least in those days, no prohibitions on Jews going to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And Hannover had — and still has, to the best of my knowledge, a very large, very nice <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I enjoyed going there and watching the animals, and I particularly enjoyed the arrangement they had, where for a very small fee, the kids up to a certain weight — weight, could ride on a turtle. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I thought that riding on a Galapagos turtle was really very much a — a wonderful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Another thing that I enjoyed as a kid, was that great aunt and uncle, who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> , outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> , had on their <span class="REGION">property</span> — small <span class="REGION">estate</span> , I guess you would call it, two royalMarch 13, 2012 cranes that walked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I suspect today, because I was their height, they liked to walk around with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And the idea of walking around with two cranes that wandered around with me, I thought was really very special and very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And since they had also a <span class="DLF">tennis court</span> where they and guests played tennis, the three of us would sometimes walk over there and watch people play tennis. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Unfortunately, nobody had sense enough to take a picture, but I — I just thought that walking around with two tall cranes, exactly my height, and not on a leash or anything, but that just decided that they would walk around with me, was really very, very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I also very much enjoyed this grandfather, who by this time had retired from being a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We would go to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> where they lived, and feed what were essentially tame deer. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I thought that that was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The other thing he would do, which was probably not nice for him, but for me, was there was a <span class="DLF">switching yard</span> , where there were those small steam engines that put <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we’d go puff puff. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Well, we were under the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that we walked on, and we would disappear in the smoke, and then reappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And that too, I thought was really great, good fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Well, you touched already, about the changes that came with 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I mean, how did you, as a child, experience the onset of national socialism inMarch 13, 2012 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I mean, how and when did Nazi rule begin to impact your everyday life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Well, it began to impact my everyday life in two ways when I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in °34. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">In the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself, there were nasty comments from other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">In the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of the time, all kids went to gender segregated <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And while in the first part of that, that 1s, °34, ’35, ’36, the teacher I have [indecipherable] kind of restrained, I think it would be best to say, other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was rather unpleasant, and in the later years in the <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> , the kids would beat up on me, and I would have to try to make my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by devious ways, because I didn’t want to get beaten up so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I carried with me for the next 10 - 20 years, a tendency to get very bad nosebleeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">In 1934, when my father was tossed out of his job — he had been allowed to keep it, in the <span class="BUILDING">local office</span> of the ministry of finance, because he was front veteran at the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But when President Hindenburg died in, I believe it’s August of ’34, then those people were also tossed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So he normal — no longer went to work, off every morning, and instead d-decided to earn his living by what the Germans call a devisen berauter, a foreign exchange advisor, and in practice what it meant was that because of his background, he understood the constantly changing regulations on what people leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could take with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so, our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> was converted into hisMarch 13, 2012 <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , where he met clients. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">front hall</span> , where you came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , became a <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">In other words, people would wait there, and then see my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> changed in a way, and Dad did this — that is to say, did this kind of work from 1934 until my parents left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the spring of ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And the fact that we didn’t have a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> any more, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">front hall</span> wasn’t available, in a sense, certainly made a change in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But the main change wa — I would say, a sense of — that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> didn’t want you there, and that other kids were very unfriendly — with a few exceptions, not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And my brother, a year and a half older, found this an impossible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My parents took him out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , sent him to live with a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So that during the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, my brother was not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He was, as I said, living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Evidently, from what I gathered from my sister, she did not have — I mean, not that everybody was friendly with her, but she didn’t have that kind of situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It got substantially worse after a couple of years, because we were told that the teacher that — whom I mentioned, was ill, and retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My parents told me many years later that he had been a Quaker, and had been fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And so, we got another teacher, who did not restrain the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So that was —
QUESTION:  Which — which grade was this? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Were you third grade, fourth grade?March 13, 2012
ANSWER:  This was the third and fourth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And then, my parents were talking about leaving the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And first thought that they would li — stay out their lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but th — there was no future for the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We had relatives in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and they applied for quota numbers to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and in fact sent us to start learning English. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">There were two elderly ladies, sisters, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , who were from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and we went — started to learn English from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Though I have to admit that I was probably more intrigued by their parrot than th — by their English lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And then in the — after the four years, in the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of the time, you went to — either you stayed, or you went to what was essentially a university preparatory system, a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and I moved to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And there we started English. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And so I learned a little English there. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But of course, then in November °38, I was kicked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But I started learning English more systematically in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And did the behavior of your neighbors change in any way? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">People who also lived in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Anything you remember there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  [coughing] Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Well, if it did, I was not aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The — for reasons that I honestly don’t know, the people who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> above us and below us, simply had very little contact with each other in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They all — everybody lived their own lives, in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And so if they behaved differentlyMarch 13, 2012 towards my parents, or us afterwards, I didn’t notice it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we had had, of course, some friends and acquaintances, my parents did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but if that changed, I frankly don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> was attacked very early on, already in March 1933 was the first attack on the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> a particularly anti-Semitic town?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  I’m inclined, frankly, to doubt that, because whatever happened in this incident in 1933, when I was knowingly going there with some regularity with my parents, there were no incidents until 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So that in the period in between, there weren’t, to my knowledge, problems and I think it unlikely that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> was in any way, substantially different from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> of some size in the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  And what happened to your father during Kristallnacht, 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  In November ’38, as soon as things started going wild, the folks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> put my brother on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and sent him back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">On the 10" or 11" of November, I was still during the day in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at this point, my brother was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my sister was also still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the police came. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Dad was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The police had come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , whereas I said, my father worked at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so he would be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during the day, and took him to the <span class="BUILDING">local police lockup</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They clearly were operating from aMarch 13, 2012 list that had been prepared long before, because the man who opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> for them, who together with his wife and boy, lived with us, was Jewish and was not picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And they asked, as I was told when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , for a man who lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">upstairs apartment</span> , who had died months before, but who was still on their list. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They took him to the <span class="BUILDING">local police lockup</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And the one thing I recall, and the other I learned later — the thing I recall was that Mother called the three of us together, and asked us if we had any cash, and if we had any unused postage stamps, because the government had frozen all accounts, and she might have to buy some groceries, or some stamps to write letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The other thing I only learned later. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after something like three days, and I learned that what had happened was, that Mother had gone to his former boss, the finance president — that 1s, the head of the <span class="BUILDING">finance office</span> , who had originally, back in the 20s, been very upset when a Jewish official was assigned to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , who would have nothing to do with my parents socially, until Dad was kicked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Then he called on my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">One didn’t treat people that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So in ’38, four years la — four years and some months later, my mother went to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And he called the head of the police and told him to let the — Dr. Weinberg out. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And when the finance president calls the poli — [indecipherable] president, something happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And so Dad got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We learned, however, that his twin brother — he had one twin brother and no other siblings — was March 13, 2012 arrested and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">A couple of other, more distant relatives also were arrested and put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But as I said, Dad was let out of the <span class="BUILDING">local police lockup</span> , before those people were sent from there to a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And many, many, many years later, when I was working in the captured German records in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , one of the soldiers there came by to see me one day and said, Gerhard, didn’t you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I said yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He said, well here are the November 738 records on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And there was the arrest list, with my father’s name on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But, as I said, he was very fortunate in this regard, that a man who didn’t like him, and didn’t want him in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , still would get him sprung from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And that meant that he di — was not sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Do you know which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> your uncle was taken to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  H-He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Did he ever talk about that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  He was there for several months, and then, under circumstances similar to ours, went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with his wife and kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And when I si — was back in Europe for — for the first time again in ’62, I asked him not about there, but I — he was in the army, of course, in the first World War, and he was at the Battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verdun</span> , in 1916 on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I asked him — by this time I’m an associateMarch 13, 2012 professor of history — if he would talk to me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verdun</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And he said no, Gerhard, I won’t talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And the next time I’m in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , he has died in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He never really recovered fully from his months in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and I asked my aunt, his widow, and I — had he ever talked about Verdun’? </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And she said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And I asked her, well, did you ever ask him? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And she said yes, but there were two parts of his life he would never talk to me about; his time at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verdun</span> , and his months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So he would never — I — I never had the nerve to ask him about that, but I thought maybe by 1962, he would talk about 1916. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But that was something he would never talk about, and he was never quite the same after he was released around March, or thereabouts, o-of 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  You mentioned already a little bit, the preparations for emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">How did the decision to emigrate take shape in your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">When did your farents — parents first consider it? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Who first had the idea, or saw most clearly what had to be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Well, I think it came in a — if you will, in two stages. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I cannot give you the exact dates, but they started talking about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And in 19- fi — 35 - °36, and they were talking primarily about the three of us, that is my sister, brother and myself, on the assumption that there was no future for us in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And then, not much later, they began to realize that maybe they should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And by that time, some other members of th — our family, were — either had left, or were in the process of getting March 13, 2012 ready to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And a critical element in this were two individuals; a great-uncle of my mother’s, who had come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> around the turn of the century, had married and lived in — in this coun — in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , was a brilliant metallurgical engineer, made a fortune on his patents. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And used — saved it apparently, during the great depression, and used a lot of this money to help members of his family; brothers, sisters, cousins, all come a — [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">In the 1920s, the older brother of my mother all decided to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and also came to this coun — the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , married here, and also then would play a part in helping people to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So, what it meant really, was that we had — I mean, their families and so on and so forth, that we had family in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , family is also whom family members in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had occasionally visited, as people once in a while did, not as often as they do now flying, but in those days by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and once in a while visited, so that the idea of another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where there was family, seemed a little bit more plausible, I think it would be fair to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And so when my parents applied for what in those days were quota numbers, to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and as I said, started us on English lessons, on the assumption that this is the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> we would — the three of us would eventually grow up 1n, and this all then obviously changed in the more dramatic and urgent way, after November 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  How’s — how — can you say something about the process of a — obtaining these — these numbers, and of obtaining a visa? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">How strenuous was that process?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  It was extremely strenuous, because you had to have someone who would promise to support you for the rest of your life, after the German government had taken just about everything you had, so you would expect to arrive, essentially, financially as a pauper in another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , during the Great Depression, when the welfare systems of all <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> were about as strained as they could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But somebody had to promise and show that they could honor the promise, that they would support you for the rest of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We were very fortunate that — that we had this great-uncle — or ma — my mother’s uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And if you didn’t have that, there were a few instances, but not in my family, where an organization, a char — Jewish charitable organization might find a way of providing what was called an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That is to say a commitment. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We would say today, a commitment is necessary for lifetime support, because of course, the people who were coming out, and were trying to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , like my parents, and my aunt and uncle, and so on, didn’t know German, and had, in many instances, no training for a readily transferrable kind of job into a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where there were millions of jobless anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And of course my father’s legal training was irrelevant to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because it was, like most euro— <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — like most European continentsMarch 13, 2012 had Roman law, not common law basis, so that his doctorate was nice for a title in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but hopelessly useless in the — in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So what it was really that you had to get these affidavits, go through endless amounts of paperwork, which needless to say, either my uncle, or my great-uncle and my parents did, not us kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And then you had to apply, and eventually you would get a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And a certain proportion of these numbers would be called up each year, and then you could, in fact, go through the emigration procedure at the German end, and that’s — is how this worked, but it was a very complicated, time consuming, expensive and chancy matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  When you first went to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , when did you depart?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  What happened was, that after the November pogrom, the British government was the only one on earth that changed its immigration rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It decided that people who were waiting to go somewheres else, whether that was the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or some other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , could do their waiting in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , if they could be supported there without trying to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> then, a batch of — a number of people in the — what they call the Friends, we would call the Quakers, went around to what the English call <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and we would call <span class="BUILDING">private boarding schools</span> , and asked them if they would take Jewish refugee children at reduced rates. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on the <span class="REGION">south coast</span> in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swanage</span> , which said, we’ llMarch 13, 2012 take two boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bournemouth</span> , which is also on the <span class="REGION">south coast</span> , not so far from there, which said, we’ll take a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So parents took the three of us, at the end of December 1938, and took us by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American ship</span> , and that went — that stopped at the Le Havre in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , before crossing the Atlantic to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And needless to say, the three of us got off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so that’s how we got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">My parents, at that point did not yet have their exit permits from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but they got them a few months later, and then also came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to wait for the time when our numbers would come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But of course, this was all in the background of the November pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And the part of that which really upset me the most was the burning of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I knew that people sometimes don’t like other people, and beat up on them, throw rocks at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I knew, bec — we tend to forget how much the first World War dominated thinking in the 1930s, still. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I knew that people killed each other in enormous numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And then somebody had shot and wounded my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">That people were angry at each other and did terrible things to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But to know — and that’s not nice, but that was a part of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But why would people, mad at God? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">A <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would be called a <span class="BUILDING">Gottes Haus</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">house of God</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And that people were so mad at God that they would burn down God’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That to me, as a 10March 13, 2012 year old, that just seemed more puzzling and awful than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">How — how — what did they think God had done to them, that they would burn down the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I suppose that was reinforced by the fact that, after I was kicked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I attended for a few weeks in November, early December of ’38, a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , which was the old <span class="BUILDING">Jewish building</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So that each day, when I went into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the ruins — I passed the <span class="DLF">ruins</span> , let me phrase it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But that was certainly the part of this all that seemed even more awful than what they did to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">How could people get mad enough at God to go about deliberately destroying God’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="234">That — that just did not seem to fit with anything that I had ever heard, experienced, or thought about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  When did you first go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  I was back there very briefly, only for a few hours in ’62.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  What did you do, during those few hours?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Oh, I just kind of looked around, and went back to the <span class="DLF">street</span> where we had lived, and burst out laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I burst out laughing because in these row <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on both sides of the <span class="DLF">street</span> in that <span class="DLF">block</span> , every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was obviously a postwar reconstruction, except the one we’d lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I’ve often kidded, you see, that the British area bombing was much more careful than people have ever been willing to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> they didn’t hit, was the one that we had lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">IMarch 13, 2012 didn’t go in, I wasn’t gonna bother anybody, but I just — I just could not help cracking up, and standing across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , laughing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  What happened to your family’s assets; [indecipherable] <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , household items? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Could you bring anything, could the — your parents bring anything, or was everything confiscated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The rules on this changed steadily during the 30s and early 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">That meant that when my parents were leaving in early ’39, it was whatever rules applied then. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">You could take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and my parents were able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">You had them packed in what was called a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> , a huge crate that would then be shipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Some of our pictures they could take, but the most valuable one, an Ostade, was confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You could take a certain amount of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And other parts of clothing, do not ask me why, they could not take. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Many years later, about a little over a decade ago, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> to get a — they wanted to give me an honorary degree, and there, one of the faculty member that had graduate students studying the records of the <span class="BUILDING">local finance office</span> on the persecution of Jewish families there. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And they Xeroxed for me the file on my family, including the records of the number of pieces of underwear my mother had been allowed to take, and not take. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Obviously, in November, in late °38 - °39, folks in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had nothing else to do but to type up lists of clothing items, and pots and pans and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And as I said, these very March 13, 2012 kind people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> gave me copies of these documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">As to what, under the then existing rules, my parents had been allowed to take with them, and things they had not. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And the part that was in a — in its own weird way, particularly conspicuous in this regard was that families of the kind of social status that my parents were in, who would have a silver service of knives, forks, spoons and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And the rule at the time was that you could take with you out of what was usually a dozen fish forks, and a dozen teaspoons and whatnot, you could take one for each member of the family and two for guests. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So, since we were five, my parents and the three of us, that meant, higher arithmetic, seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So out of each dozen pieces of silverware, quite literally, they took five and kept them, and my parents were allowed to pack up seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And all of those things were put into this huge crate, literally, a — a lift. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">That was then shipped, at their expense, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and my — this uncle whom I mentioned before, my mother’s older brother, paid for storage here, until eventually we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and then that was unpacked, and was our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  We —- we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> all of 1939, and until September of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I was in this — my brother and I were in this <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> all of ’39, and then in the summer of 1940, our quota numbers came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So in July, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="268">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  And how was your life at the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  That was a — that was a wa - literally wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It’s there that, obviously my English improved immensely quickly, since nobody there spoke a word of German. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We not only learned English, but we had to start learning French and Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And to the amusement of fellow students at lunch or dinnertime, I would occasionally ask for the — something in the wrong language. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But the kids were friendly and nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The headmaster was great, who taught some classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">The two teachers — other teachers were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And that’s when, at the ripe age of 11, I decided that that’s what I’m gonna do. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I decided I was going to be a teacher, and never changed my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">It was a very, very good experience, and my brother and I, although the only Jewish kids in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , were not as extraordinary as might have seemed, because what we forget is that in those days, when there was still a British empire, families around the empire would send their kids to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to one of these <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where Bert and I were, there was a—a youngster whose parents were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">There were two boys whose father was, you know, a high government official in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">There was one boy — and of course, this is all boys, this is all gender segregated — one boy whose family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tangier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And one boy who was very important in this regard, whose family was in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And his talk about tigers and elephants and whatnot, was considerably more March 13, 2012 exotic than anything that had happened to my brother and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So, the notion of someone from elsewhere, let me phrase it that way, was much more a normal part of life in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like this, and I suspect other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , than one might, at first sight, expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And so, that worked out well. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Then, of course, came the defeat of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And we got to watch some of the Battle of Britain overhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And a huge sense, obviously these — there were several — Swanage had two industries. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">One was <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span> on the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , lovely <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But that was all covered with barbed wire against a German invasion at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And the other was, there was a ver — considerable number of these <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">private boarding schools</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And that obviously, the German air force thought it was an important target, and they dropped a huge one into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but fortunately, it didn’t go off, or I wouldn’t be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So we spent a lot of time in the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And then, when in July, it — we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I lived with an aunt and uncle there, and my brother lived with his grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">That, of course, was the beginning of the blitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So we got to spend time in an <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  What was your — the experience of your parents in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  My parents decided that while they were waiting for the quota numbers to come up, they would live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bournemouth</span> , in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so that Laura, my sister, who was by herself obviously, could be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">In May - June of 1940, the March 13, 2012 British government got hysterical about a possible fifth column, and proceeded to an internment and dispersal policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">What they did was, intern the men over a certain age, I believe it was 15 or 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So my father was interned. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">My brother and I were not, because we were under the age limit. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And the women about that age could not live within 50 miles of the <span class="DLF">coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Which meant that my mother and sister had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bournemouth</span> , and they were presumably less dangerous in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bournemouth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Do not ask me to explain why or how. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But in any case, they then went to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and my sister, in fact, went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And Dad was, as I said, first interned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litchfield</span> , and then sent to the Isle of Man. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And Mother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and my sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , until, in the summer of 1940, our quota numbers came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And then, first the four of us, that is the — the mother and us three kids, were processed. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And then what the British did was bring a batch of men, whose families and whose numbers were all lined up, brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to go through the procedures. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And so, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> , from which we — where we were to get our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , the families were reunited, so to speak, when they got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and got onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  So for how long did your mother not see her husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Well, she got to wave to him when he was processed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , cause we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grosvenor Square</span> to see — and that would have been about three, four months.</span><span class="sentence" id="315">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  So you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , September 1940, correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And where did you first stay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  We first stayed with this uncle and his wife, my aunt, and their three children in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And my parents had to decide where to live in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Because the dad had been shot through the arm, he could not drive, and originally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , we had had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for a while, before Jews were prohibited from driving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and Mother drove. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Which in those days, for the woman to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was very unusual in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But Dad, because of his bad right arm, couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They then borrowed — the family then lent them a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and Mother drove a little bit around <span class="REGION">New York state</span> and nearby <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And they decided to settle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , which is about 150 miles north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , so they weren’t that far away from others in the family, but they didn’t want to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> had the reputation as having good <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , which with three kids headed for <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , it was, of course, a concern of some importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, in December of 1940, we moved into a <span class="BUILDING">rented house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The lift with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , etcetera, was unpacked, and we then lived there, and continued to live there and go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And after some years, my parents moved to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But Dad lived out his life there, and Mother, well she had to be in a specialMarch 13, 2012 <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a while, lived out — they lived out their lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And my brother lives in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> with his wife today. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And it was there that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  Was it an issue among your schoolmates that you were a Jewish refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was that an issue at all, in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The only thing that was — that my schoolmates found strange, was first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scarsdale</span> , when I first came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and then the first few months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> was my English accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Because of course, I spoke English with an English accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And that was, in a way, for my fellow students, more peculiar, if you will, than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And over a period of not that long time, my English accent evaporated, and got replaced by what I guess you would call a standard New York type of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Did you see yourself as part of a network of German-Jewish immigrants in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  Ina small way, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">There were several other Jewish refugee families, as they call themselves, in the <span class="REGION">Albany area</span> , and my parents and we associated, or would see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And one of them, in fact, benefited in an ironic way, from what I’ve always thought was the only good thing that happened in November 738. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And that is, my family had insisted that I take violin lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And those ended in November March 13, 2012 °38, and that’s just as well, because as you must know, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there is a constitutional bar on cruel and unusual punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And I would not want anybody to have to listen to me playing a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">When the lift was packed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> in °39, my parents, for reasons I don’t understand, packed the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And it turned out that one of the refugee families in the <span class="REGION">Albany area</span> had a daughter who wanted to play the violin, but they couldn’t afford one. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And with considerable pleasure on my part, my parents gave them the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But that was, if you will, in the — 1n the <span class="REGION">family area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And what also happened was after the war, when the German government began to — west German government began to pass restitution laws, my father, who had, at one time helped people find out what they could take out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , now provided free advice for — to people on a — what they were entitled to under these very complicated rules, that the ordinary refugee family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upstate New York</span> didn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But given his background and training, this was something that Dad understood very well, so he would help, without charging them — people in the <span class="REGION">Albany area</span> and some other nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , on what they were entitled to under the restitution laws, and th — especially in the 1950s, early 60s, as refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Do you remember any other immigrant children who were — who were classmates or playmates? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Any names coming up? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">March 13, 2012
ANSWER:  N-No. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">There is the sad part, you see, that my best friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> was the son of this couple who lived with us, and he was killed, along with his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Horst. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And the only other Jewish boy in my class, who was kicked out with me at the same time, on the same morning, in November 738, that was a family that we were not in touch with, so I have no idea, frankly, what happened to him, and whether he got out, or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The only person that we sort of kept in a certain amount of contact with was, that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> that I mentioned, they took another Jewish refugee boy, who is now retired as a surgeon, living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Monica</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we have sort of kept a little bit, and — especially my brother, in touch with this man, as he left je — <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , grew up, married, raised a family here, as I said, on the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Now — but o-otherwise that just simply did not occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  And was there anything that you found curious about life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Anything that you felt you had to adjust to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Well, obviously, at first I thought the people in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> spoke a very unusual form of English, for which I had to adjust and adapt over a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I had never eaten corn on the cob. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">In those days, corn in — or maize, as they call it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , is only used as animal feed. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And what we call sweet corn, was in those days, completely unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And so, when I first was presented with this contraption, of March 13, 2012 which to eat, I must say I was slightly puzzled, until I watched other people in the family, who knew how to cope with this particular vegetable. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And there were a couple of other vegetables that were simply knew to us, broccoli for one. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">But that was a little easier to get used to than corn on the cob. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It so happened that when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in September, as I mentioned, in October, of course, came Halloween. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And we went with the kids of my aunt and uncle, and the idea of going around collecting candy was, I thought, a rather unusual habit, but one that I easily approved of. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The one other thing that at first, again, was odd, was that a couple of times, my aunt would come to wake me up in the morning, and discover, to her horror that was lying under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And of course what had happened was that during the night, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">police car</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> had been in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I had heard a siren, and when you hear a siren, that means an air raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I had automatically gotten under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But I got over that, just as I learned to eat corn on the cob, and quite like it now, I got over being accustomed to hearing a siren not meaning an air raid, but meaning that there is an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> going by, or the police is chasing a—a traffic violation, o-or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Those things did, I must admit, seem at first a little different to me, but they’re not the sort of things that, as a youngster, take very long to get used to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  Were you ever homesick? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Did you have a feeling of — of loss?March 13, 2012
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  [indecipherable] had to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  No, I really did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">My pet white mouse died just before we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , and the last experiences and the events there were so unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The way I was kicked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you see, was particularly unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The headmaster came into the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , read the announcement, and one other boy and I got up, picked up our things and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I repressed that memory until I was reminded of it at this ceremony when I got my honorary degree, and the two of my former schoolmates were there, and told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But that — that — no, I wa — there was a certain curiosity, which is why, as I told you, in ’62, I— I went back, just to see what the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And then I was there again in ’83, when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for quite a while, and I have since been back there to lecture and received an honorary degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But there was never any sense that this was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I had lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">After all, they had kicked me out, rather emphatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And so there was never a — a — a-any sense of an — at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> , and remained that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  Well, and — do you remember where you were on December 7", 1941?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I had made very good friends with a local boy who was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me in junior high school in the ninth grade, and — and was in the same <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , Jimmy Lawson. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And we made it a habit to meet on Sunday afternoon, listen to the March 13, 2012 Metropolitan opera while playing chess. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And on December 7" — we took turns at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We were at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> playing chess, listening to the Metropolitan Opera, when that was interrupted with the announcement that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was at war. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So that was a — a somewhat dramatic event that I remember rather clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The other side of this was, you see, that when we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in September 1940, the striking thing was coming from a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> all blacked out, to one where the — they were — everything was lit up. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Cause the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> stayed in the outside part of <span class="DLF">New York harbor</span> overnight, before pulling in to the <span class="DLF">pier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we hadn't seen a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with lights for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">A year and nine months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Do you need a break?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  No, I’m okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  Okay, great. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Well, let’s — let’s move onto wartime then. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">You were too young to serve at the time, but you nonetheless served after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">You were drafted into the U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Do you want to talk about your experiences, what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Yes, the — the rule at the time that we’re talking about was that you registered for the draft, and were pulled in when you were 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Well, which went that my older brother, of course, was already in, a year and a half older. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">When I got to be 18, and was drafted, and took my basic training in what was then called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Polk</span> , andMarch 13, 2012 now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Polk</span> in <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Then, after that, when was — had a few days at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Stoneman</span> which is in <span class="REGION">California</span> , near <span class="BUILDING">Oakland Army base</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I was then shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">In <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> I first spent some months assigned to depot supply of the fourth <span class="BUILDING">replacement depot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And by being one of two people in emergency supply, things that they needed, or had to get rid of, it meant being the G.I. on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck convoys</span> , otherwise driven and manned by veterans of the Imperial Japanese Army working for the Americans, either picking up or delivering things, and that got me a—a good look at the central part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Honshu</span> , the largest of the <span class="REGION">Japanese home islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And I was very interested in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I’d taken a course in Japanese history in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> before I was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And in the process of doing this, discovered that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span> , where <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> Eighth Army was, the occupation army, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I, one day, had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> convoy stop outside the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and went in and talked to the administrator, and this [indecipherable] lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I had worked it out so that by the time I was drafted, I had three years of <span class="BUILDING">teachers’ college</span> behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And I asked, did they need any teachers? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And she said, oh yeah, we certainly do, because they’re being rotated <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Ill take you to see the head of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Major Dwight. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Major Dwight was very interested in ha — getting me, but explained that he could not order a transfer, that I would have to ask the major in charge of supply at the fourth <span class="BUILDING">replacement depot</span> ifMarch 13, 2012 he would let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And I asked, and the major said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So the rest of the time that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , in the army of occupation, I was in information and education section of <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> Eighth Army; teaching G.I.s in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span> a — Peace Corps, teaching American government, teaching American history, and then after a couple months, I’m also teaching some literacy classes for G.I.s who needed to learn how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And then in ’47, when the American army decided to get rid of its draftees, that is, until the Korean war. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Nobody knew the Korean war was coming, but what I meant is that in that period of time, they had enough regular army people, so I was discharged honorably, having in the meantime acquired two stripes in the army, and went back to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Since, as I mentioned before, I wanted to be a teacher, I was very fortunate that my parents picked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> , in which there was what was then called New York State College for Teachers, Albany, now the State University of New York at Albany. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I enrolled there, on the assumption that I was going to teach <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> social studies and Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And I took classes there, and because — this is, the war is on, I started there in January of ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And just as they had had in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , a program where you could do your senior year in half a year, which I had done, accelerated, so that young men could get as much in before they had to go inMarch 13, 2012 the army, as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They also had an acceleration program in the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , where you could take 10 hours in the summer, and 18 each semester, credit hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So I had, with this combination, living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> there, and various part time jobs, to help the family and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So that when I was drafted, I had, as I said, three years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">When I — during my time in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span> , the army had a program where you could take certain classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I did that, and I got six hours credit when I came out of the army, and went back in ’47, in the summer, and in the fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So that although my diploma didn’t come til June of ’48, in fact, I finished my four years in January, took a semester and a summer session in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> , and then went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> for graduate work, because by this time, the G.I. bill led me to think of the possibility, not of teaching secondary school, as I had originally planned, and I had done my practice teaching in the ninth grade, but the possibility of getting a PhD and going into college teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And for that, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Right, and you earned your PhD in 1951, your doctoral advisor was Hans Rothfels. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Can you tell us a bit more about your work with Rothfels? </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Did it matter that you were both immigrants from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  Well, actually, what happened was, when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , my plan had been to work on the diplomatic history of the late 19" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I was interested in howMarch 13, 2012 the Europeans got themselves into the horrors of the first World War, not so much the final crisis, but the 1860s, 70s, 80s, 90s, how they got organized in a way that led them to disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And so I wrote my first seminar paper on the crisis of a — eastern crisis of 1876. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But I discovered very quickly in working with ro — listening to Rothfels in the <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> , and working with him, that his views of this [indecipherable] were the opposite of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Since I could not afford to change <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , I changed centuries, and worked with him on 20" century diplomacy, rather than 19" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And out of that came not only my shift to 20" century, but a very important development that would affect my life thereafter, into today, in a rather unexpected way. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">When I wrote a seminar paper for Rothfels, it was not on 1876, it was on the May Crisis in German and Czech relations of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And at the time that we’re talking about, 1949 - 50, the first volumes of the documents on German foreign policy were coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">These were edited volumes of captured German diplomatic documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And in the volume that dealt with the May Crisis of 1938, they had inserted not only German foreign ministry documents, but a number of military documents, concerning invasion plans and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And, because I was working on my Master’s thesis already, and had decided to do them on German-Soviet relations in the nonaggression pact, °39 to ’41, I was unpacking the huge collection of Nuremberg documents that the <span class="BUILDING">law library</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> had March 13, 2012 acquired, and which is now the big collection of the center for <span class="BUILDING">research libraries</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I discovered very quickly, that at least in my opinion, the people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , who were putting these volumes together were making mistakes with the military documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And in the footnotes to my seminar paper, at the appropriate points, mentioned these. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Rothfels, after returning the seminar paper to me, called me into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and said that I should pull these all together and look for any others, and prepare a critical note on these volumes for the “Journal of Modern History,” one of the professional journals in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , that is edited in and produced by the history department at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Needless to say, I did what Rothfels had told me to do, and wrote, and then the “Journal of Modern History” published in March of *51, a critical note on the documents on German foreign policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">At the time, as I was going towards the finishing of my PhD dissertation on the subject of German-Soviet relations, academic jobs in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> were practically nonexistent, because faculties everywhere were shrinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">This was the only time in modern American history when enrollments were dropping and dropping quite drastically in higher education, as the G.I.s were finishing their education. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But I got a call — and so the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> had no leads, or I had no leads whatsoever for any job, until I got a letter from a Dr. Fritz Epstein, who was recruiting for a documents project in the German archives, and who had seen thisMarch 13, 2012 critical note. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I did not know at the time, that he was, in fact, one of the people that I was criticizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But he read that, and he wrote to me and explained that he was recruiting staff for a documents program. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He was flying to the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Would I meet him at <span class="BUILDING">Midway airport</span> , between <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , and we’d talk? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Needless to say, I was very interested in meeting him at <span class="BUILDING">Midway airport</span> , which under the circumstances seemed appropriate, since it’s named for one of the critical battles of the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And he and I started talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And he was so interested, and I was so fascinated, that he decided to take a later <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> than the one he was booked for. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We spent hour — literally several hours just sitting, talking about documents and about the new edition which had just come out, by the do — of the Hitler table talk, and on all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And we got through later, I got an offer of a job on the war documentation project. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Needless to say, I accepted, and after defending the dissertation in August of °51, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , where the records were. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But it was essentially the suggestion that Rothfels had made, for me to do this, that got me into the — that job in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The only other interesting contact that I had was, that he was the only faculty member in my three years at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , who at one point had a group of us, myself included, graduate students, at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , at his <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And all — at that — on that occasion, his wife told me what had happened to him in November of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">He was — he — the — both Rothfels and his wife were March 13, 2012 very devout Lutherans, but the family background was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They came to collect him in November ’38, and his wife explained that he was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">He’d lost a leg in November in 1914 on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> , and his prosthesis was being repaired. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And the men who came to pick him up said, well, we’ll be back in half an hour — this is what she — what she told me, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> , and they did come back half an hour later with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> , and took him to the local police lock up. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And the sergeant in charge had been in Rothfels company in November 1914, and told the two men to take him out the back and take him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Soon thereafter he moved to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and ended up in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> as my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Came from there then to <span class="BUILDING">Brown University</span> for a short time, and from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So, that was the one time I was at their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and his wife told me this story about his rather unusual deliverance in November of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I was his research assistant for a quarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="486"><span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> , at least then, was on a quarter system, not a semester system. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And he was then beginning to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> semesters at a time, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tubingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So actually when I finished the PhD, he was not there, but I was, in effect, his last American PhD. And his classroom presence was in certain ways very — I think very influential for me, because he analyzed the students, and got students to look at ways which were unconventional in a way, compared to most of the textbooks, and the — I found that very challenging, and very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And March 13, 2012 perhaps that helped me a little bit later on when I was doing the teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And we stayed in touch, and I did go see him once in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before he died, in the 70s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  Was he ever happy at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Was he ever happy in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I mean, he did go back to a regular position. [</span><span class="sentence" id="494">indecipherable]
ANSWER:  It— it’s very hard for me to say, because he was not the kind of person to share his views and attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I have no doubt that he was very pleased to have a decent job, in a first rate <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I did not have the impression that he and the other members of the history department were on very close terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But, he continued to have at least a minimal tie to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> afterwards, and so — and he certainly had a succession of graduate students there, of whom I was chronologically the last, but certainly not the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And at least my predecessor in this situation Phil Wolfson, also played a larger role, and I a very minor role in the research that he did on the German opposition to Hitler, on which he produced the first important book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  Well, let’s move onto your early career. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">You mentioned already the war documentation project that Epstein recruited you for. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Could you explain what that was, and what that work entailed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  The American air force, and offi - Human Resources Research Institute at Maxwell Air Force Base in <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> , have made a contract with the Bureau forMarch 13, 2012 Applied Social Research of Columbia University, to do some exploring in the captured German records that had been brought to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">My work on this was physically located, if you will, in the old <span class="BUILDING">torpedo factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">This is a set of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> crea — built in the first World War, for the making of <span class="DLF">mines</span> and torpedoes that could be loaded directly onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Potomac River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">In the second World War, it was the place where the American army deposited its World War II records, temporarily at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And a portion of this was called the German Military Document Section, GMDS, where the captured German records were. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">To begin with, I was asked to do something slightly different, actually, than research in those records. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">At the time we’re talking about now, *51 - °52 and thereafter, the captured records in American government custody, were all secured and classified. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And we had to have a clearance to work there, in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But there were already substantial numbers of German captured records that one way or another, had ended up in all kinds of <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And in order to have some sense of what was going on, it seemed important to get some idea of what was where. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And so, my first job really, was preparing what came to be my first book, the “Guide to Captured German Documents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Which was partly inventory, partly book listing of captured German records that had ended up in the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> , in the National Archives, in the Institute for Jewish Affairs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> March 13, 2012 City, in depositories elsewheres in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And in fact that also meant that in the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> , where there was lots in the manuscript division, I was the one who got to organize these, and set them up, and try to organize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Thereafter, like the others, for the most part on the War Documentation Project, were on what was called, Project Alexander. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And Project Alexander was the very secret cover name for our research into Soviet partisans in World War I. There was an advisory committee on this, for this project, headed by Phil Moseley, Professor Phil Moseley of <span class="BUILDING">Harvard University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And what we were asked to do by the air force for them, obviously, they were paying for this, through Columbia, if you will, on a contract basis, was the — what — what was actually going on in the German occupied portions of the Soviet Union where there were all these guerillas? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And the general — the decision as we worked on this was, using the German records that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , we decided to have two kinds of studies; topical and regional. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I got to do the topical study, on the role of air power in partisan warfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Needless to say, our air force was very interested in that study on how the Soviets used air power in support of partisan warfare, and how the Germans used air power in fighting partisan warfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And I found that very interesting in studying the relevant records, insofar as they were available. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And many, many, many, many we — decades later, in 2005, noticed when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> , and theirMarch 13, 2012 <span class="BUILDING">outdoor museum</span> , World War II museum, they had what they call a decoder. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">DC3</span> , one of the many that we had provi — the United States provided to the Russians under [indecipherable] and which was the key <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> in Soviet support of partisan warfare, for flying in supplies, flying out wounded, bringing in officers and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But they had one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> that I had written about, on display for me to look at in the original. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">The regional study that I was to make, was of the Yelnya-Dorogobuzh area in the <span class="REGION">Smolensk Oblast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And that proved very interesting, because it’s really about the only anti-partisan campaign the Germans ever had in World War II that was, from their point of view, successful, as opposed to all the other anti-partisan campaigns that my colleagues worked on, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bryansk</span> , o-on other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> , on the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , on the <span class="REGION">Caucasus</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And then we had specialized on psychological warfare, and partisan warfare and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And then these studies were published in classified form originally, by the air force, after they published my guide to captured German documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And then they were declassified. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And then one of the scholars who worked there, on the war documentation project, the — John Armstrong, who made his career in the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madison</span> , sort of edited them into one big book. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And the other project that I then did, was to publish in English, captured partisan documents that the Germans had either seized from groups, or picked up March 13, 2012 from dead partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And I published th — I mean, the air force published a big book of mine, “Selected Soviet Documents on the Partisan Movement.” </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I also did a collection of Soviet partisan diaries that the Germans had seized. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But for reasons which I don’t understand, the air force never published that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So that exists, this collection of diaries exists, if it does anywhere, only in unpublished form. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">When Professor Armstrong published this big book that Wisconsin published, “Soviet Partisans in World War II,” he added a number of these specialized studies, his own survey of the whole partisan movement and very substantial portions of my book of selected Soviet sources, but no part is my ri— remember, of the unpublished collection of partisan diaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Before I left the project in ’54, there were also — they were beginning to assign us some other specialized studies in this <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">While I was working on the Soviet sources on the partisan movement, one of my colleagues, Eric Waldman, was doing one on the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — German locally recruited police, the Ordnungspolizei, and another member, Alexander Dallin, was doing a study which was published, on the Romanian occupied portion of the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">That is to say, after the Germans and Romanians invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in ’41, the Germans turned over to the Romanian government, a substantial portion of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> to administer. </span><span class="sentence" id="540"><span class="REGION">Transnistria</span> , it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And Dallin was assigned to do a study of March 13, 2012 what happened in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And there were probably others, but by that time, I had left the project.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  Which other historians, or later historians did you meet at the war documentation project? </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You mentioned already Dallin, you mentioned Armstrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  Okay, I mentioned Eric — Eric Waldman, whose later career was in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Willie Moll, whose later career was in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Very important was Raul Hilberg, who at that point in time, unlike the rest of us, had not yet finished his PhD dissertation, but did so, in effect, at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> , while working in part — full time with us in the war documentation project, and who subsequently went on to a career most of his life at verm — <span class="BUILDING">University of Vermont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Another person was Earl Ziemke, who went from the war documentation project, a year or two after I did, to the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the chief of military history, and published a number of very important books while there. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And then moved to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Georgia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> , and published some more important books from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There were a couple others who did not — I mean, who went on with their lives and careers, but did not play that important and professional role, as Ziemke and Armstrong and Hilberg did. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  And — and when you describe about the atmosphere there, in the <span class="BUILDING">torpedo factory</span> , I mean how was it like to be the first to see these documents? </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I mean, how did you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Well, it was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">You got a sense of discovery that you couldn’t get elsewhere, because while obviously some intelligence specialists and other had pawed through some of this stuff, mo-most of it you were looking at for the first time, and — and that could really be quite exciting and interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I never forget we sta — for reasons I cannot now tell you, we — we — one of the collections that I was set on early, was the [speaks German], the Reichs commissioner for strengthening Germandom(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And there they were the files on the individual German military leaders, who expected to acquire huge <span class="DLF">estates</span> in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And I never forget the [indecipherable] who spent, after he was canned, temp — on — in the winter of ’41 - °42, and spent his time riding around <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , looking for an <span class="DLF">estate</span> that the government would steal for him before he returned to active duty in the spring of °43. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And they eventually gave him one, that is, that they stole from the Poles, that was worth, he thought an inadequate one and a quarter million marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And he was very unhappy that they didn’t steal a bigger one for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It gave me a kind of insight into the German military of World War II, that I had, I must admit, not had up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And the whole business — I mean, I discovered later, and — when I March 13, 2012 was working in the federal archiving [indecipherable] the files on the bribery of all of these top officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But I must say, I was somewhat surprised, shall we say? </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And it was also interesting to — just to see the differences in local handling of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">That is to say that 1t— one German division would operate one way, and another division 20 miles away would operate somewhat differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">That is to say the extent to which local initiatives and different approaches to issues, 1n what people refer to as a totalitarian society, but in which there was more differentiation, if you will, at the local level than one might originally have anticipated. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The other thing that really hit me was that — how the horror invaded everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">The welfare organizations end up with corpses that they don’t know what to do with, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And the party organizations and welfare organizations are deciding whom to let starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">The — it’s not somehow a segregated, carefully compartmentalized portion, the evil part, but rather, it’s sort of pervasive. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And that, I have to admit, came as something of a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">The other part of this that was interesting was that one could periodically help people, e1-either who were there and who needed help, or who came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I was able to help the ger — indirectly, the German scholar with whom I was working on a biography of one of the key figures of the German resistance to Hitler, get some records declassified so that he could use them, since they were still under security classification, in a blanket way. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">A key figure of theMarch 13, 2012 German resistance came to visit there. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">A man by the name of Gisevius, whose book, “To the Bitter End” is rather well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I got to meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And then he asked me for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">He wanted to have Xerox copies o-of those parts of the police reports that mentioned him. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And they had explained to him that th — he couldn’t have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I went to ask, well what — why can’t he have them? </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And it turned out to be very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They could lend and make photocopies for government agencies, but they had no way of taking money from anybody to buy anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So we arranged for them to lend them to the photo duplication section of the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> , which they could do, and the people there could, of course, sell Gisevius photocopies of the documents he was interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And there were other such things where one could occasionally assist somebody o-out of simply no — working in this wa — what we refer to, since it was not air conditioned in the summer, the black hole of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calcutta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Because you’re there on the Potomac, humidity is very high, and no air conditioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It — it was not physically very pleasant, but the army people were very helpful, and so it was an intriguing way to begin working in the profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And after two one year teaching positions, you were hired again, to work with the captured German records. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">This was in 1956, and the assignment was to microfilm all — captured German records before they were returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">March 13, 2012 And this project was under the auspices of the American Historical Association, went on for several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Could you talk about this project, and what your role was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  What happened was this: when the — the governments of — of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> , and they each — they jointly controlled, and there was a British representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , as there was an American one in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , decided to start sending the records <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , under an arrangement of their being American records. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And if you want, I’ll explain how that came to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">But people then became scholars in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , became very alarmed that — how could we assure access to these records, after they were back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And a group of scholars operating privately and independently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , got together and set up a committee for the study of war documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">They got money from the Ford Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They had a meeting with government officials, in the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> , with Verner Clapp, who was then the deputy librarian of Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I was invited to this meeting, from <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , where I was then teaching [coughs] Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I suspect on Fritz Epstein’s recommendation. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And it was agreed that we would try to film, with the army’s agreement, cooperation, as the records were declassified, so that there would be this sequence, declassification, microfilming, return to the federal republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The American Historical Association, and the Ford Foundation agreedMarch 13, 2012 that the hand — the financial handling would be through the AHA. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And then subsequently, after the Ford Foundation money ran out — excuse me [coughing] da — Lillian Dowman(ph) put up money for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And then, the Old Dominion Foundation paid for many years of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">But the money went through the American Historical Association, and this independent committee became the committee on war documents of the AHA. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I was ha — hired by the AHA in the technical sense then, to be the first director, and had the money to hire one professional, and one secretarial assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And to pay for one person who was a micro-photographer, but who was, in effect, provided by the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So, in May of ’56, I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and set up this program, and the policies for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And han — at the beginning, very important decisions and influences to consider. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I had managed to persuade the committee to put the microfilms that we were going to make, into the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> , not the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I was persuaded by — or indoctrinated perhaps is the best term, by the head of exhibits and publications of the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> , a man by the name of Lysinger(ph), that it was a mistake to film selectively. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And I fell in with this very, very quickly, because I had been using, in the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> , for my own research, some of the microfilm the State Department had deposited there from the foreign office microfilm. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And whatever they thought they were doing in [indecipherable] <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , it was editing, and it always March 13, 2012 meant that the same German file either didn’t get filmed at all, or got filmed in bits and pieces on different rolls of microfilm, sometimes as many as six. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And then eventually, if you wanted to make sure you had everything, you’d have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and look at the original file, which in fact I ended up doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Furthermore, as Lysinger(ph) explained to me that there were two other reasons to film, occasionally selectively, but generally throughout, was that you spend your money on filming, not on selecting, which meant that you could produce much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And there’s no question that this helped us sustain the program, because as Professor Hale(ph), who was the third head of the committee, but headed it longer than anybody else, told me that if you go to a foundation for microfilm, they’re not much interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But if you can tell them that for 30 or 35,000 dollars a year, you can turn a million frames into the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> , they are somewhat more interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The other thing that Lysinger(ph) explained to me, that I was barely conscious of from my earlier work with the Nuremberg material, was that of course, all governments in World War II, used the poorest paper possible, because they wanted to use their resources for things which were a lot more important than requisitions for paper clips. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And therefore, we needed to film, in part for access, to be sure, which was the original concept of the committee; that American, German, British, any other scholars could have acc — could be guaranteed access. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But that we were March 13, 2012 also filming for preservation. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And having seen some of the Nuremberg mimeographed stuff starting to crumble, I did not take much indoctrination. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But, as I said, Lysinger(ph) really put these things to me in a way so that I — when I set this whole thing up, we did a teeny bit of selective, but mostly filming throughout, and that then continued thereafter, long after I was out of it on the — teaching in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> or in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But that meant in that — that it was afterwards possible for the army and the project to cooperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">When the army started putting money in, especially for the filming of the military records, they would contract with a micor — with a — for the microfilming, and the committee’s professional people would do the descriptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So that when it was all over, of the material that was at one time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , let me put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Somewheres between 90 and 95 percent was film. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">The material that was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , at least 85 percent, and probably 90 percent went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> un-filmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And I remain convinced of the importance of this, and I have to say I have become more convinced in recent years, of the importance of filming throughout, because while lots of people are increasingly thinking about what to do about the fact that the Holocaust survivors are either dead or not going to be with us very much longer, the papers, the records of the Holocaust era, are disappearing too. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Either physically, for the paper, or electronically if they’re electronic records. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So that in 50 years or a hundred years March 13, 2012 from now, not only will there be no human witnesses of those terrible events, any paper, or any electronic records will be either gone, or inaccessible. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So on this particular side of the issue, I have become, if you will, more convinced of the necessity of total reproduction, either in microfilm, or in high density engraving on plates, than I was when we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And the other policy that I insisted on at the beginning, and that to the best of my knowledge was followed for — through the rest of the project, was that where the western allies had not acquired what I would call the — the top level records — and the two examples that I recall very distinctly were the <span class="REGION">German labor front</span> , and the German welfare — the Nazi welfare organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">As a general policy, whatever was there should be filmed, so that people would have at least something from lower levels, that would give them some idea of what the — the policies and issues were. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And later on, when the army was beginning to run out of money for filming, I urged them, and I believe they followed, on a somewhat similar basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">That is to say, all the top level military records were filmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">But when they had to choose among the division records, after a while, I told them all the air force field divisions, whatever there is, all the security divisions, whatever there is. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Whatever the field training divisions, whatever there is, because there you — you were again dealing with an important subject, but only fragmentary surviving records. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  Yet, if you were to summarize, what did the microfilming project achieve? </span><span class="sentence" id="637">What does it mean for scholarship, just to get that idea across?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  Well, it means that there is access, now and into the future, of an enormous quantity of German records from the 1930s and 40s, on essentially all aspects of events, and that can be accessed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , that can be accessed elsewheres by either purchase or borrowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And that for one of the most dramatic areas of world history, and the largest war ever fought that we know about, and the horrendous catastrophe of the Holocaust, there are records that people who are interested can have access to, essentially today, without restrictions, and that they can make the most of. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And that there was no opportunity, as there was after the first World War, for the postwar German government to restrict access, even if it wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I’m not suggesting that with certain exceptions, the German postwar government has wanted to, but needless to say, in the 1950s, nobody knew this, and we were looking at the past experience, which people had, as opposed to the future experience, which for very good reasons, people hadn't had yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And there was one other aspect to this that I think 1s important, and that is, it created, if you will, a kind of precedent. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Why keep the records of <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> X closed, if those of <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> Y are open and accessible? </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Why not open American records for the period on which the German records are open? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So that there is, if you will, a — a—a certain impetus, if March 13, 2012 you will, that the declassification, and then microfilming of German records has had for the opening of other records. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">There is one final point that’s closely related to this, I would argue, and that is that those who might have preferred closure of German records in postwar Germany, realistically didn’t have a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And the dramatic example of this that I would site, is the German scholar Derscha(ph), who wanted access to some personnel records of the German foreign ministry, which were denied to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And who then discovered that they were on microfilm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The — the possibilities, in other words, and the temptations simply haven’t been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And while I don’t want this to be read as a general attack, cause as I said, the — the German government of federal republic was on the whole, very cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">There was never much of a temptation to go in another direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">One of your major publications after the dissertation is related to your work with the captured records, you published Hitler’s second book. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Republished it in German, with a German publisher in 1961. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">What is this second book? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">What is the story behind this peculiar document?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  In the 19 later 50s and 60s, I was working on the origins of the second World War and German foreign policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">In the process I saw a couple of references to Hitler having dictated another book. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I was back teaching, first at Kentucky, then at Michigan. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">But in the summer of ’58, I went back to assist my successor as directorMarch 13, 2012 of the project, Dr. Dagmar Perman, and was going through piles of stuff to describe and set up for microfilming and came across this one sheaf, it’s around 300 pages of typescript, which was labeled as a draft, or partial draft of “Mein Kampf.” </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And when I started reading it, it was perfectly obvious this is no draft of “Mein Kampf,” it’s clear from the <span class="DLF">opening lines</span> , literally, that this was a second book. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Not long after, two things happened, which made the publication possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">One was, that it turned out that back in °45, after this document was confiscated at the Nazi public party’s <span class="BUILDING">publishing house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> by the Americans, they had made a microfilm of it back in ’45, and provided it to the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And under those circumstances, the British representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> allowed me to have a copy made from their microfilm, so I could start working on preparing a text for publication. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I got subseq — abou — a few months later, a letter from Rothfels, who by this time was associated with the Institute for Contemporary History in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , that they had heard about this book, and he sent me the correspondence, and I wrote back and told him yes, I just found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And so, it seemed best to publish it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the Institute’s publication series. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And 1-it took a while, and there were problems with the Bavarian government, which was very hesitant and put a publication run limit on the print of the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And the, excuse me, Institute had to deal with the Hitler heirs, to make sure there weren’t going to be problems about the rights, which they bought for aMarch 13, 2012 few hundred marks from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And so then I put it out in 1961 in German, and it took me til 2003 to get a publisher to put it out in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  During the 70s and 80s, you were very much known as the specialist on Nazi foreign policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">You published two volumes, “The Foreign Policy of Hitler’s Germany,” and they’re still among the standard works on — on the topic. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Why did you choose the topic of Nazi foreign policy at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  I chose the topic because then, as I might add, still today, there is a new book on the origins of World War I every six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">But there didn’t seem to — there doesn’t seem to be similar interest in the origins of World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And while I have nothing against people studying the origins of World War I, having at one time myself thought of doing something on the diplomacy of the late 19 century, that set the stage for the first World War, it seemed to me preposterous that nobody had done anything similar, seriously looking at the origins of World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I was convinced, and I’m must — then, when I started on this, and remain convinced today, that after the experience of World War I, which was most unpleasant for all concerned, winners and losers, there was no one else on the face of the globe who was going to start another World War, than the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">It was true, and it happened, that local wars would be started by others. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">A civil war in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But that was a civil war. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The Italians were going to revenge their earlier defeat by the people of <span class="COUNTRY">Abyssinia</span> , andMarch 13, 2012 what you really had was the last of the great colonial wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The Japanese had fought one war with <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and one with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and now would fight another one with <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">There was always the possibility of another war in <span class="REGION">South America</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that had been at war repeatedly in the 19 century. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">There was always the possibility of some war between who knows, the Hungarians and the Romanians, who were always itching to do that, but fortunately didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">But starting another World War, nobody after 1918, other than possibly the Germans, were going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And so, I figured that since nobody else was doing anything seriously on the origins of World War II, the best way to do this was to organize it around the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the initiative came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And while there were people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the per — in the 1920s, who were thinking seriously of the possibility of maybe trying to take back some of the <span class="REGION">land</span> they’d been forced to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or — 0-or who knows what else, no one other than Hitler was thinking of anything bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And so, I decided that the way to organize an origins of World War II book, was around German foreign policy after 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And aster — after I had gotten into it for a while, it became clear to me, and by discussion with a man who was doing this from the <span class="REGION">institutional side</span> , whom I got to know, Professor [indecipherable] Jacobson(ph), that I’d best do this in two books, rather than one. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Now, they are now available inMarch 13, 2012 one book, but I’m talking about when I was doing them, at the time, so out of this came the two books on Hitler’s foreign policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  From our perspective, 2012, do you think that Nazi foreign policy and international diplomacy during the 1930s are topics still worth exploring, or have they run their course?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  Well, there is now, ironically it appeared last year, what literally one other book in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and this was the British historian Zara Steiner, who had written the book, “The Triumph of the Dark,” which is an European international history of the 30 — of the °33 - °39 period. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I have a very high opinion of her, and of her work, which follows a book she did on the 1920s. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Big book, very big book. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But I think that there may well be issues in there that are still worth looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But other than her, and as I said, the book just came out last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">People just don’t seem much interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They’re interested in the war itself, and they continue, as I s — told y — mentioned, to turn out books on the origins of the first World War, another one comes out every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But I do not feel, frankly, that I have a copyright on either the 1930s or the war, and that if someone else would like to do this, they are welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">The one caution that I would put in there is that the amount of records that is available, is very big, and you better be prepared to spend a lot of time.</span><span class="sentence" id="700">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">The — the <span class="BUILDING">German foreign office</span> itself, as an institution, has recently attracted renewed attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">There was a — a German historical commission looking in to the history of the <span class="BUILDING">German foreign office</span> during the 1930s, and during the war and the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And the book was published in 2010, called “The German das amt(ph).” </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Made a bit of splash in the German press. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">What do you think of that study?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  Well, I wa — I have the book and I’ve read it, but it’s a very interesting and I know at least a few of the people who’ve been involved in preparing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I think it’s quite thoughtful, but it does not, in my judgment dig sufficiently carefully into some of the people involved, and their actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Let me — the best way to put this clear is an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">One of the central figures in the German foreign ministry in the 30s and 40s, was Ribbentrop’s Secretary of State, Ernst von Weizsacker, who was tried after the war, sent to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">At one time during the war, when the Germans were rounding up Jews to be killed, they also tried to get them from the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And when they started after the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , the Finnish — excuse me, the Swedish government, informally sounded in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , whether it would satisfy the Germans if they took these Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">That sounding was made to Weizsacker, and he waved it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">The document was published, in fact, by the Germans, in the series a — the German edited series of the wartime foreign office March 13, 2012 documents from December ’41 to May of ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">This, of course, is why the next year, when the Germans went after the Danish Jews, the Swedish government, instead of quietly asking, is it okay if we take them, announced on the radio, we will take them, and the Danes put the Jews on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and sent them to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Now, that complex is completely missing from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Weizsacker’s role, in the negative sense, which ironically would have a positive impact for the Danish Jews, but negative for many from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And yet, it seems to me that that’s an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the people who put together Das Amt(ph) certainly did not dig carefully enough into, in this instance, the published record. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We’re not talking about some great secret here. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">The document — the relevant key document was published many years ago, and 1s in <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> , and not just in mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And I think that there are other areas where a more careful look — now what, of course, I don’t know, is what, if anything, was edited out by the official authors of the book, who had people working for them, who may very well — I have no way — no inside knowledge here — turn up things that for one reason or another they didn’t include, or get around to. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">But it is, at least, I would argue, a respectable start into a set of issues about continuity and change, that is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  If you turn to your — your own work, your opus [indecipherable] the book that most contemporaries now associate you with, is the one [indecipherable] history of March 13, 2012 World War II, “A World At Arms,” which appeared in 1994. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">What moved you to take on such a vast project?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  In 1978, I sent off to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> press, the text of the second volume of the study of Hitler’s foreign policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And I had to decide what to do next. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And I will tell you why, of the various possibilities, which I won’t go into, I decided to do a World War II history. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I’m talking about ’78. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I was very dissatisfied with the existing literature on the war, for the following reasons, most of which, I’m afraid, still hold. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">One was that most of those who’ve written on the war, make the same mistake the Germans and Japanese made during the war, it never occurred to them that the earth is round. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You would get long discussions of the war in Europe, quite separate from long discussions of the war in the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">But the leaders had to make decisions about both, as they were both going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">The most recent edition of one of the major, well-known books on the war, I won’t mention the authors here, in fact comes out in two volumes. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">The European war, the Pacific war. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">But they did not take place on different <span class="NPIP">planets</span> , in different centuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They took place on the same cent — in the same century, on the same <span class="NPIP">planet</span> , and choices, allocation of resources, decisions about where to launch offensives or defensive [indecipherable] process, all had to be made by the folks at the top, about both simultaneously. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">From — a second aspect of the literature that I was very disturbedMarch 13, 2012 about was — especially in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , was a reliance on German military memoirs, especially those translated into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And since this 1s, to a very considerable extent, a collection of garbage, the — people had been, and allowed themselves to be misled. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I see recently — I won’t mention the author, a big book on World War II, where the person still believes the fairy tale that Field Marshall Manstein put into his personal memoirs, that he had ordered [indecipherable] isolated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> to break out. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The reality is he made — gave no such order, but fabricated it in his memoirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">The oten — third factor that I found very troubling, was the absence of purpose from most of the literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">The Germans did not start the war because the French would not allow Hitler to see the <span class="BUILDING">Eiffel Tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">There was a purpose to the war, and it was not that they had an army they didn’t know what to do with one weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">The war was to start a demographic revolution on the globe, of which killing all Jews was to be a central part. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Now I’ve always argued it is not a coincidence that when Hitler ordered in writing, the killing of the handicapped, in late October °39, he dated it for September ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And nobody can persuade me that that’s because they didn’t have a calendar. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">He also, in his speeches, published by the Nazi regime, in — during the war, would repeatedly refer to his promise to kill all Jews in Europe, on 30 — January ’39, always said he did it on — for September ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Now these two quite deliberate mis-datings, are, in my March 13, 2012 personal opinion, an interesting way of providing insight into the way Hitler and his associates were thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">That is to say, the demographic revolution was what the globe — what the war was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">It was not that he always wanted to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="750">When a killing squad is assigned to Rommel in the summer of ’42, it was not because Rommel was sent into <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> so that they could dismantle the <span class="DLF">pyramids</span> , and re-erect them outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It was so that they — he could supervise the killing of all Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , before the <span class="REGION">area</span> was turned over to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , as Hitler planned to do, and he didn’t trust the Italians to do a thorough job. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And he had very good reasons for — for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">The war wasn’t started, as I said, without some purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And much of the literature on the war, completely disregards what was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And I’ve always thought it was very interesting, that in the winter of °41 - °42, in the German records, the diary of Fremborg(ph), the correspondence of Stief(ph), they comment on the fact, there are no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to send winter uniforms to our soldiers who are freezing to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">While on the same <span class="DLF">tracks</span> there are plenty of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to take Jews from <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> to eastern — to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The priorities of the regime, from time to time, were very clear, but that was missing from the literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">A fourth part of the literature that alarmed me back in ’78, was that there had been, in the earlier 70s, and mid-70s, very large scale declassification of documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And most people writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , found it most expedient not toMarch 13, 2012 look at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And I knew from my work on foreign policy, that that’s a very time consuming business, and you have to get some grant money to spend time in <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> , but wasn’t it about time that these things were utilized? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So I decided — and by this time, you understand, I’m ho — I’m holding an endowed chair professorship at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">With it comes a research and travel allocation that — that’s what I’m gonna do. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Although it takes a whil — it’s gonna take quite a while, but since nobody else has done it, which is part of why I did my book on the origins of World War II, I figured I’d give it a try.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  And it took you 16 years? </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Did I calculate it correctly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Not quite, it took 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  Because it took two years for them to get out the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  But the — but the text went off to the publisher in ’92.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Was it easy to find a publisher for such an ambitious project?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  Well, the first publisher, after they saw being part of it, decided that they could not publish a thousand page book on World War II, and so I said okay, though they subsequently published a thousand page book on the British navy in World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And I kid them periodically as to the number of copies of that that they may haveMarch 13, 2012 sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">The next publisher was a university publisher in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , who got confused as to what to do, and so on, so forth, so I shifted. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">The Cambridge University Press editor came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And they decided they would do it, and a — since they had just published a book on an important figure, for which they were charging either 80 or 90 dollars, I insisted I would not sign with them, unless they would promise to keep the cost of the hard bound book under 40 dollars, which they proceeded to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And it was kind of interesting that when they sent — I suggested that they keep the margins smaller, and that would keep down the number of pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And they assured to — I was informed, politely, that they had been publishing books in a certain way for several hundred years, and they were not going to change, even if it would save a hundred pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So, it came out, and — in 94, and they had a marvelous copy editor, whom I got to know, who was in the Wrens, the women’s navy, British navy in World War II, and who was very good, and did a fabulous job of copy editing. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And they printed it, and at least to begin with, the hardbound was, I think, 35.95, or 36.95, and the softbound was well under 20 dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  So beyond the competitive pricing of the book, how do you explain the success of this book? </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Which nerve did you hit with it? </span><span class="sentence" id="784">March 13, 2012
ANSWER:  Well, I think that there are a number of people who have told me they like the comprehensive coverage. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">They like the fact that if they want to, they can dip into it, read a chapter on the <span class="REGION">home front</span> , read a chapter on weapons systems. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Read something about the Pacific war, if they’re interested, read something about the war in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They — the style appears to appeal to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Scholars like it because in the back notes, I refer to the archives, and to issues that still need to be investigated. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And although I repeatedly am told that the — when faculty assign it as a text in World War II courses, at first the students are aghast, because they see the size of the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">They then like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">It reads well, they tell me, and in one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where it was dropped for another, the students rebelled and said, we want that one back. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">The price has — has unquestionably helped, and of course, by the time tens, and by now hundred thousands are in print, that means that the students who use their computers, or their <span class="BUILDING">bookstores</span> , can find used copies at very reasonable prices, at a time when other textbooks, including ones in this <span class="DLF">field</span> , are getting more and more and more expensive, a-and this one 1s accessible financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And of course, I always remind people who talk about the size, I tell them it was a big war, and that’s not my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And that they are — that is is a multiuse book. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">That in the summer they can use it as a doorstop, and that in the winter they can keep it in the trunk of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and then they will not skid on ice, and if they run into a snowdrift, March 13, 2012 they have something to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So there are all kinds of advantages, in addition to the actual contents o-of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And th-there’s been translated into German, Spanish, Polish, I thi — I’m not — Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And it’s supposed to be translated into one or two other languages, but I have no idea whether it will or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The only one that I checked against the original was the German edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  Okay. [</span><span class="sentence" id="801">break] Which are the major scholarly debates you found yourself involved in, over the course of your career?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  Well, the first one came when I was asked by the quarterly for contemporary history in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , in view of my prior writings and work, to write a article on the German decision to invade the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And since I had worked on this a good deal, I wrote an article for them in German, had the German corrected by my father, and sent it off, and they published it. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">We’re talking about around 54 or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And then, two German scholars responded with an article arguing quite differently, and I was given the opportunity to respond to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Ironically, the key figure who wrote disputing what I had written was Andreas Hillgruber, a German scholar who ironically then eventually came around to my view, and in his bi — big book on the subject of Hitler’s strategy, took my position rather than the one, that along with Seraphim, who had been his dissertation director, had taken in their response to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Thereafter, I was not really so much in direct disputes, as taking positions March 13, 2012 that others very often did not agree with. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And that continues to be the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And that is true, particularly I would argue, 1-in relation to Holocaust studies, where the tendency in the last 30 years or so, has been to do Hamlet without the Prince of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Everybody wants to look and does look at this district commissioner, that military figure, that local governor, that Gauleiter, or whatnot, but nobody wants to look at Hitler any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And that’s one <span class="REGION">area</span> there, where I rather disagree. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">That is to say, 1n a society, not just in a dictatorial society, but also in a democratic society, the tone is set at the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And then people try to accommodate themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">They have lots of discretion and accommodate themselves in different ways, and do it differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But unless one looks at where and what the impetus is, people miss what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And I think it is interesting, to take just the one rather dramatic example, but there has just appeared a big book on the Holocaust in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> by Jean Ancel. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And he makes it very clear that there’s lots of persecution of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and by Romanians; the Iron Guard, the government and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And there are some pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">But it’s when the dictator of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , Antonescu meets with Hitler personally on the 12" of June, 1941, and Hitler tells him that after — that when the newly <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span> fall under German and Romanian control, all the Jews there are to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And it is then that the Romanians change. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And having killed and persecuted lots of Jews before, and having killed maybe a coupleMarch 13, 2012 thousand, in the following two years they kill over 400,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I would suggest that there is a difference when a degree becomes a differ — difference in kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">That aspect, you see, I —I see differently from most. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">The other aspect which I see differently from most is that people keep yakking about killing the Jews in Europe, and being unwilling to face up to Hitler’s view that all on earth needed to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">When the Germans killed the Jews in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dodecanese islands</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aegean</span> , they are living in what by German definition is a part of <span class="REGION">Asia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">When they attach a killing squad to Rommel’s <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="REGION">north Africa</span> , at least on my atlas, neither <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> nor <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> is a part of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And what people simply don’t want to face up to is that Hitler personally at great length explained to the grand ra — mufti of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , that Jews on the whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> have to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">But people find that too frightening, I guess, to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And s-so therefore, they keep talking about Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, and ignore the fact that it was the military operations of the Soviet Union, Great Britain and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that essentially confined a worldwide scheme, to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So there are some issues there, which I continue to see differently from most. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">The other — another <span class="REGION">area</span> , I guess where — although it’s only been explicit once, I see it differently from many, not all, is on the German military leadership of the second World War, which I would suggest that the top and strategy was generally incompetent, when othersMarch 13, 2012 think was competent. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And that it has become a kind of cliché, that they always disagreed with Hitler, and they were right and he was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And usually they agreed with him, and very often when they disagreed, he was as often right as they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">In the Pacific war, I have, for many years been intrigued by the total neglect and the discussion of the Japanese plans of which we knew, to kill all allied prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And of the Japanese agreement at the top, that when the allies invaded the home islands, Japanese casualties would be 20 million. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">It may well be, I have often thought, that the Japanese award in the 60s, of the highest decoration to a foreigner, to General LeMay, who commanded the assault on — air assault on the <span class="REGION">home islands</span> , including the great fire raid on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , and the atomic bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Perhaps they realized that 150,000 is considerably smaller number than 20 million, but many of my colleagues in American history cannot get that arithmetic as straight as evidently the Japanese have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  You have taught at four <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> ; <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">You had a long, fruitful career as a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">When, and under what circumstances did you begin to teach the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  There are two quite separate answers to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I have taught the Holocaust as a part of modern Europe, modern German, and World War II history as long as I’ve taught, starting, ironically, back in 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">The first time I have taught a course March 13, 2012 entitled Holocaust was here at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span> , and that would have been, I would say a little — 20, or a little over 20 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">The — the history department at this <span class="BUILDING">university</span> has a program of undergraduate seminars called, History 90s, because that’s their number in the catalog. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">These are limited to 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I introduced a History 90 on the Holocaust, which was the first Holocaust taught — ever taught here, around 20 years ago, or a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And it always filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But, at the same time, I had lots of other teaching responsibilities, and the survey courses; Western Civ, the World since 1945, a big course I introduced. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">German history, European 20" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So I would teach this, if you will, one Holocaust seminar for undergraduates, over and o —a number of times over the years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  And what were the reactions to this new course? </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I mean, what — how did the students react to it, how did other faculty react to it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">ANSWER:  Well, other faculty reacted to it in a normal way that a committee has to approve courses, and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">With more or less enthusiasm, I frankly don’t know, because that is essentially a routine operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">The students filled it up every time, and then when it got to 15, it was closed, because that was the way that type of course is set up in the department. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And while once or twice, under very special conditions, with appropriate paperwork, we got a 16" student in. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But these were never big lecture classes of any sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  And do you think that Holocaust education is now well established in <span class="BUILDING">American high schools</span> and <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> , or do you think that interest might wane at some point? </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Or, put differently, what challenges do you see for Holocaust education in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  Well, i-it seems to me, I don’t really know enough about secondary education, and I know that it is taught in many insto — <span class="BUILDING">institu</span> — <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And that in many states there are requirements in this <span class="DLF">field</span> , and in many states efforts are made to prepare teachers, that is public school teachers, properly, so they can do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I do know a little bit ki — more about the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and university system, and there it is reasonably well established, I would argue, for a couple of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">One of them is that there are many scholars who have worked in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , who accept positions in modern European or modern German history, and who are interested in offering a course on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And the other side of this, very closely related to this, is that departments who need large numbers of enrollments, to offset courses they need to offer, in things like medieval history, where they’re not going to get large numbers of students, but need to offer them, are interested in the fact that Holocaust courses are always filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And I know, both from my own PhDs around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and others, that when there is a course offered, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> are filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And if you ask, well, why are the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> filled, it is not because these March 13, 2012 courses are required. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">It is — they are filled because there is a general public interest, and students are interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Whether it satisfies a particular degree requirement or not, or can be used as one of a vast number of courses that would fulfill a particular requirement, th-the reality is that the students go to the courses on the Holocaust because they have an interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">They’ve heard about this, they want to know something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And if it’s offered, that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And the other side of this is that department chairs know that if one of their faculty members is going to offer a course, it’s going to be full. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And so, because of the interest out there, not because of a requirement that students take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Under those circumstances, I would argue that the <span class="DLF">field</span> 1s reasonably well established. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">That doesn’t mean that there are no issues or problems, and I would suggest that the future here depends heavily on faculty members being honest and forthright about a differentiation between the Holocaust and other genocides. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">That doesn’t mean that one is a hierarchy of better or worse, but what I would argue is a sense of differentia — differentiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And it is in this regard that the issue I just alluded to, that is to say where I differ with many in this, the concept of a worldwide killing program. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">All other genocides of which we know, are geographically defined. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The Turks wanted to kill Armenians in <span class="COUNTRY">Armenia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">They had not the slightest interest in Armenians who had emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">The UstaSe in World War II <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> wanted to March 13, 2012 kill Serbs who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">The fact that there are lots of Serbs living — or people of Serb descent living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , they assumed they wouldn’t like when they hear about this, but there was no particular interest in going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> to kill people of Serb background. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">One of the major differentiations I would argue, between the Holocaust and all other known forms of genocide, was the concept of a worldwide program. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And I think that in the future, as the time in which the Holocaust occurred, recedes further and further into the past, and other genocides, like the one in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , are chronologically seen 50 or a hundred years from now, as being about the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I think that unless those who do work on the Holocaust, both in their research and in their teaching, are ho-honest about differentiations, not that one is worse than another; people are dead whether they are killed in one or the other, but that the conceptualization of this was different, and novel in its own way, as well as the implementation on an industrial scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I think that is an issue that the teaching of the Holocaust, at the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and university level in the future, has to — what to engage, the reality as a future generation of students looks back on a variety of mass killings, none of which was better or worse than the other mass killings, but out of which group, the Holocaust stands apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Not above, not below, but apart, in a category by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">March 13, 2012
QUESTION:  Dr. Weinberg, as you look back on your successful and eventful life, what do you remember as the most exciting moments of your scholarly career? </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Like a discovery, recognition and insight, which moment do you remember as particularly exciting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  Well, I’m not sure that I remember one more than another. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I was very excited when I got my first opportunity to teach at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> , because I had not had that opportunity before, at a <span class="BUILDING">college university</span> level. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I was quite excited when I, in the summer of ’58, I looked at what turned out to be not a draft of “Mein Kampf,” but this other book of Hitler’s which, since I was working on German foreign policy, here was Adolf himself writing on foreign policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I thought that that was a very good coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I guess the other moment was when my wife Janet took a picture of me at the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , when I was sending to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , in a huge crate, two copies of the World War II book manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">QUESTION:  And what did you find most rewarding, most gratifying in being a scholar and a teacher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  The response of students. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I like my students, even the ones that didn’t do so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But I like getting a sense of looking at students while I was speaking, when their faces sort of lit up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Oh, I get that. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And I was very pleased to have a succession of graduate students who moved forward in their graduate work, and March 13, 2012 none of whom is unemployed today. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And a— a majority of whom went into academic careers, but a substantial number into other careers in the government, and in archives. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And that is always very interesting, because of course, they learn more about the subject they’re working on than I ever had learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And it was very interesting to have this combination of individuals, and their — their relationship with me, both then and after they had finished, a-and to see other people make new discoveries, this — find new connections, and then go forth into the world — the academic or the government world, and make successful careers for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  Is there anything you wish to add to this interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  Well, perhaps I should mention the two monuments that aren’t up, that I think should be up. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">One monument should be up in ger — or at least plaque should be up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the other in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Eng — 1955, the Austrian state treaty provided for an independent <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and the allied occupation troops to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">When the American occupation troops left their <span class="REGION">zone</span> [indecipherable] <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And in one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that they had ta — the Americans had taken over from the Germans, they found a bunch of records. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And those records, it turned out, were the records of the <span class="REGION">area</span> , <span class="REGION">military area</span> district horse draft board. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">We forget today that in Europe, until World War, and into World War II, governments drafted not just people, but also horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">The question then arose, what’s to be done with these March 13, 2012 records? </span><span class="sentence" id="912">The Austrians said, well, these were Austrian horses, and the records were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and the records should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and if the Germans want to look at them, they’re welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And the Germans said, oh, but these are German records, they were created by our agency, the horses are all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">The records should go to the <span class="BUILDING">military archive</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> , and if the Austrians want to use them, they’re welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">When there are legal questions in the American military, they go to the Judge Advocate General’s office in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And the lawyers there decided uh-uh, these are American records, they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Which is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">But because they were American records, they naturally fall under American archive law. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And that meant, among other th — two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Number one, that American privacy rules would apply to them, and we applied them in our microfilming. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But it also means that there would be the system of records disposal. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">The the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> would present to a joint committee of <span class="BUILDING">House</span> and Senate, disposal schedules from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">These records go to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> , these records go to the <span class="BUILDING">regional archive</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> , or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">These records get destroyed, nobody needs them. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">These records are sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the federal republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And if the congressional joint committee agreed, as I’m informed it generally did, that’s how they got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I have therefore been long of the opinion, both orally and in print, that the Germans should put up at least a plaque inMarch 13, 2012 honor of the Austrian horses who got them their records back. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Seems to me only reasonable. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">The Brits need to put up a plaque, or a monument of some sort, to the Duchess of Windsor, because if she had not, as Wallace Simpson, put her sites on the man, the Prince of Wales who became Edward the eighth, and who abdicated in order to marry her, the British would have been stuck with him, whether he married someone else, or remained unmarried, for the rest of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And sparing the British from having him as king during World War II, is something that P’ve long argued that people in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> ought to acknowledge by some kind of plaque, or other dedicated thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">In my own work in the British records, it is very clear that in 1940, thi — by this time, the Duke of Windsor, because of course, he had abdicated before, and George the sixth was king, and his wife, the Duchess of Windsor were, if not very strongly pro-German, inclined in that direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They had no sense of what really was going on in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And at a time when <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was being assaulted from the <span class="DLF">air</span> , their main concern was the fate of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">Paris apartment</span> , and whether one of his junior aids could get an exemption from the British draft. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They shipped him off to the <span class="COUNTRY">Bahamas</span> , but this was not the kind of person that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> needed in its great hour of need, and people tend to forget that George the sixth, who became king and was king through the whole war, into the beginning of the 50s, when he died, was a man who had then, on a British March 13, 2012 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">warship</span> , in 1916, at the Battle of Jutland, the great naval engagement of that war. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">This was somebody who had a connection to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , it was thought that Edward the eighth never did have. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And so, since she was the one who took the initiative to arrange — or have it arranged, let me put it that way, that George the sixth became king, I think the Brits owe him one — owe her one.</span></p>
