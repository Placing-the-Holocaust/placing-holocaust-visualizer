him. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">He said, "I cannot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="474">My mother was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">You see. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">He said, "I couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">40 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I.... cannot go.” </span><span class="sentence"

id="494">But the time went and the exit visa was gone and we get another call and they said, "If you don't leave now, you will never leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="495">That's the Underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So my husband again went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">American Consul</span> was, and he said to him, "It's desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I will be killed and we all will be killed if you don't give us the..."I can't do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But...then

class="sentence" id="510">So he had told me that while he was talking to the <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> he remembered his other Spanish visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">He went to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> and there was one girl left. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And she said, "I can't do anything.” </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="519">Then, of course, I...I had to sign different things and at 3 O'clock on that Saturday afternoon, here comes out a very looking man. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I forgot his name, thank God. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">He gave me my passport, gave me his hand and said, "Here is your passport.” </span><span class="sentence" id="522">For you, I miss my

</span><span class="sentence" id="526">He said, "For you, I missed my golf.” </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and I had to tell my mother that we will leave and we didn't...and my sisters after me died when my husband was <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and then I.... It was terrible, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You couldn't tell people, but I had to tell my mother and my brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  You had to leave without your mother?</span></p>
