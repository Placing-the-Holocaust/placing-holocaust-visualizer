<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  I don’t remember the exact day that we had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I think there was training flights that we went just to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , turn around, come back, three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And April 26, 2013 then on the day of the — the bomb, when I fir — when I was shot down, why we got up quite early in the morning, about four o’clock or something like that, I don’t remember the exact time. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was early. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Had the briefing and then we took off and we used to climb at certain altitudes [indecipherable] because you have a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So they have a colored flares, and you have a — each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> has a different colored flare and they fire it off up there at altitude and then you rendezvous onto that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">That’s your definition, and you start from there on your mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So, you climb to a pretty good altitude before you start to cross the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And it was interesting to, before that, that the V-1s that they were firing on <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they were these kind of a putt, you hear them flapping, cause they had a —a pulse jet motor on them, and you’d hear those at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And as long as they weren’t coming right over your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Because they didn’t steer them, they just had an angle, wherever they go, and then they would kick the rudder over and — the horizontal stabilizers rather, and they just dive straight down. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The British developed a technique to keep those from coming into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They had a fighter — real big fighters called nape — Typhoon, with a Napier Sabre big engine on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Wasn’t — I guess it was too heavy to be a real good fighter like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Spitfire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And they would send those out over the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> when they hear — see these things coming in, cause they flew at a certain altitude, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Typhoons</span> would fly along April 26, 2013 the side of them and flap the wing on them and tip the gyro in, and they just spiral into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So the British really did a good job on downing many, many hundreds of those darn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-I1s</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  It had to take some pretty skilled flying to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Yeah, well they just fly alongside. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They were doing about maybe, I don’t know, 300 miles an hour, 250 mile an hour, fly alongside and just flap the wing, you know, tip it a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The — the — tip the gyro in the rocket and they just spiral into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It was a clever idea, you know, and didn’t take — they didn’t fire on them because if they shot them, and then they explode and you'd fly right through all that debris.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  So it was a clever idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Didn’t take much you know, and the <span class="DLF">air</span> — Typhoons could catch them real easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So I thought that was real clever, myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  When was the first time you, after your training, and after you did the coastal runs and what have you, that you crossed over the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> and went on a combat mission?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Th-The — what day, you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  No, not necessarily day, but what was that experience like? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Do you remember tha — going over for the first time? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">April 26, 2013
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I remember going over and seeing the — the <span class="DLF">coastline</span> and — and seeing some other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> where ya — I think we took — some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> took wa — one hit — I remember over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I think it was, one took a — took a direct hit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bomb bay</span> , it looked like, cause it just blew up, disappeared, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And then we went on to our target, 1t was a dru — it was an underground airbase, <span class="BUILDING">fighter base</span> , and they had <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> and stuff in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> where they’d put the fires <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and everything was camouflaged, so it was a hard thing to find, but they were trying to knock out as much of those fighters as they could because of the invasion forces, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So we made a — went out and found the initial point, which is an identifiable point that you — they can find to turn on, and they drove cer — certain altitudes, certain speed and in a certain direction, and to the target. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We met the first time and that — the bombardier couldn’t find the target, camouflaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So you do a no-no, we — we made a 360 degree turn and went back to same initial point and started the same course, same altitude, same everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">By that time the barrage flak that you see all the time hadn't got us the first time, so they had their tracking flak on us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They knew our altitude, our course, they knew where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So the tail gunner says, about 300 yards off the tail, had a burst. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Next one through the waist, and the left wing wen-went off, and we caught on fire and started into a spiral. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I always figured I’d ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> down, get out of the crash or April 26, 2013 something. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But you change your mind rather quickly when that happens, so I — guys just bailing out, you know, when they gave the order to bail out. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I started out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">radio room</span> and heard the ball turret gunner was spinning around, so I figure the communications were shot out or something, so I grabbed a big tuner, you know, the transmitter in the radio room and started beating on top of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he pointed the guns down and the handles come up and I flipped it out and he pops out. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">He was a little guy, and he popped out of there so quick I couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Hand him his parachute, he sta — snapped it on and boy he was out the win — out the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I was right behind him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  What altitude were you at when you bailed, roughly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  What — what else did I take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  What al-altitude were you at when you bailed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Was about — I think about 27,000 - 27 five —
QUESTION:  So you were up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  You were up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  We were about — about 30,000 we started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  But we were in a dive, sort of a spiral dive, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">April 26, 2013
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  What was that experience like, bailing out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  I didn’t have too much, I guess the excitement, and all that stuff, that you don’t think about it, I was just trying to get out of that fiery <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And so we’d always been told to delay your jump, cause they may — may shoot you coming down in the parachute, you know, a fighter come by, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So I had delayed my parachute til I could kind of see the leaves on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And I popped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chute</span> and it seemed like I took a couple swings and I was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And then there was a—a little boy, a lady, and a — at the end of this <span class="DLF">field</span> where I landed in, there was a little boy over there and a lady, and so I — he ran over towards me and I reached in my kneepads to get my escape kit out and there’s a little — we have books in there, a little book that says English and French, you know, cause we [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and maps and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And he pointed the [indecipherable] in the book, and he says hide, in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So they took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So I stuck my parachute under some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> there at the edge of the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and ran through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and got to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I didn’t know going to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is that I was getting deeper in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , but I come to a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Now that little boy don’t want to go out in there, cause gonna see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So I just heard these — all these Germans running, April 26, 2013 you could hear them, and there’s — their canister they carry with them is — their gas mask rattles like a tin can, you know, so I heard rattling, so I just dove under some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> right there and pulled them down kind of over me and laid there, waited, and hear when the Germans come up, he’s — I could reach out and grab his pant leg, he was so close, but he was looking way out ahead, he wasn’t looking down at his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And I don’t know, it seemed like I laid there for a day, 1t was probably an hour or something like that, and he kept looking out there, and I didn’t breathe for a couple hours, I don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But anyhow, they finally went away and then I just walked through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and — and I got my maps and there — they had maps that they gave you were like a silk handkerchief, but their maps were detailed, they had the curves in the <span class="DLF">road</span> , you could see <span class="DLF">paths</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and they had — I don’t know where I got them, but they were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So I saw a curve in the <span class="DLF">road</span> and it’s where I was at, and I located myself and then I started out to cross this one <span class="DLF">road</span> , a divided <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then I heard a big racket coming, I was right in the middle of it, it was quite wide, their divided <span class="DLF">highway</span> was, and there’s <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and s — lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> growing in the middle of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And around the corner I get — hear them coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So I dove into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and hear a bunch of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> and everything else was coming by, and guys in, I don’t know, looked like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored cars</span> or something, I didn’t — I wasn’t able to really look, I was — buried myself in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , hoping they April 26, 2013 didn’t see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And they went on by, didn’t see me, so I thought[indecipherable] get out of here, so I headed back. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And every time I seen one walking, I would just veer off at an angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I wouldn’t walk close to them, cause they’d see me, identify me. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So I just kept quite a ways away, and veer off at an angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I never made any sharp turns or quick turns or anything like that, and finally I came to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest area</span> , and I ran across an old deserted — I don’t know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but it was pretty dilapidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So I went in there cause it had been raining, and I got all wet and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So I took off my coveralls, cause I had coveralls with suspenders and stuff, my flight suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So hung up on the thing in the top of it there, and laid down on the straw, and went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And then the next morning, early the next morning, I don’t know, seven — six, seven o’clock, or what time it was, but I heard crack — like sticks breaking, and stuff like that, and I peek out. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Here is a guy out there, I thought he was an old man, it looks pre — he was probably 40 years old, cause I was only 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And so I didn’t know what to do, I had my .45 automatic, pil — you know, shoulder holster and sa — I says, I don’t know whether to shoot at the guy, or make a noise in the — I had to make a decision real quick here. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So I thought no, I stuck the gun in the straw, and I stepped out to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , pulled the — and peeked out to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And he put his finger up to his mouth like be quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And he says [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I didn’t know French, but I thought that meant friend or April 26, 2013 something. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So he says, shh. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And so about 10 - 15 minutes later, here he come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Started motioning me to come with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So I reluctantly went with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  Did you take your weapon with you or leave it in the straw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  No, I left it in the straw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I didn’t want to be caught with it because I’d always been told, if you wi — get with the French underground — and I| didn’t know who itt was, they didn’t know me either, why, if you don’t do exactly what they say, they’Il shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You know, because they don’t know who you are either. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Maybe an infiltrator. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So I figure it’s best just to not take the chance, I’Il just leave the gun there. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So I left it in the straw and went with him, and we walked through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> quite a ways, maybe a mile it seemed like. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And came to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went to the back hou — of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> — brick, like <span class="DLF">brick fence</span> , but half of it was torn down so that when we stepped over that, went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And the family — I took my concentrated [indecipherable] my escape kit, and gave it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And they made me hot chocolate and brought it to me and breakfast in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I stayed there about three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">One time the German came to look — I — I guess just watch — looking for people, and they hid me out in the pigpen out 1n the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And then they brought me back in, I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And then they brought a — a couple of — a guy who had a April 26, 2013 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for me, and he took me out — he ga — he gave me fresh clothes to put on. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had a tam, and stuff like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  How long were you with that family before you got —
ANSWER:  Three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Three days, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  And —
QUESTION:  Did you know their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I wish I did, but I don’t remember their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They had a — a young lady there, their daughter I guess it was, that used to bring the warm cereal and kind of coffee and — kind of an ersatz type coffee, I don’t know, it was of str — strange ta —
QUESTION:  Chicory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Yeah, like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And that was — I was treated real well there and they — like I had a nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And then, you know, I rode away with this guy, he took me to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and that was Madam Marie Duvall(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And there I met a — well, a pilot, Jim Fore(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">April 26, 2013
ANSWER:  Yeah, he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And so, I was really surprised to see him, you know, but I guess they were all in the underground group there, you know, and we all lit in a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Anyway, here I met him, and —
QUESTION:  I don’t suppose you had occasion at that point to question his circling around and doing that bomb run again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">No, you — you know, they said they were — and th — and said, we gotta take out these — these <span class="BUILDING">fighter bases</span> and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Cause they told us in briefing, you know, gotta get it done. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So, you — you do what you’re assigned to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So if you made the decision, make a 360, why, he knew more about it and what — what was going on than I did, he and the bombardier, so you know, I —
QUESTION:  Did he recognize you straight away when he saw you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  Oh, oh yeah, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We gave each other a hug, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And we stayed there a few days and the lady, Madame Marie Duvall(ph) had a — there’s a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and they had a radio in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and we could listen to BBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So we got there, we — I stayed there, I don’t know, three or four days maybe, I don’t know wa — I—I don’t remember exactly how many, but then a guy in a two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , a horse drawn two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> came by, and we got in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with him, and we rode through a ho — little — down a <span class="DLF">road</span> and then turn a corner, went to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and there was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> there, and soldiers, everything else, and here we were sitting there in April 26, 2013 German — in French tams and stuff, in civilian clothes, and shaking like a leaf here, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But we were just trying to act nonchalant, you know, riding with this guy, cause if they’d [indecipherable] he’d have been shot right away too, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  I didn’t know at first, I didn’t even know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and I thought we were going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">This was my assumption, you know, cause we’d always told they’d take you to <span class="BUILDING">Dulag Luft</span> or something, and interrogate you and then take you to prisoner of war camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But we were kind of shocked when we arrived there, cause April 26, 2013 we saw, you know, that sign out there on the <span class="DLF">gate</span> says, wor-wor-work will make you free, in German, and saw the — all the dogs, and these German guards and there’s skinny prisoners in there, you know, and — and all the striped clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And since we got in there some of the prisoners come up and pretty soon they started telling — and in English, a few of them spoke English, and — or it was relayed through some of the guys that — we had one guy in our group that spoke — Ben Sharf(ph) was a ger — spoke German real well. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And so he said, we’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And then they took us in and stripped all of our clothes off of us and put us in a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> -like thing, you know, and we come out, we didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And then they shaved every hair off of our body and then swabbed us with something like creosote that set us on fire, you know, and you ben — you was dancing around, jumping and si — cause it was burning, Ju-just like it’s peeling the skin off, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And then they brought us down a little fu- further and they started handing us some clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I was given a woman’s silk blouse, and a pair of like silk slacks, or women’s slacks or something, real thin things, no shoes, no socks, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They took everything we had away, our other clothes, before we went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , we thought we were going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> or something, you know, cause we’d heard stories about that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But anyway, we were shocked, sort of, that — and they just finally April 26, 2013 herd us down to an <span class="REGION">area</span> and left us there, we were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on a rock pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I don’t know, we were there I don’t know how many days. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But at night it was getting cold, so we’d all hover around, and cuddle up together, you know, to try to stay wari, and —
QUESTION:  You were out of <span class="DLF">doors</span> during the nights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Yeah, out-<span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and a — kind of a rock pile area there. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And then we — one day we saw — we heard this noise, we look up 1n the <span class="DLF">air</span> and hear a — about 30,000 feet or so up there was a whole bunch of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> coming over, you know, you could see the contrails behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And they were — looked like they were coming right at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We said, holy mackerel, you know, I hope they’re not going to drop those things on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And all of a sudden they popped a flair, like a lead bombardier always pops a flair and they s — the group tightens their formation, and they make a nice pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So we thought, holy mackerel, here they come. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And all of a sudden you heard this ru — it’s — if you ever heard bombs coming down, they fi — sound like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> coming down the <span class="DLF">track</span> , and there’s a little whistle going on to them, and they’re just shredder and rattling like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> coming in, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And all of a sudden — and they started landing below, and we thought, boy, they’re going to get us here. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But not one bomb lit <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the — the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They blew part of the — the <span class="DLF">fence</span> down, but they were bombing the underground <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that — where all the April 26, 2013 wor — the slave labor was used. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And that was a V-2, V-2, gyros and <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> for ammunition and stuff like that there. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So we were relieved and — you know, they didn’t drop it on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But they — apparently they went down the <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> , took out about 2,000 SS guys and — and gutted the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> with — they first went in with explosives and then they dropped incendiaries after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Then they dropped leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I saw one of the leaflets, but they started shooting at people that picked up the leaflets, so there were — but there were still a few prisoners got ahold of leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I saw one of them later. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It showed a picture of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17</span> and a silhouette of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-29</span> , showed how much bigger the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-29</span> was and that we warned the Germans that they were going to start using these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> on them if they don’t surrender, and stuff like that, you know, and — and it showed how Americans treat German prisoners of war, and stuff, 1t showed them in <span class="INT_SPACE">mess halls</span> and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And they — and then had a thing and they were trying to invite the pr — us prisoners to join them and fight against the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And they give us extra benefits or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You know, this kind of crazy thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  Were you made to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  They tried to — they come up and ask us what our profession was, what we could do and stuff like that, and all of said we were students. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We already had agreed to this before, we were going to say they were all students. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And so we — we held by April 26, 2013 that, and they — it made them pretty mad that we didn’t tell them we had any professions other than just students and fliers. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So we — none of us worked, we all refused to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So — I don’t know if that was a good idea or not, but we weren’t — didn’t seem be punished any more for it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And they finally — we were living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , like I say, on the rocks out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And one day — and there were a lot of these little Gypsy kids, you’ve heard about them probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I don’t know how many, there were hundreds of them around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And you had to watch, because if you had any food left at all, you have some, once in a while, about once a week, you get about three little — real small, little baked potatoes, half rotten, but they’d been boiled, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It was better than nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And if one of — if you had piece of those left, they’d steal it, those poor little Gypsy kids that were running around, they were hungry, you know, and they steal anything that wasn’t tied down. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And they were in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there, and one day, it seemed like to me, they all disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And they come down and got us and gave us that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I used to think, oh my, what’d they do, did they kill them all? </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They [indecipherable] their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> what happened to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I still to this day don’t know really what all happened to those poor little kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But they were little — you know, from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> , all the <span class="REGION">eastern countries</span> that they picked them up, their parents were probably killed, and they brought them in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But that was — that’s been kind of a April 26, 2013 disturbing thing all my life, the — what happened to those poor little kids, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But we wer — we got the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and — and we were fortunate to get those, you know, and then we were there I don’t know how long and we got a bowl of grass soup every day, you know, and three — we got about three little potatoes once a week or so, and — and then they brought in some — a barrel one time of la — like little sardines, they were just in saltwater, they were raw things, you know, dead, but — and were in saltwater, real heavy brine saltwater. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And of course we ate those things like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And w-we associated with all the other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">There was a — right near — across from our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Polish barracks</span> , and one day there was a big scuffle over there, you saw a whole bunch of them piling on some guy, and you wonder what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Well, later on I fou — h-heard that this one Polish guy had been at another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and apparently he had been a snitch or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And I don’t know if it was a fake, or what, but they said he knocked a bowl of soup out of one of the guy’s hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So a bunch of them jumped on him and put a blanket over his head and slugged him to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It was just, you know, dog eat dog type attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And then they had these guys, you maybe heard of kapos, they were called kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">These were German prisoners, but they had given them special rations to be — and they were all big guys, and they’d give them a big board or a club, like a baseball bat, and they were to keep us other prisoners 1n <span class="DLF">line</span> , to obey orders you April 26, 2013 know. </span><span class="sentence" id="497"><span class="DLF">Line</span> up, do this, to go here. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So everybody tried to stay away from those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And so — but I used to talk to some of the Polish guys over there spoke English, and you — I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of the esso — SOE guys, they were British and — and some of them were Scottish, most of them British. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">But they were secret type guys, operations guys that were dropped behind the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> to do sabotage and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And they were about — oh, there must have been 30 or so of them in there, 35 or 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And one day they took — took — I heard — I don’t know how many, but th — 17 of them went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , and I guess were tried, they brought them back and killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And later on they killed all the other guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But I used to talk to some of those guys, and I found out two of them were from <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , they were twins, and one had had a scar up in his shoulder, and they put a scar on the other one’s shoulder just like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And they had — one would be up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , up in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> , another would be down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and something would happen, a big explosion or something would happen, they’d catch this guy and — cause he was there, and he had the evidence, because you know, he’d be — be real obvious around someplace, and he said no, I was, you know, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And here that they — they finally coupled the fact together that this — they were twins, and the Germans finally caught them both. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And later on they were both killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They killed all those SOE guys, the British guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And the Russian guys April 26, 2013 —I used to talk to some of the Russians, they’d speak a little bit of English, and one of them used to tell me all the time that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> would never survive because we produced so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and stuff like that, and we would financially and everything, fold after the war, that we couldn’t stand all that production, and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">A few little conversations like that we had with the Russians, you know, that did speak some English. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And they — I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the [indecipherable] but I didn’t know til after the war that they had a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> up there, the Russians, a lot of them disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They would take them up there and there was a like a— a medical examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They’d stand them on some scales, and they had a <span class="DLF">hole</span> right behind the scales, there in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and a gun back there, and they’d turn around like that, and shoot them right through the back of the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And they eliminated a whole bunch of Russians that way by — by make — make them think they were giving them a medical, they were standing on the scale, then bam, they’re gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> there was — I’ve been there a few times after the war, after I been out of there, and they still have the hooks on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> where they used to hang the prisoners, and they would cut them, their legs and bodies, and bleed — let the blood drain out of them into the <span class="DLF">drain</span> , because then they would burn them in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> upstairs, and they had these little trollies that they’d lay them on and wheel them up there, and then wheel them into these <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> up April 26, 2013 there, had about, I don’t know, eight or 10 of these <span class="INT_SPACE">cremation chambers</span> up there, wheel them in there and cremate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Cause they had bodies stacked by the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">The — used to see so much inhumanity to man, that you couldn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">You’re already a prisoner, and you’d be sta — we’d stand up there — we counted — they called it appel. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">My number was 78,336, but — and we weren’t tattooed, and we used to ask the kapos, the fa — the kapos told us that we were not tattooed because we were trading material. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I guess — we — we assumed that that was going to be trading for German prisoners, you know, that we’re — we captured or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We didn’t — and know — don’t really know to this day what it was all about, why we weren’t tattooed. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But there were about — later on I found there were about, probably about 50,000 prisoners there, you know [indecipherable] 78,000, but they were dying off so fast, and I later fi — learned after the war that — from the archives at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> that the diet was designed to starve you to death in about three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Keep cycling prisoners through there, cause they needed ru — labor, slave labor to work in the pri — in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and stuff, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So that was one way of just getting rid of them, starve them to death, rather than shoot them, or some go to — took energy and took people. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I’ve heard all sorts of rumors, I don’t know why, but I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I’ve heard that the — they used to lie in the — you’ve seen where the pictures of the Jewish people lined April 26, 2013 up by ga — by these <span class="DLF">pits</span> and they’d shoot them and drop in the <span class="DLF">pits</span> and they’d cover them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But the people that had to mow them down, those people had mental problems because they didn’t — you know, they were killing other humans. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So that’s why the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> came into being, so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">That was to — cause it wasn’t such a personal thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So — but it’s [indecipherable] because when we stand up for appel to be counted, these SS guys would stand up there, they count your heads, and they had to have the count right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before they would excuse you, go back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , or where you’re gonna go. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Sometimes it’d take three hours, and it — guys — some of the guys were — I weighed 82 pounds when I got out of there, s- some of the guys were skinnier than I was, couldn’t stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And you’d try to help them stand up, and the SS guys would wade in there and knock his brains out with a rifle butt, and make the prisoners put him on a gunny sack, four of them carry him over and stack him by the bodies by the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So it’s just — and there was these two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> running around all day, picking up bodies and hauling them to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So it was just not a very good environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And you just wonder — I used to wonder about how can people be so cruel, and just — you’re already prisoners, you know, why make it even worse? </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But we had a guy whose name the ger — the German SS guy up there was named Hauptman. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And he would stand up there when we were out there, and ge — weather got kind of cool, and he April 26, 2013 had a little bucket, and he had a little cup in it, and he’d say — he’d pull back his uniform, show he had woolen underwear underneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And he’d say, cold, cold? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And then he’d throw — take a s-scoop up a bucket of this water — a scoop of this water and throw it out over us, you know, like spray us, you know, with a little bit of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">He’d say cold? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">He just kind of tormented, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I don’t know what he did it for, but it — how — I don’t know how people get some enjoyment out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Anyway, that was my feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And one day the Americans came over and bombed the — when we were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I was telling you before, living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rocks</span> were — after that bombing, why, we were asked, will you come down and guide us? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They said, if you were soldiers, you have the discipline to help us with the wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And they had a guy in there, I don’t know h — the — he spoke a British accent, like he was — be-been trained in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or something, and he would talk to us, you know, he was the guy that they used for communication to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And then the — they had another guy in there named — he was a Dutchman from du — <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , he spoke good English and he spoke German also. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So they’d communicate through him, and he gave us lots of information. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But anyway, they come down and got us, they says, you will help us with the wounded people in the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Took us up there, and I didn’t help anybody, cause I had no shoes, I was running through this fire and nails and stuff out there, and wood and stuff, and I was April 26, 2013 going as slow as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I saw a wooden — wooden shoe laying over there, and so I kneeled down and put that wooden shoe on my left foot, and the German guards over there picked up some board and started beating me across the back, and you know, knocked the wind out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It seemed like I climbed — I crawled about a mile, probably about 20 feet, but it seemed like a mile, and just got — almost knocked me out, cause I couldn’t hardly breathe, you know, knocked the wind out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And I didn’t help anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I just act like I was help — trying to help some, put out the fire, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I just went around, but I didn’t do a darn thing, but no one bothered me after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Finally, I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">building</span> I was in, but I sure didn’t help anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Some of the guys, I guess, had to help somebody, you know, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">But anyway, when the Luftwaffe guy came through to look — he’s — I guess he was going to say, look at the bomb damage, he told the — the other SS guys that. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And he came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Well, we had a guy, Ben Sharf(ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Prague</span> , <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> , he was our waist gunner. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">He spoke German from his ancestor was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And so we said, Ben, you gotta go up, talk to the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Tell him we should be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So Jim Fore(ph) and I went up with him, close to him, and he s —we told him salute the guy, so he’s — Ben saluted him, and this German off — Luftwaffe officer, he kind of gives a real, slow salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He didn’t know what to do, I think, cause real slow he kind of went like this, real slow, put his hand down. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And April 26, 2013 they talked a few minutes, and then the SS tried to break it up, and he pulled his rank on them and told them to stand back, and so he talked about five minutes to Ben, and he told Ben that they didn’t work very good with the Gestapo and the SS, but he’d do what he could, but we should be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> , he agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And we thought, well, that’s encouraging news, but — and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And it was, I don’t know, a month later, when I hear about a contingent of about 150 Luftwaffe people came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , round us up, took us and put into only about 30 - 40 in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and took us to <span class="BUILDING">Stalag Luft II</span> over — over — over on the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So, man, and we got food, we got shoes, we got clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">It was — it was like being in the <span class="BUILDING">Waldorf Astoria</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But it was really — really grateful th-that he came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Now, I just found out recently that there’s a book called, “A Higher Call.” </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I had heard about a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17</span> that had been shot down, riddled pretty badly, and it was down, oh 3,000 feet or so, and they’d been throwing the radios out and the — the parachutes and everything to lighten <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , they’d get back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Well, this — this German fighter flew right down beside him, wingtip to wingtip, and tried to motion, and — they — they couldn’t communicate, but th-the pilot was Brown, Lieutenant Brown flying that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17</span> , trying to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and this German fighter pilot was trying to make a motion for him to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> — I mean, go to fr — to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , closer, across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And this book is called, “A Higher Call.” </span><span class="sentence" id="577">April 26, 2013 Now, this German fighter pilot was a Catholic guy, and he had even some other fighter pilots with him, had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goering</span> and tried to resign and knock off some of the stuff they was doing, but they almost got shot over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And this book is called, “A Higher Call,” and it’s just recently come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It’s in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I got a copy of it just this — this last month. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It’s quite intriguing to read, but this guy is the same guy that came into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , that got us out of there, and he got us out of there three days before the record — the record showing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> whatever, that we — we were supposed to be eliminated three days — and he got us out three days before we were supposed to all been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The orders had come down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And this was just recently because this guy, Mike Dorsey, his father — his grandfather was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> with us, his name was Easy(ph) Freeman(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And his grandfather started talking about it in recent years, I guess, and so Mike Dorsey was a movie producer, he decided to look into it, and he went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for almost a year research, and then went to all the <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And he made this movie called, “The Lost Airman of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ,” cause we had been lost because they didn’t know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We weren’t in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> until after the war they found where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So, that’s the reason that movie is named that, but I’m glad that he — his grandfather finally started talking about it, and he made this movie, and — and he — he even got — I was surprised, but when he April 26, 2013 went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , looked at all the records, he brought me back my arrest record, my Gestapo arrest picture, and the record of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Shows <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span> , and then has it crossed out, and I think it says [indecipherable] or something up there on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  When you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , how did — did you ind — did you stay with — physically stay with most other allied airman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Oh yes, always.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  And how did you conduct yourselves when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Did you maintain military discipline, did you maintain rank and order?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  Yes, we — we all decided the highest ranking officer would be in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And that happened to be a New Zealander, the only New Zealander there, but he was a — a squadron leader, and so we all agreed our — our highest ranking officer of Americans agreed, we all agreed we would do whatever he said, and we’d act as a military unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And a lot of times even we go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> , that open <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> down there, we’d form up and march like we were soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">The SS guys just — we threw them in fits almost when we do that, because we were acting military, you know, like a unified unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">They didn’t like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So, yeah, we tried to act as military as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">We’d sing songs you know, and stuff like that, and just to — I don’t know, I guess to keep our spirits up. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">May have tormented them too, but I think it was primarily for our own si — you know, our own spirits. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And we all — I don’t know, April 26, 2013 and we also when we were there, we all agreed that if we ever got out of there, we would — we formed a club called the KLB pre-lager <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And we would all meet every year somewhere, and all of us would attend these meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We did for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">We met in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we met in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we met all over the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But all of us guys would get together and it was — it was just a camaraderie that you develop, you know, by being in these situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So —
QUESTION:  When you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , did you actually personally witness any allied servicemen murdered or killed by the —
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I only saw guys get s — knocked around a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">A couple of guys got pneumonia and died, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">That was L.C. Beck(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="610">He was from [indecipherable] Park, <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And Jim Fore(ph) and I, after we got back in service, went to see his parents and tell them, cause they never had any ar — he — he ri — had written some notes when he was with the French underground, and it’s called, I think “Fighter Pilot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And he wrote this little book. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And his parents we — all this information was given to his parents, and they p-printed this little book. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Anyway, we went to see his parents and tell them how his last days were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and he died of pneumonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So, other than that I saw no actual — I didn’t see everything, but I — I just saw no one get ki-killed by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So — April 26, 2013
QUESTION:  Do you have any idea why they sent you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , as opposed to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Yes, I think because we had been caught in civilian clothes, with the French underground, and we — even though they knew who we were, cause they even showed us some pictures of our squad, and showed our — they had the names of our squad and they had a lot of information on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And we had dog tags, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">They knew who we were, but the excuse was, we were caught with — we were saboteurs and terrorists cause were were caught in civilian clothes with the French underground, so we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">That’s the way I assume it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I have no other — no other reason, you know, that I can think of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  You got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and head towards <span class="BUILDING">Stalag Luft IT</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I assume you did not know where you were going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  What happens when you got there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  Kind of shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">We were herded out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Herded in there like I told you, and pretty soon we were herded in there, and took our clothes off, put us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and shaved our heads and bodies and swabbed us and gave us some prison clothes, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We were just in total shock, really, you know, we didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The other prisoners, some of the prisoners, and April 26, 2013 through, like I say, Ben Sharf(ph), and — and Dutch, we found out that the other prisoners say the only way you'll ever leave this <span class="NPIP">place</span> is up the pipe, and that was the crematortum chimney there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So we were constantly told that, you know, the only way out 1s up the pipe. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So we’d all kind of resigned ourselves to that, more or less, you know, and hoping we’d get out and hoping the allies would, you know, get us before the — we got up the pipe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  So it was just — I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I don’t know how we even kept our spirits up, but we — we were doing ra — pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We’d talk a lot and we’d laugh — sit in — this forming of the KLB club was part of — we’d have discussions where we were going to meet, how we were going to do it, how the organization was going to be and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So it was — we — it was all planned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And we had a little badge, we drew up a sig — insignia that we all had, and so it was a — it was just — I think it was to keep us busy, but also the camaraderie, you know, that we’d have if we ever got out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So — and I-I don’t know how, some of the guys who got on the march, like I said, some of the guys that we — when we marched from <span class="BUILDING">Stalag Luft Il</span> , we got there on that march, some of the guys just gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We saw one guy, and he went running, cli — tried to climb the <span class="DLF">electric fence</span> , you know, some guys gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I have a — a strange attitude of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I always believed in a higher April 26, 2013 power like the lord Jesus Christ as a savior, and I, as a kid I went to mi — I’ve got records showing I went to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , never missing a — a Sunday for four years, five years, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And — and when I was put up in front of the firing squad, all I— my cares all went away, I just flat lined, and I, from that day forward, I don’t get excited, I don’t get upset, I don’t get mad, I don’t worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And when I used to work in the engineering stuff, why we’d be on government proposals. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We had three guys in my department die of heart attacks in one year, and they issued stress cards that you hold and they turn color if you start getting stressed, and the director’d hold a meeting, and pretty soon you seen him take his little card out of his pocket, lay it down on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and I knew he was getting stressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And after the meeting, guys used to come up to me, cause they’d be hollering, deadlines and why don’t you do this, why don’t you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And they’d come up to me and say, let’s see your card. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Show them mine, it was normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">They’d say, what the hell is wrong with you, don’t you have any nerves? </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I said yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I says, if this is a problem, fix it. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">If you can’t fix it, what’s the problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  Kind of strange attitude, but I just — I just got that, like I say, after that firing squad, I just can’t bring myself to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I don’t — I’d — hate is a terrible thing too. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I see people hate, and I see what hate does, like the Germans hated the Jewish people, April 26, 2013 and the other people, and I — I just — I— I don’t even hate the Germans, I feel sorry for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Cause even the SS guys, you know, I don’t agree with it, I don’t like it and everything, but I can’t — I just can’t bring myself to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I-I’m a strange duck, I guess, but I — I can’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  How long were you in Stalag Luft IIT?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  Let’s see, I think we were only there maybe three months or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  Did you gain any weight back, were you sick, were you —
ANSWER:  Oh I — yeah, I gained some weight back, I — I don’t know how much I weighed, but I gained some, and I had my — I had a wound in my lower leg when I bailed out, I don’t know if it was from shrapnel, hooked on some [indecipherable] torn metal or what, but I had a pretty good gash just about to the bone, right about halfway up my lower leg, and when I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , why I turned my ankle, I guess it was kind of sore or something, hurt [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> it turned into gangrene, like. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It was all numb and just — couldn’t have any feeling, it felt like just you — you know how your leg — how something goes to sleep when you’re [indecipherable] that’s the way it felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I could hardly feel I was walking on it, you know, it was just kind of bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So when I got to <span class="BUILDING">Stalag Luft III</span> , why, they — they tried to put sulfur drugs and stuff on it and nothing would touch it, so then they put me in the <span class="BUILDING">prison hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And the German doctor there wanted to amputate my April 26, 2013 leg right above the knee. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And I — Captain Daniels, he was — we had Major jone — Davy Jones, and Captain Daniels, who were on the Doolittle raids in Tokyo unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And they ended up in Europe and being shot down, and they were in our — south compound of the da — Stalag Luft III. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Anyway, Captain Daniels there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I said, no, no, no, I— you know, listen, I don’t want my leg cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And so they talked to the German guy, Captain Daniels, and they decided, well, the only solution was to try to save would be to — they made kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tray</span> , a curved tray they laid down on my leg, and they wrapped my leg with gauze about — looked like about two inches thick, and they hung it up at about a 20 - 30 degree angle, and they put a—a-—a metal bucket up there, hung it up there with a nail hole in it, dripping saltwater on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And they dripped it on my toe, and it just run down the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I don’t know if it was a month or something, it dripped — just dripped every day, it was just — it was miserable, just laying there, but you know — anyway it was a long time, I don’t know how long it was, but that thing got — the whole thing got just like a big rock cast, cause all that salt and then it’d evaporate, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And they come in one day and they said, well, we’re gonna cut it off, see what we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So they cut that —all that gauze and stuff off of there, and it was just a —1f you’ve ever seen a parched earth, it’s just cracks and stuff and brown, and rotten looking thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And then they squeezed it with this gauze and stuff, and the pus is squirt out around my April 26, 2013 ankle, and it volcanoes up around my knee and stuff like that, and they’d squeeze it and milk it a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And it stunk like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So he looked at it, and they sh — they kind of shook their heads, and they said, well, it’s doing something, so they wrapped it up again, put the saltwater up there again and kept dripping it on there, and I don’t know, seemed like a month, I don’t know how long it was, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And it got all hard again, they took it off, and it was starting to grow skin back. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So they kept wrap — wrapping in gauze, and stuff like that, and they we — and they finally sent me back to the — my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> back at the saw — compound, and I was there and I was — it was hard to walk on, but it was — I was limping around, and it was getting a little better all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And they would — I — I forget how often the — but they would rewrap it. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I don’t remember, my mind 1s gone, I guess, on how often, but every once in a while they’d — every couple of days, why they’d rewrap the leg, and I'd walk on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">It hurt, but I walked on it, and then I was in — I was — guess I was in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> one night there when all of a sudden they come in and said, we’re — we're gonna leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Cause we’d seen all the low flying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and stuff going, you know, to-towards the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> over there, and we’d heard a lot of rumors about it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And so Colonel Clark, he was a colonel major — he was General Clark at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colorado Springs</span> there, the air — <span class="BUILDING">air academy</span> there later on, but he was a colonel in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there at south compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Major April 26, 2013 Davy Jones and Captain Daniels and Colonel Clark. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Anyway, Colonel Clark asked me, he says, that we’re gonna go on this march [indecipherable] we’re gonna leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">There’s about three foot of snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and Colonel Cl — Colonel Clark asked me, he says, you want to stay here, and be liber — or be — we — get liberated by the Russians? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Or do you want to go with the masses, it’s your choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So I says, Pll go with the masses of people, and maybe the cold and the walking, the circulation will help. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He says, you think you can make it? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I says, well, I’m gonna try. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So I went on the march, I was limping and it hurt, but every day seemed to be a little bit better, cause I think the circulation and the cold — it wasn’t gonna re-infect, I don’t think, with the cold, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I think the circulation was helped by just walking on it, just constantly walking, cause we walked a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And finally got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I was still limping when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but —
QUESTION:  How many days did you march?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  It seemed like a month, but I — I don’t remember how many days we — and I know the first time we marched, what — 60 — I think we marched about 65 miles or something, I had heard, I don’t know how miles it was, but it was — seemed like a couple days. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We stopped at, I think a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Once — I stopped at a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> once with hay, and that were — was pretty nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And two or three times on that trip we stopped at <span class="NPIP">places</span> that we got warm, and they gave us some April 26, 2013 soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I don’t really remember how many days it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I’m sure other people know what — how many days that was on the trip, but —
QUESTION:  Did you understand why you were being marched?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] evacuate from the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , cause the Russians were coming, they were close by apparently, and they wanted to get us away from the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  Well, you don’t want the Russians to get ahold of us, they wanted to just keep us as prisoners, cause we were material that they could trade, or hold hostage, or something like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We just assumed that we were hostages to be held, and the more of us that they could keep, the — the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And getting us away from the fronts, you know, and we ended up down at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> , which was pretty crowded, had lots of prisoners there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And then we heard rumors about the allies not too far away, and they — they had radio there too, you know, their secret radios, they had crystal sets. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And I heard — we were told that — that if they tried to evacuate us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> to be — light a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on fire or something, cause they’d have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> circling. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And we noticed that at about 35,000 feet or something, way up in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , we’d hear these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , and once in a great while you could see one of them, but they’re — just barely see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And they were — April 26, 2013 circled day and night, and they said, light a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on fire, something, if anything — they started to kill anybody or anything like that, and they would make an immediate attack on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And we were shocked one day was — I was down by the <span class="DLF">gate</span> cause there was a lot of commotion and stuff and the Germans were coming by, and there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> rolling by and everything else, and I think Captain he — and Captain Daniels was down there close to me too, and the German guards all of a sudden were running to a — one the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , their — their little <span class="BUILDING">guard shack</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And — and then we saw what was happening, the SS guy there, there was tank people out there, were telling the — motioning them to come out and help fight, I guess, cause we were right down there by the <span class="DLF">gate</span> watching them, and all of a sudden one of these Germans put a Panzer fist, a German anti-tank gun right into those — his own guys, those Luftwaffe guys at the — at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there, just blew it wide open. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Holy mackerel, you know, what’s going on, cause all <span class="NPIP">hell</span> was breaking loose, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">You hear gunfire and cannon fire and everything else, and the Americans were shelling pretty high with large cannons, because you could look up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> and see the tar sliding off the roofs of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So, was pretty noisy for a while, and all of a sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> started coming by and we saw the goings on, and — and it wasn’t five minutes behind the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , here come Patton, riding in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It’s ju — standing up in April 26, 2013 his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and he motioned they — he motioned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> or something, break down the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , he come driving right inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and stood up in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and told everybody, you know, to be quiet or something. </span><span class="sentence"

<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Can’t explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Just being <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know, it’s a great thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And seeing the family, and then the — I stayed in the — I wasn’t — I wasn’t discharged yet, but I was able to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I worked with GCA — Ground Approach Systems, cause Gilfillan was building radars and stuff for ground approaches, training, and I was April 26, 2013 still in the military, so I went to <span class="DLF">Mines Field</span> which is <span class="BUILDING">LA International Airport</span> , but the military side of it, and I— we’d go there every day and worked to put radios in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and tune them up and stuff like that, cause the pilots were practicing landing with that new radar Gilfillan built. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So I worked there for, I don’t know, a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">At first I was assigned — I ga — got to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and then I was at — at — got to what was it, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Monica</span> , at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> out there, and then — but I wasn’t required to stay there, I had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tel — <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> , but they said I could live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> if I wanted to, so I just lived at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And I’d drive out to ma-march — <span class="DLF">Mines Field</span> every day at <span class="BUILDING">LA International Airport</span> , and so I don’t know how long I worked there until I got out of the service, and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Bernardino</span> , and I was discharged from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But in the meantime I’d read in the paper and the magazines about television and some stuff, and Dr. se — de — Lee De Forest, who invented the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacuum tube</span> and Sanabria, his cohort had formed an engineering, electrical engineering and <span class="BUILDING">TV school</span> in — on — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And so I got ahold of them and wanted to know if I could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and get a degree in electrical engineering and learn TV and stuff like that, and so I signed up for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So I went to s —I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> three days after I got discharged out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Bernardino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So I went right to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and got out of there — went there f— about three years and got out, and the first thing I did was — cause TV was just coming on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , I went April 26, 2013 in the TV business. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I went to work for a guy that was — bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TV</span> , and then went in it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And RCA was advertising they were gonna make a — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">projection tube</span> , five inch projection tube. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And they’d had a little 10 inch <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table model TV</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And Bausch and Lomb was talking about a lens for this RCA thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So I was inquisitive, I called them up and asked RCA if I could get is — one of those tubes, and called Bausch and Lomb, see if I could get a lens, and I did it, and I took a 10 inch RCA TV and converted it to — made a little projection set. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I put a 12 by 16 foot projection set in the <span class="BUILDING">Shrine Auditorium</span> in 1947 for the Rose Bowl game and the Rose Parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I sold 200 and — I sold 2400 s — I think — no, s — fe — was it — about a thousand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> anyway, at two dollars and 40 cents apiece for the whole Rose Bowl game and the Rose Parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I — I — I was sweating that, because I had two of these little TV projector things made up, and with a RCA chassis because if one failed, I thought I’d re — I’d get shot if something happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But I went to Bodie(ph) plastic screens, I could contact a guy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> that — cause I knew they made — you know, they had their experimental <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TVs</span> and ther — not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TVs</span> , but projections up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">They already project them from the rear. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">So I got ahold of this Bodie(ph) plastic screen guy out in — 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> , made the screens, and asked him if he can make me a screen. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So I had a 12 by 16 foot, they made a wooden frame and put this plastic on it, and they s — they’d put the projector back there and ha-have a hot spot, and April 26, 2013 they’d spray with a — like a spray gun with plastic, and it would make it thicker in the center, so 1t made it even, the light even. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Wouldn’t have a hot spot in the center. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So I parj — project it from the rear, and had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I didn’t have any complaints at all, and all these people over there got to see the Rose Bowl game. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I made money and —

<p><span class="sentence" id="837">ANSWER:  The only thing I’d like to say is, ve been very interested in the school system for a long time, cause I have had a couple of kids go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">My wife and I were both involved heavily in the — going to school board meetings and stuff, and I was astonished at all — how little history and real information is being given and the — the — I don’t think the teaching professions care much about this type of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I’ve always felt, and I’ve heard many years that those who forget history are deemed to relive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And it scares me that the young people today know very little about that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And it’s — it’s maybe it’s — a lot of 1t’s kind of nasty, but I-I just think that — that the school systems and the <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> even are — I’ve talked to a lot of college professors and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Like, my older son used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell me what the college professors are saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And it just disturbed me that they are not more knowledgeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">They should be, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And I just — that’s part — it just bothers me that they’re not educating the kids to really — what really went on in history, cause they don’t even teach, I don’t think, good old-time history, how this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was founded, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Our freedoms that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">If you go to — if you’ve traveled much, and a lot of people haven’t — I have, quite a bit in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and see how they operate and what’s going on, and this is still the April 26, 2013 greatest <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there is, and the freedoms we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But they seem to be gradually taken away from us, and the — things now are happening today that disturb me greatly, because it’s just that little encroachment upon these little liberties and little things, they’re just going away, and th — though that’s not right, you know, this, that and the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">But this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> didn’t grow, it didn’t grow financially — it’s been the most successful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And why people can’t see that — to me it’s obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And why do people from all over the world want to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And that bothers me a great deal, that we don’t — I don’t know, it just — I’m just disturbed by the way our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> seems to be going, and that fact that young people don’t really know anything about history. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">That part bothers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">My grandkids, I’m glad to say that I— I was able last year in April to — when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and — by invitation of the Germans; my wife and I; my younger son and my grandkids; we took them, we went there, they were — spent a week at <span class="REGION">Buchenwald area</span> , hearing all the speeches and seeing the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and seeing all the history that took place there. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And they were — my dau — granddaughter 1s fif — just turned 15, she’s old enough to understand, she asked a lot of questions, so she was inquisitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I just think more kids need to know about what really went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I know that some of it is nasty and bad, but that’s life. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And protecting them and saying everything’s just hunky dory and sm-smiley roses all the time is not the way real April 26, 2013 life is. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So that part bothers me, I just — I-I just have strong feelings about our school system and things like that, I— I’m bothered enough [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">But it does, it bothers me a great deal that even grown-up people don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And [indecipherable] today, a lot of people still deny the Holocaust happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">How can they deny it with so much evidence and — and everything? </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And yet people, th-they seem to have their head in the sand, to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And maybe I’m just an old — ignorant old man, but I-I feel that people need to o-open their eyes and look around, cause we sure don’t want to relive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Anyway, that’s my feelings, I just — you’re stuck with them.</span></p>
