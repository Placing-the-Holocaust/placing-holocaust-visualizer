beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">So I went every single week, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They didn't have no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They give a little potatoes, a little beans, a little flour, you know, until some...one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span

id="390">I never slept in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">There was a lot of old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Everybody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">My mother was a wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They said, "Give me Toby for the night." </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They were afraid to sleep by theirself. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Every single night...I don't know, my mother, she let me go from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to...whoever wanted, she...she wanted to please the people and I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It wasn't such a clean <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but I...I still went and I didn't complain. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I did a lot for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I wanted to help, and I did it and I very happy I could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I'm gonna go back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , you know, from the...from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So my child was then 3 and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He used to play with my brother the the chess. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">A...a chess...you

of jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So I said, "Before we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I hide this. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I make a package. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I had my mother's jewelry and my jewelry and I...I put away...not I knew where it is, that nobody can find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So he said, "Toby, you have a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I go with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Take your jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">For a ring, for a earring, you could buy a bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">You could buy milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You...you'll be able to survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So we went out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">When they catch us, they would...uh...shoot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But we went away four people. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I took my jewelry, and I was very happy I brought it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Then we hear the people, before they go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , they take away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So I said, "What I'm gonna give them the gold, my jewelry?" </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So there was a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">She was a friend with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">She was very rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Her father has a big <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> near them was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So the girl told my brother, "You have...I know you have the jewelry." </span><span class="sentence" id="431">He told her, you know, I have my jewelry here. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">She said, "GlIve it to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They have a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and she hides her things and she's gonna hide our things and when we come back, we gonna have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So she begged my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He said, "Booda, please come see where I put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Nobody knows whose gonna come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So my brother thought, you know, maybe nobody's gonna take it, they're gonna think he took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So he didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I met her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that girl, and I begged her. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I said, "Please, tell me where did you put the jewelry." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">She said, "I'm not gonna tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And she never survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We came back, me and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We went through the whole <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="456">People were dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">People were screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It was smelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">You could die. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">You know, it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We begged a little waters from the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Nobody was hearing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We came down from this...we were so happy they opened the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They start to hit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Go there, Go there, Go there, Go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Everybody wanted to be with their families we should lose each each. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We should be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So I.... had my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I was really beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And a man then went this side to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">He said, "Give away the child for a older lady." </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So I asked him why. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I told my brother, "Booda,
