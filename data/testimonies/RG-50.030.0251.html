<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My full name today 1s Gerta Wilchfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born on the 24th of April in 1923 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> is in today and...
QUESTION:  What is your maiden name? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">What was your family name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Blachman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Blachman, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Tell me, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> when you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Tell me what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Did you grow up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Tell me about growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">What was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">What did your parents do? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">What was it like to be a child in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Well, I was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Had no brothers and sisters and I had my grandparents there. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I had my mother's both parents and my father's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And we had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Went to, to four years of uh <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and then uh to up to four years you have to made a, a decision what kind of schooling you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">You have to, you can go either go on to the unit to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> or you can go to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> (ph) and there were also two choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">You can go to a <span class="BUILDING">humanistic gymnasium</span> where they learn Latin and Greek and little mathematics and little science or you could go to the other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We had, we started right away with French and the sciences. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">No Latin or Greek but French, modern languages, French and later English. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But you had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> very little was exams, even then at ten years of age we had a whole day of exam to be able to get into this <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So I passed that exam and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That was already uh shortly before Hitler came to power so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> for girls only. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And uh, I think right after, I don't know, must have been right afterwards that Hitler came to power and the anti-Semitism started right away and then I had trouble with some children. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Some children stayed with me and became very close friends and said don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But others started right away, I don't want to sit next to the Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I don't want to the Jews smell and I don't want to sit with her and they had uh religious instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">You know in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> especially they had a lot of religion and of course we didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We had still a religious, a Jewish uh teacher come to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we had extra, different uh religious instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So that set us apart uh right away and uh, but in the beginning it wasn't too bad you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">In in 1933, '34 it wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">As a matter of fact I was a pretty good athlete in sports, you know, sports and Hitler put a lot of emphasis on sports so, I think in 1935 or so they uh had like little Olympics for young people and all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they had to come and do a certain program and if you passed that program you got a certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So that swimming in clothes and a uh certain distance and we had to jump from a ten meter board and had to run and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And when you passed it I got a little, I got a certificate signed by Hitler that I passed that thing, so it wasn't you know, and the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , the the uh principal was a lady and she was very much for us and helped us overcome these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But after a couple of years or so she called me into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> or called my parents and said they are no longer able to keep us in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I either have to leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> altogether or go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So luckily we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> a very good <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We had actually two <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and this <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> was accredited like any other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like here the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Hebrew Academy</span> that is accredited now. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I I knew a little bit of Hebrew but I was always very ambitious so I, I had, I took tutoring to get better in Hebrew so I could be up to par with the other kids who had started there. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We had a lot of Hebrew, a lot of but all the other subjects I started where my English we had a very good English teacher and he was a stickler for uh grammatic and we learned very well the irregular verbs and all those things so we had a very good schooling there. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">That was only two years I think you know but it was very intensive and very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And uh I was a member of the Zionist youth movement there which, I don't know and uh we had meetings and we had outings but I was the private, I was the single daughter so my father was always protective and I couldn't go very much to outings and to things but I went to meetings and uh we talked about youth going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and to , to you know these little cans where we were prepared to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but uh they wouldn't give me the permit and the permit and so finally I, one day I said I have to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Zionist movement and see what's the trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So I went there all by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We had family in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> that I stayed with, and here they told me they can't give me the certificate, can't give me the permission to go because of my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The eyes have to I am very nearsighted and uh they are afraid that if I do agricultural work, if I stoop very much that I'm going to have, my retina is going to uh depart, separate from the eye and they wouldn't give me, they have to have consultations and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So I couldn't, I couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So when I had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my parents knew that we're going to have to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you know pretty soon, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was the custom that almost every, every middle-class family had a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So the kids would grow up, we didn't do very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We didn't know very much of household work and cooking and things like that, so my mother said you have to learn because we're certainly not going to have a maid any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hausen</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="55">That was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish household school</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and uh, I went there from in April, the German school year goes from April to April, not from September like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I went in April and I came back for some vacation in the summer...
QUESTION:  What year is this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  This was in 1938, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Yeah, '38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You are how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Fif... I was born in '23 so fifteen, fifteen, sixteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And us that was clear across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was quite a ... and uh I went back in September and in early November uh they had this uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on this on this ambassador so you know what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">On the ninth of November we were sitting near the radio and we were listening and we knew something terrible is going to happen but we didn't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And we were there, all young kids, young girls and uh so sure enough on the tenth of November that year the police came and the SS came to wake us up at six o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Out, out, out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You couldn't take anything only the clothes you know, we were there for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We had all our belongings there clothes and books and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They said no, no, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Get out, out of the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So here we stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and uh the uh direct... director and the teachers wanted us to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but there was no money, so they took us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and we stayed at the uh at the uh, uh <span class="BUILDING">station</span> till they got the money together. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We were maybe fifty, sixty girls from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to send and get the railroad tickets to send everybody <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So by the time I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was already afternoon and I was the only one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> at this time so I was all alone on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and really heard, heard only fragments of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So I had to stay over and change <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> on a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so I got there about ten at night and I was afraid to stay alone on the in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> so I went to the nearest <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and got myself a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and told them at five o'clock they should wake me up and bring me here back and went back to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and back on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And here comes a whole bunch of SS people and sit in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And start talking and telling the stories about the Kristallnacht how they were, uh how they smashed all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and how the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burning and how many people they arrested and beat up and so uh I got more and more scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">What will I find at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Will I find my parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Will I find, how will I... so I got to this, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> about two in the afternoon and uh uh the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was right in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and I saw already all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> the glass was onthe _ and here we passed by the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was still not burning but smoldering and I saw what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Nobody was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So, but after a while my mother came and told me that they were arresting all the men so my father had been hiding at his mother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because there was no men in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my grandfather too was not arrested, but uh most Jewish men were arrested that night and many in smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were beat up but I, I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then for the winter and we knew then and there that the time has come to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Before that time, if I may go back, I was fifteen like I say, fourteen, fifteen, and I wasn't so emerged in in daily living or making a living and I always knew that we're going to have a terrible end in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I couldn't figure out, you know, that they're going to burn us and kill us but I always had the feeling that they had in mind to to to have us die somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I always thought they're not going to give us any food coupons anymore and they're going to starve us to death and I begged my parents, let's get out, let's get out, and my father had a very good boss and he unfortunately loved him and said as long as you're with us we're going to keep you and you're going to make a living and he he put in a non Jew into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and did all kinds of things to keep him there and uh that of course was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So by the time they realized that time was up for us it was already pretty late and no other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> took in Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The only possibility at this time was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and uh my parents didn't want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So they managed, we had a cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and after many weeks of communications, we, she sent us a so called visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and my parents purchased us <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> (ph) uh the the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin space</span> on the Havana (ph) <span class="DLF">American line</span> , on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , and we were supposed to leave on I think was the 13th of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Now to be on the <span class="REGION">personal side</span> , on the 24th of April I had my sixteenth birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And my parents thought well you know, I had such terrible youth, at least she wants to make me a little party and I had a friend and he said uh can I bring another friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And my mother said yes, and I had some very good girl friends that uh my parents are friends with their parents from way back from World War I already, and so we had a little party, and he brought this boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And he had come from so and that's how I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That was my future husband. (</span><span class="sentence" id="95">PAUSE) Soa couple of days later these friends, these, they were two sisters and their parents left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And uh this young man Marcos (ph) said we'll go together to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to say goodbye to them, and I met him again and he gave me, had given me a book so I went up and I met his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I went up to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I went and met his mother for the only time. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And he told me that uh he wants to leave but his parents are quite old already and his father got quite beaten in this smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in during the Kristallnacht and he won't be able to go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So his mother wrote, he was also an only child, his mother will bring him to to the <span class="DLF">Belgian border</span> and he will try to go illegally over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He has a, he had a girlfriend that he met the year before in in some camp and uh her parents have written that they will be willing to take him as a <span class="DLF">border</span> and he should come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> already and he is going to try to go there illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So we said goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and he was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , and we were never going to see each other again. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So we went uh ... a week later or so we said goodbye to my grandparents and uh I must say that to this day that affects me terribly to think back at how we said goodbye to those old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You know, today I'm as old at this time, they were really old when you were sixty five or sixty you know, and my grandmother was a tiny little woman and she was not well and they just couldn't ... my parents thought we can send for them later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Otherwise they probably wouldn't have left them. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But there was no way at that time to take them along so we had to say goodbye to them and that was a terrible terrible moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And my other grandmother also. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So uh we went to the, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ...
QUESTION:  Just before you get to... slow down a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Tell us about your your grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh they stayed behind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Yes, they stayed behind and...
QUESTION:  What happened to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Well, they were eventually sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , this couple, my mother's parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , but my other grandmother was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">She was a widow and when she got the order to come to present herself you know to be sent away, she said no, I don't want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I'd rather die peacefully in my <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> rather than go to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and be killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But my other grandparents couldn't do that because they, first of all they were quite religious and they wouldn't commit suicide and uh they lived for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They thought they're going to help each other and maybe but and but they both died. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I never heard from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They never came out after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But my Grandmother Blachman, my , She was quite a lady and she always had her hair done so she had her hair done and she put on a wonderful, her best dress and she sat in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen chair</span> and opened the gas and went that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">People told us that after the war and we only heard about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But that was maybe two years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And my husband's parents, I still have letters from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They were sent to uh forced labor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> at first after we left and uh it got harder and harder and they had to leave uh live in smaller and smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and they finally were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> also and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So where was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Oh, we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and uh we, we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and you know, it's one laughing and one crying out because we knew we never going to come back and we never, we didn't know what the future will bring us but on the other hand we were happy that we left as a family and healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My parents were so young in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My mother was 38 years old and my father was in his early forties so there was still the future we thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And uh on the passage, going there was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I was sixteen and I had young men friendly and older uh, young men who taught me how to dance which I never did because in the Zionist Youth Movement you don't dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You don't put on lipstick and you don't do anything but think of working and you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I changed and I had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I played ping pong and I but uh everything of course was very innocent then. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It's not like today that he was already twenty years old and I was sixteen but he was a gentlemen and .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> ...
QUESTION:  Tell us before we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , tell us when you first began to suspect that 1t might not be a pleasure cruise? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Did that...
ANSWER:  Well, I personally didn't think of that. (</span><span class="sentence" id="140">OK) Uh we knew that uh the <span class="DLF">shipping line</span> had uh asked for return tickets and uh it should have told us something but maybe my parents knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I never thought about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">As a matter of fact when we uh came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> there was a big rush at the uh <span class="BUILDING">telegraph office</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that uh everybody was you know, the ship money, it was German money that would have been useless afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They wanted to send telegrams send telegrams back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But my mother also sent a telegram to her parents arrived safely in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You know, and they didn't know much about this either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  So you have come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Yeah, we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But we didn't really dock. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We were out un in the not too far but far enough so we couldn't even see much of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We just saw the silhouette of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and of the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and the . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And they told us to come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> with the passports and the uh the visas and uh to be admitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and they were all sitting there, the officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The Cuban officials had come aboard and uh they said, well, there are some difficulties or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We should wait until tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So we stayed another night. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It was very hot and very sticky and I think we slept that night up on the on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> because it was already unbearably hot and you know, coming from Europe and we are not used to this climate and uh next day, the next day there were all kinds of little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> with family. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There were lots of families that were uh split up. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There were some men that had come out of some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> that had gone out first and the women and the children had come later when there weren't any <span class="NPIP">places</span> on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> or they had small business to attend to or some reason lots of families were split up. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">This one family, Matulski (ph), and that uh we befriended on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> this lady was alone on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with three children and her husband was in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And the cousin that sent us the uh our visa was of course in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and she came and so a lot of people, relatives and friends came and hired little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and there's a picture of that in that in the book if you want...
QUESTION:  Well, let's see your pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Let's see yours.</span></p>

(</span><span class="sentence" id="165">OK) And this is a picture on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> where there was a party on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> uh on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We had parties at night and this was . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I think these, this picture is of my parents from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> yet, from, from before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My father was a very good looking man. (</span><span class="sentence" id="169">Yes indeed) Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So I think it was interesting to see this, this picture of this of these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> that this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> its... itself the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> was a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and came down the <span class="DLF">spiral staircase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I felt very glamorous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  We can get, we'll get other pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Oh here's the little picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Here's the picture where the where the relatives came. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You see it? </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And they sent up pineapples and they sent up all kinds of things and there was yelling up and down the you know and we were standing very close on the on the <span class="DLF">railing</span> and it was you know hard to find the people that there was almost a thousand people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So anyhow it became clearer and clearer that we're not going to land. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I mean you don't want to hear this. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Yes, do. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Yes I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  I mean the, the background of it was...
ANSWER:  No, the background we don't need but your how did it become clear to you that you weren't going to <span class="REGION">land</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">How did you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Because of the time element. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">You know, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> almost a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We were sitting there in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and we just gave up hope you know that the negotiations will come to an end and uh...
QUESTION:  Did Captain Shroeder (ph) come and talk to you at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  No, there wasa ~~ Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">There were lots of uh prominent people on board, you know Jewish lawyers and uh teachers and people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They formed a Committee and they were the in, the in between the people, the passengers and the uh captain and they sent telegrams to Roosevelt and to all over the world and they tried to get you know to get us going but didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So I think also the people that came in these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> uh let us know that it looked pretty bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And there was some few people, I think twelve people, that had, that were not refugees so to speak, that had regular visas and uh they got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> so we knew you know more or less we knew at the end that we're not going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So one good day we just pulled out you know the anc... pulled up the anchor and we left and this is the picture here of this cousin she's standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="193"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , June '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">She standing at the ‚Äî__ and crying and in the back you see the St. Louis pulling out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Describe for me the scene on board as you pulled up anchor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Well, if you can imagine there was a terrible mood. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Everybody was very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Few people committed, tried to commit suicide as I think uh the one man he, I think he cut his wrists and they, he was the only one landed because they had to take him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to to tend to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I don't know whether he stayed or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I think he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He must have been the only one who stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But you know, humans are always hopeful. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">You know, we always cling to the hope something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They're not going to let us rot on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I mean, something had to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Of course, the fear was that we would go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That was the big thing you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So we the food got worse and worse and the what ever water supply, I mean we had water but we had to be careful and of course the parties were over. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">No more parties, no more no more fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We were just sitting and waiting what's going to happen you know and uh here again the Committee tried everything and sent telegrams all over the world trying to get us in but was everyday they had like newsletters printed and put out on board to tell us what's happening and everyday there was another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> we were supposed to be going to go, but we never and nothing came about until finally at the we were already well, first we came to the coast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and we thought we could you know I heard later that the captain had agreed that we make some kind of a forced landing or something but we didn't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We just saw the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Coast Guard boats</span> surround us near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> to make sure that we wouldn't even come close to the boarder, to shore, so that was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So we saw the lights of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We saw the lights of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So we slowly sailed back to Europe and of course behind the you know there were a lot of negotiations going on with United, the United Jewish Appeal and there was a Mr. Tupper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and he finally got it together that we will be divided between <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And uh I don't remember very well I was up on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> not near my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You know when you're sixteen you don't cling to your parents and so uh when the loudspeaker came on and they announced that the first uh contingent of people will debark in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> uh you know we were out already in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And they announced the names you know that was also the work of the Committee they made the list, the passenger list and they divided the passengers to wherever they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Of course <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was already then the preferred <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because we knew it was away from Europe you know a little bit and that we had a feeling that would have been the safest, but not everybody could go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But my friend, this friend went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and I never heard from him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I don't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But we went uh to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Maybe my mother told them that she had a brother there. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I don't know how we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , but I ran back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> and my parents were already packing again and uh we debarked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We got off, one of the first ones and then the Paris Match came, the uh newspaper people came and took pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Do you want me to show you? (</span><span class="sentence" id="226">Sure) And uh we were all standing up on, on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and waiting a man saved his dog, he had to have his dog, and my parents happened to be here they're here. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">This is my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They were standing there, but I was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I had been running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So this was in the Paris Match, and uh you know, was a big story, newspaper story at the time in Europe that this first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the people coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> right away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and we stayed a couple of nights in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we were free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  You had papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Well, they made us sign papers that we were not to work and that we were accepted as refugees but that as soon as the situation will allow us to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we will leave, we will leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we signed to that my parents, we signed to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And forgot all about it but when the war was over, you know, we had to uh report every six months to the police and they presented us with this signature and with this promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They hadn't forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It was just filed away through the war and uh that was one reason why we left again. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They didn't pressure us actually but every six months we were presented with this again. (</span><span class="sentence" id="239">Oh, I see.) </span><span class="sentence" id="240">After the war. (</span><span class="sentence" id="241">After the war.) </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But we had signed that, we signed anything we didn't even read we were so glad that we were on uh soil and that we were not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that somebody was going to take care of us more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So here we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and after, to go back to my private story again, I we walked down the <span class="DLF">boulevard</span> and I stayed and I looked in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and I come and there's the young man and he didn't say anything and I didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to mother and I said, you know, I think I saw Marcos, this young man that came to my birthday party. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there was somebody sitting there and he said if I didn't know that Gerta went to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> I would think I saw her today. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And this man says, to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">What <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was she on? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And he said, I think it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So he said yes, you saw her today. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I was, I just come off the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and there was a Gerta Blachman and that was your friend girl, so we met again, and but he had this other girlfriend and but we were good friends and we saw each other off and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And it was really a big coincidence that we got together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and then uh by the time, by this time it was June...
QUESTION:  What were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Well, we had a very limited budget from the United Jewish Appeal to say the least. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And my parents, all we could afford they brought us, this lady brought us to find so called <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Well, we were, we had then one big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> that was used by the people on this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and the people on the other <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and it was not a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It was just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sink</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And we had to have the water from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">There was no running water in this so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So my parents let in this one woman on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> that had to be made up every night and I slept on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , so my mother was very anxious for me to get out of this environment and even though we were not supposed to work, she found me a little job as a children's maid in a very nice high rise <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and had normal conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I had charge of a little boy that was four years old, three or four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And it was away from them but you know, it was better for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And uh so by uh I was there the whole winter, the whole winter until the 10th of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I woke up and I heard the noises and there were bombs coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And I was way up in the you know, in the little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the top of the tilted <span class="DLF">roof</span> so I was pretty high up and I heard the I heard the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I went back to my, to the people in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I said what's happening, what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The Germans attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So the husband was also German-born. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">She came from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> but he was also German- born. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But they, you know we were just there a few months and we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We didn't know much what was going on but he knew somebody told him maybe from the police or something that they're going to arrest all the German men. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The German Jews or non-Jews but because of the first column of spies. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They were afraid of spies so they had orders to arrest all German men and he went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He said he's sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And he said go and call your parents and tell your father to do the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I don't remember anymore that they didn't have a phone I just see myself running through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> to a for a <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> for a telephone which was quite far and calling my parents and telling them the same, to do the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And they wouldn't believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They said ah stories are... you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We weren't use to doing things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Everything had to be on the up and up. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So he didn't do it and two days later they made arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They got into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and they sent me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and...
QUESTION:  Who got...who they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  This this couple with the little boy. (</span><span class="sentence" id="285">OK) You know she came from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , or they went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I mean they saved themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I saw them again after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They passed, they spent the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I don't know exactly how they got there but they left everything standing there and they got into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I think they had their own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And they said we can't take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">You go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I see, I remembered going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I think even by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> because I think by that time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> weren't even running anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my mother is there and they had already taken my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So I never saw my father anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They had taken him in the uh to the to you know, where the soldiers live. (</span><span class="sentence" id="297">A <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> ?) </span><span class="sentence" id="298">A <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> , yes, and they had all these people, all these men assembled there and my friend Marcos had been just sixteen so sixteen was the cutoff age and he was on the <span class="DLF">street</span> just walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">He didn't have a toothbrush. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He didn't have a shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">He didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They took him off the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">My father they let pack at least a little, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They took him off the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he was with my father and all the other Germans in the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And uh...
QUESTION:  How did you and your mother handle that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Well, we tried, you know we packed up things and we packed up things and we took it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We couldn't get in and then they said, the next day they said they going to be transported to south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> leaves on so and so, so we went early in the morning and we saw them marching through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We saw them going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So I really wanted they said they're going to take them to south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> away from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Well the war accelerated but communication was so bad we didn't know in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> that they had attacked <span class="DLF">line</span> and they to take <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We just thought they just had taked <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">You know, there was no television. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">There was hardly any newspaper at that time and our French wasn't that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We didn't read the newspaper every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And we didn't know anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  You didn't have a radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  Yeah, but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I, maybe they didn't uh communicate that I'm pretty sure we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So I persuaded my mother we'll go with you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We'll go, try to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or try to find my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">This is usually; it takes today a half hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">At that time it took maybe three quarters of an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">There were already really good <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It took all day and we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> it was dark and it was full of glass from the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was worse there than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And uh, but there were we weren't the only ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">There were thousands of refugees you know so they herded us to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and we spent the night there. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They gave us shelter and uh they gave us breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And it was a terrible night that we'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">You know, the bombs were flying and uh we were there down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and uh with hundreds of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So in the morning we got up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and here again everything was covered with glass and the only way to go to the <span class="DLF">French border</span> was the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> , the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> that went all the way the co... all along the <span class="DLF">coast</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> I don't remember any more the last <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , uh, all little resort places that all along the <span class="DLF">coast</span> and that <span class="DLF">tramway</span> used to you know connect these little <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So we went to the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> till we found a young boy there that had lost his from this Mrs. Matulski (ph) that was with us from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and one of the three children she had gone the same route without us knowing it and she was there in the morning waiting for the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> and she was a very nervous person, boom boom, she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> with the girl and the boy was a little slower and he was standing there, and so we took him along and we eventually found the mother and the other girl and so we stayed together on this trip, on this what we called the and again something personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">When we got out of this <span class="DLF">tramway</span> even though I was on the St. Louis and we were four weeks on this, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , I had never been on the uh on the shore of the of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">You know, never seen the <span class="DLF">beach</span> like that on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and it was in evening and I really remember that that was such an incredible sight, and you know, the peacefulness and in the midst of all this uh turmoil and war and running and then there was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , untouched and <span class="DLF">beach</span> and the sunset and this is something I have never forgotten in all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So we tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I was almost a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I was you know and the two ladies and the two children and uh they said the <span class="DLF">French border</span> is closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">No body can go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But we couldn't go back either. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We couldn't go back and we couldn't go forward, so we stayed in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> and waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Then one day they said, tomorrow they're going to open the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So from there to the <span class="DLF">border</span> was still a ways to walk, but we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">That was the only, the only way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">There was no transportation and there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> or anything so if you can picture this, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of people walking to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and they thought across the <span class="DLF">border</span> will be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It's <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So here comes the famous story of my mother's silver fox. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We come to the, to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and you know, we didn't have much luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We didn't have anything, you know, but she wanted the silver fox and she had it like just a stole like so when we came to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we showed our German papers, he said, oh no, you can't go through here with German papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">You go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">You can't, we won't let you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So as the and then the people were pushing from the back and there was a young boy with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and somehow that wonderful silver fox got tangled up in the uh in the wheels of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and my mother ran after him. ; . , </span><span class="sentence" id="357">and you know things have sometimes very funny undertones you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So saved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The silver fox, and we were all holding hands, and all five of us ran through with the silver fox. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Well it wasn't such a wonderful thing you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It wasn't any different over there than in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It was exactly the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">There were thousands of people and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> with with uh wheelbarrows pushing their little belongings, with baby carriages, with any way they could you know, go along and bring things. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And so we stayed one night in a <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> and they had a great big pot in the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> and they made one big pot of soup and everybody had a spoon went in there and ate and uh was pretty tough you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And we knew that the Germans are behind us and how can you run away from the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I mean the German army was uh on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">How can, you know, but we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We walked and then one day we walked around a <span class="DLF">highway</span> and I heard, we heard the uh German uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> over us and that was really the first, the only time I was really really afraid because they they uh machine gunned all the refugees right on this <span class="DLF">highway</span> and I pulled my mother and said, let's go, and there was a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We didn't even ask can we come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We just went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And we, all five, we were always together with this lady with the two children, and uh we stayed there and they let us in and you know, we stayed there a couple of hours and here come the Germans marching in. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Now we weren't too thrilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But we couldn't stay in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they didn't have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> you know, so after, we stayed a few hours I think and after a while we walked on and there was a like a chateau, like a big <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> like, you know, not a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , but a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> and we went in there and there was an old lady and she was also ; she said yeah, yeah, I speak a little Flemish and I speak a little German and I speak a little French, and she said, yeah, you can stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And uh we stayed maybe one night or maybe not even a night when the Germans came there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And they wanted to make the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> there, so the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> then we had to leave regardless of who we were, but they didn't want any civilians there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  But they didn't stop you because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They didn't even know that we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But uh they had, she had a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> for the uh servants before, and she said you go and stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So we stayed there, and, but there was nothing to eat and we were five people and there was nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The little girl went to, into the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> and the chicken coops and she got some eggs but you know it was so much, so my mother said I don't think, they, they are very delirious now with their victory. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">They walked all over Europe you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They're not going to do anything horrible and besides I don't want to hide that I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I think we should go and tell them, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">You know, they were officers in this <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the whole <span class="REGION">region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And so she went and she didn't actually say Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">She said we are German refugees she just said and let them figure out what they want to figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And we asked, we are two children, three children and we have nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Later on maybe you can do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And they were very polite and very nice and they sent us bread and they sent us all kinds, you know whatever they had rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And so we stayed there a few days and uh then there were some soldiers that uh TECHNICAL CONVERSATION and uh there was one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> who was actually a Communist ‚Äî__ you know from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and they were from the <span class="DLF">waterfront</span> , and he came and he helped us and they raided the uh the uh <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has a lot of wine, so instead of water he gave us the wine and the kids drank the wine and we were half drunk after a whole week because there was no water but wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And that was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So anyhow after a week of that we said well, what we going to do, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So this guy and also that soldier got me a wheelbarrow and he got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for the young boy and whatever we had we put on the things and started walking again. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So we walked...
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Let's hold it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Let them change tape, but before they do, did you have false papers, because you would have had to show the Germans something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Not at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  You had papers that said Juda (ph) on it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  They didn't ask us for papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Not at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">That was in the very beginning, in 1940, when they were very victorious and very, and they didn't have any uh any plans, any directives to do anything with Jews or not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They had this in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but this was war and there was nothing against Jews at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Let's let them change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Let's pick up you are leaving the <span class="BUILDING">chateau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">You've been there for a week now, and you are leaving with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelbarrow</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  The five of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  The five of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Well, we made it into the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there were signs all over for the refugees, you know, we can go to the next, to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> or I don't remember any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">But we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a few days and uh they fed us there more or less and we never, there was already an organization in place to take care of more or less of the refugees, but uh then we figured we have to do something on our own so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> again and we were already emboldened by this first experience, so we went, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> there and I asked for transportation back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now which <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  The Germans. (</span><span class="sentence" id="424">The Germans?) </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Oh yes, was all Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And uh they put us on the uh, they said yes, go down to the <span class="DLF">plaza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">There were lots of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> are going to , to to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> already but near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and they will take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So, cause you know, sixteen year old girl they all wanted to have in, during the war, they wanted me to sit in front with one and the other, my mother and the other and the Matulskis were in the back of another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , but we were all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I wouldn't leave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">You know, I said we have five people and we go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So we got into and uh we stayed overnight with a with a Belgium family. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They put us up but we didn't, we were really you know as Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They hated the Germans and we came there on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> , but what can you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">They had the advantage of the language at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">You know, we could speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So next time, next day they picked us up and they gave orders to back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and we went back to my, to our old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there was nothing there anymore and so, but Mrs. Matulski, the other lady, she had another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there was one empty in her, in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and so we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Anduh...
QUESTION:  How did you live now? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">How long, you stayed for quite a while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  Yeah, well for a couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">As a matter of fact, that's where I started uh my, my sewing career. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Because by this time I was seventeen and my mother said, girl, you'll never go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There's no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">You should learn a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And sewing was always my big uh strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I was very good in Home Economics and sewing in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in that <span class="BUILDING">household school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I was always good in sewing so she found two Viennese dressmakers who was who were established and they, they uh in dressmaking, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">To order. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">People came and brought their fabrics and so I really learned it there, learned a lot from them to do to do fine sewing and to do fittings and to do that's really where I got my first apprenticeship so to speak, with those two ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And uh my mother was able to make a little bit money and we didn't need very much and we finally got our uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> , this this box with things from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we got them out and uh out of the uh out of the they had been in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> all the time (in storage?) </span><span class="sentence" id="450">In Storage, yes...
QUESTION:  What was in the box? </span><span class="sentence" id="451">What did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  There was a very ingenious way of packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They had made to order boxes like like uh <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> and you know, on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> were some clothes and then there were shelves on the shelves and then, they were sometimes as big as a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but it was all one great box. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So I don't remember any more exactly but I think my mother had uh uh table service that she was able, that we were able to sell and some crystal. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">No silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">No silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">No gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That had to be brought to Hitler you know we had to, they allowed us two uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> settings silver a person, one for milk and one for supposedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And uh, but everything else including jewelry and silver had to be uh brought you know, give them away, but she had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , so she had beautiful linens. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">She had uh crystal and things like that that we sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Little by little we sold it and she made a little bit of money and I must have made some money there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Anyhow, we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> then in uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî_‚Äî=S.: Then she made friends with uh Jewish people who had lived there for a long time and they helped us and we got along.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Tell me about your, the papers that you had at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They were...
ANSWER:  At this time we still had our regular papers. (</span><span class="sentence" id="468">OK) And nobody really bothered us because the Germans, you know, that was the beginning of the Germans but, and the and the occupation and the Belgiums were kind of in the background but we got food stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I mean not for free but for rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">That we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I don't, I guess with our regular papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  You brought a Juda, the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Were you wearing that later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  In a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So in 1942 then they, the Germans started to tighten the screws about the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">First they said curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">You had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by eight o'clock at night when, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And then they started yes to, all the Jews had to wear this star out on their on their outer garments when we were out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And a lot of Belgium people put it on too in solidarity to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">In <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> wore it. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">A lot of people wore this to be, you know, in, to show solidarity with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But we were still free. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We could still go around with this or without it, not without it, you know, but this is, we could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Till one day there was a proclamation, all Jews have to go the uh uh <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> , <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> and register. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Just register. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So my mother said, we are not going to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">If they don't know about us, they you know, that _ I'm not going to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And this other lady, this Mrs. Matulski, said no, we have we have to, they're going to send us to work you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We cannot do against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And she did register, but we never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So time wore on and it got a little bit worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">All of a sudden it started with people catching people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And they, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> they took anybody that had this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They went on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They went in the front and in the back of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> , the SS, and nobody could escape and they went through all the people and we had, we had identification papers, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But from the lists that been registered they went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and you know, they had the addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They had the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">It was very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They went and picked them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So they sent them letters that they have to report, and it said for work only for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But my mother got around and they started to get rumors to rumors already that specially girls that they put girls in <span class="BUILDING">whore houses</span> , that they used the Jewish girls for the soldiers and that's all she had to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So she wasn't going to let us down. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We weren't going to go to any forced labor and we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But then one day this lady got the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">She has to report then and then for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It always said for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So uh she came, the boy came running to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Mrs. Blochman, my mother wants go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and please help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I don't want to go and so my mother went over there and she said start packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They lived with a family that had a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with, to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And you and will go away like here is punctual and you can go under false names and you go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Nobody knows you there and we will see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Nobody ever sent us a letter but they came closer and closer and they had these deportations so mother made arrangements we should hide like Ann Frank, you know, like in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> only we didn't have that much money and it was very expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">People didn't do it just for the love only. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">You know, they, they wanted to be paid and they wanted to be paid for the food at least and for the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so mother and I we went, one night somebody said there's going to be a, said it's going to be uh some you know people going to be picked up tonight so we went into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We spent one night there. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I said mother, that's not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We're going to go crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We can't stay here the two of us until the end of the war you know, alone and we don't have enough money to pay her so we came out of hiding the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And we had friends and he said, he got us into connection with the French underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">There were already the French underground and there were some uh English uh prisoners of wars that had escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and there was an <span class="DLF">underground route</span> to bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> and back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And somehow they got us into connect... into contact with this group and we were the first women that went. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Mother and I first. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Not this lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">She was still in the and her little girl was in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and everything was so far so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So, but we didn't have that much money anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">You know, when they only took you to the <span class="DLF">French border</span> you know and then you had to have some money so we got together with another, with a Belgium lady or at least a lady who had lived there, had a business there for a long time, and she had also three children ‚Äúa little girl was the smallest, was only two years old or three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And they said if you help me she said with the children on this trip I'll pay your expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So one Sunday, uh the meantime in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had started the deportations already. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And the people like my father and, they were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">had come and the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> wasn't free anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Was also German. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So they got all the non-Jewish Germans out of this camp and took the Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> was this camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> from where the French Jews were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It's a... so we wanted to go on a Sunday and on Thursday morning we get a card, a postcard from my father from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So we knew, and my mother was very upset and she said, you do what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">If you want to go, I'll go but she was out of her you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So we left everything standing there like we lived you know and our whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , we had everything threes between. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Three blouses and three bras and three this, so we could change. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">One changed and the next day somebody, the other one changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And we only had little uh like an attach√© case, that was all our luggage because they told us not to take anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">But we had some dollar bills. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">My mother had some dollars I mean, at that time maybe two hundred or three hundred dollars which was a lot of money then, and that was the most dangerous if, you know, if they found this on you that was immediate death. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But this other money wasn't worth anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So this French, that friend, said don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">We'll do something so he took a whole loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Everybody stuck it in their shoes and that where the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> the Germans were looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But he was smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">He took a piece, a whole loaf of bread and he sliced it very fine and two slices, he put the dollar bill in and he sewed the two slices of bread together you know, so you couldn't tell no way, unless you really pulled it away, so we had this bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">You know, like we wanted to have something to eat on the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And he gave us, there's where we got the false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">From this underground uh from this underground organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">With different names and we rehearsed the names over and over and we were supposed to been born in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> or in so to explain our German accent, that we didn't speak perfect French. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And we got on this on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and uh with this other lady with the three children, and we we somehow got through. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I mean there was a control on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , on the <span class="DLF">French border</span> , and we, we showed our papers and he accepted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">That was we got through that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  How did you, you were coming up to the <span class="DLF">border</span> 
ANSWER:  Yeah ... in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...
QUESTION:  ...1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">How did that feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Very fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I mean, you know, we were but uh we somehow made it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We, we just sat very quietly on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We were not in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> with the other lady, and then we had somebody with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">He didn't, from the underground he didn't communicate with us but he had his ears open and he might have heard some uh people reporting to him from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> or, you know, and we knew he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And he you know it was either that or going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in any event. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I mean the alternative you know, wasn't that much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">We had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And then we came to a another, then we got out in the next, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French town</span> I don't remember anymore but there was uh border patrol and SS on the on the <span class="DLF">exit</span> and they looked everybody over and you know, they, but we got through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So we got the little <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> and we stayed overnight and then when they, I think next morning, we went for breakfast into like a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> , you know, this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French town</span> , and we were all sitting around and here comes, in a round, in a round <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the children, and here comes the SS, comes in and looks because we weren't the only ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I mean that the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and we weren't the only ones going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And they were trying uh to catch as many as possible but they didn't want to make uh very big thing out of it so they just went, came into the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> and looked and looked and our hearts stood still. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">It was like you know, like you're frozen in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">You know, we don't and then he looked at each other and he said no, I don't think there are any here. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And they left you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And you die a little bit at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So that was really the closest we came with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And then this young man told us uh we're coming very close to the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> now and they are even more vigilant and more uh you know, so he won't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He doesn't want to jeopardize the this underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">You know, they don't want him to, and we are on our own now. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But we should look in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there on the French uh <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> , we should look around and ask for a guy named Gerard (ph) and Gerard will take us over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">He knows we are coming and he will take us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Well, we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> didn't go to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We got off before and we were afraid to go all on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> so we sent this lady with the smaller children on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and mother and I were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And we were walking on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> with our little attach√© case and two women it looked kind of in in city clothes after all, and we looked a little bit conspicuous I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So the French gendarme stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And he really questioned us. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Questioned our papers and he heard as a Frenchman more than the Germans that our French wasn't up to par and we said well, we are from and we always spoke German but well, it was a long story and but finally my mother said, look, uh you hate the Germans don't you. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And he said yes, I hate the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I said more than you hate the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So, she said, what do you want from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Let us take our chances. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">You know, she didn't tell we're Jews, we're not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So he says OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I'll, he let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So we went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We came to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we couldn't locate Gerard. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And wherever we asked for Gerard they just froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The people froze up. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So we stayed one night and there was a lot of German soldiers in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we were very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So we said, well, we have to get out of here because here they will catch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So here we started walking again, and we walked up the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and we came up to a little <span class="BUILDING">country inn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So we got in there and we asked for two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for the two families and there we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I think that people knew who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">You know in German we have a saying when you die and you don't leave any money for the funeral, he says we're going to smell him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">You know, it's going to smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">They're going to have to bury us with a . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">SO we're going to sit here until we smell, till they do something with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They they got together and they called the uh, without us talking about it, they knew exactly what what we wanted you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Was very close, within walking distance of the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So uh, so they got the the priest and the priest talked it over with some people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and they talked it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There came the letter carrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">The letter carrier was going on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , was always going on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So they said to us, I mean we paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I mean the lady had . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We paid her for what nights we stayed and you know, and uh they sent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hay wagon</span> with clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">They gave us uh old aprons like this farm women are wearing and they hid, they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hay wagon</span> and the, the children, they were hiding in the hay and they gave us milk cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">You know there were milk cans on __ like we were farmers' women that were going on the, coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from uh milking cows or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And they hiding our little bit of luggage under the hay and they took us back; the <span class="DLF">highway</span> that was the way was back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Oh, I forgot to tell, I went back one day with this young man, with this with this boy, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to ask again for Gerard, and I found out that he had been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">That's why everybody was so afraid to even mention his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So we went back, they had to go back to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in order to get to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And the letter carrier, they went around the dinner hour when the German border patrol was having dinner and they knew exactly by observation what time, but still, to make sure, the letter carrier on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> went right in front of us, ahead of us to make sure that we don't run into any patrols or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So he went ahead and we came on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hay wagon</span> and they brought us to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we got out and we got, each got a glass of milk yet and that was the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was like a hundred years ago and I can still see it and they said well, that's as far as we can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">You go down here in the back of us is like a <span class="DLF">ravine</span> and there's a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brook</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We go over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brook</span> but there is barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">You have to go through this <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> or over or under or whatever, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Good luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So that little girl had a pacifier and we, we went down this <span class="DLF">ravine</span> and we went over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brook</span> and we went up the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and that little girl lost her pacifier and started screaming bloody murder, but we still made it and we came over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and uh but the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> guard had heard her all the way across and he came and he helped us and you know, and we were kind of happy, but my mother said let's go, let's go little bit further in. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">They can still send us back, and you know, we'll celebrate later. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So we got but he was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">In the meantime in the beginning of the deportations, the Swiss didn't let anybody in. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And they turned back a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But in the meantime, we came a little bit later already, the public opinion had forced them to take them in, especially women and children and we had no man with us, so he wasn't going to turn us back anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So he took us, I don't think to another <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">He took us to a little, to, to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there was a bigger uh <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> and uh we stayed overnight and we had he stayed with us and he even watched us when we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">He stood in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I mean he didn't let us get out of sight and uh my mother said by the way, we're not free. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They watch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">They treat us nicely but we're not going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So we tried to call our relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> but we couldn't uh commu.., there was no communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I don't remember any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We couldn't tell them that we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So uh we told them of course right way that these papers are false, and we gave them our right papers, our right names. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We had no papers to the effect but we gave them our right names and and everything and they were OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I mean they fed us and they were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And then in the afternoon, there was a bigger group of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">They put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it was a very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">You are in a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and they do with you what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> didn't say a word where we're going or what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And uh they marched us through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of and there must have been about ten or twelve of us and uh people were looking out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">They'd say ah, the poor people, the poor people, they're going to the I don't remember anymore but they uh we spoke enough French to know that the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> is a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> is a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but 1t was a different word it was different they said a different word that we didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Well, we understood pretty soon, pretty quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We came to this <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that must have been five hundred years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The keys were this big. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They had you know, thick <span class="DLF">walls</span> and thick and they, right away they separated this lady from her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">They took the son. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">He was only ten or twelve years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">They took him to stay with other men and she and her daughter went in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and mother and I were in another in another <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , and uh as a matter of fact the first <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> had only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and we didn't know how, so we slept like this, like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We had funny things that happening too you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">like I said the key was so big and the key <span class="DLF">hole</span> was that big too, so I was laying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> like this and all of a sudden I said mother, somebody is looking at me, somebody is looking at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">She said who's going to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So anyhow there was a prisoner <span class="NPIP">outside</span> that had it wasn't you know a <span class="BUILDING">penitentiary</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">It was an old <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> where people was kept and all of a sudden I see, there comes a knife with a pad of butter through this <span class="DLF">key hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And this was apparently in___‚Äî_‚Äîsor something that could order his own food in there and he had wonderful breakfast and he wanted us to have a pad of butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Oh, we had all kinds of. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">then we heard singing. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Hebrew songs, Jewish songs, singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And there was another group of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">They wanted us to know that they are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">You know, they couldn't communicate with us any different way, so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were, they had time out in the morning to make their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and to empty their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sinks</span> (ph) and so you know they kept us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , but when they were, when the regular prisoners were 1n their <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> during the day, then they kept us, we could go out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And they were great big <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> with and we met with the other refugees and you know, it wasn't so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And we, we got food and we uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> they had <span class="INT_SPACE">bathtubs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We could even take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And not everyday but you know, they were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know, the regular Jewish mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So one day she said to this, to the , can't I get anything else for my daughter? </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I said, mother, what do you think we are in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> what are you. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Sure enough a couple of days later he comes up with a whole tray with a little steak and other things and I almost died because all these, our poor prisoners, got only water and you know the regular food and here I had a steak, but I guess mothers will be mothers even in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So that little by little everybody was transported away and even this lady with the children I think got out earlier than we did. ___ </span><span class="sentence" id="683">and we were left just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We had Rosh Hashanan there and they had taken us to another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for, and the women were in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> but they didn't have money to put the men in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The men they put in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> there over night but OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">We were happy then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  You got to go to services?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  We got to go to services and they gave us a very nice meal in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , under surveillance. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">They were policemen there, but we met the Jewish people and it was it was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Yom Kippur we spent in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and there were a couple of men who held services in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We were, like I said, we could visit during the day and they held our food until at night and we got the whole meal at night and it was OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">But then mother and I we were the only ones left and it got colder already and we didn't have any clothes so there was one family in had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> , wealthy Swiss Jews and they always came visiting and see, to see what they can do for the refugees and uh when you know it got colder then uh mother said to them we really don't have any clothes and you know <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> is, gets cold pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Oh, they said, there's no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And he asked the prison warden, you know, can these people come to my <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and pick out clothes, and he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So was a very strange situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and mother and I we walked out and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and the lady invited us up for tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We had beautiful tea in the <span class="BUILDING">salon</span> with cake and you know, like real people and he took us around in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and he said pick out what you need you know, was for winter and it became a habit. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We went every day we went out walking and five o'clock we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">You know, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">But of course not for very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Then I got sick and we got to the Salvation Army and we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Salvation Army</span> a little bit and then in the meantime this Mrs. Matulski and her two children came the same way we came and she was a very nervous person so she took some sleeping pills and she slept through the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">She was, and the boy was already you know children have to grow up pretty quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He gave the policemen the the patrol their papers and she slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So they thought if this lady sleep so well she can't be very nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So they made it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And they were already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh like they called lager it was the beginning where people got processed. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And she wrote to Mother we are here and it's very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We even have curtains on the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">We have and it's not so bad and why don't you try coming here. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So while we were at the Salvation Army, we went to this to the police to the you know, and my mother said we have friends at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We wouldn't mind going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So he said Mrs. Blachman, I don't think you want to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I wouldn't like you to go there, but if you want to we will send you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So he gave us a policeman and we you know went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was worse than the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and in the meantime it's November and it's raining and it's muddy and they have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> out on the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and the watchman out in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and my mother got a bladder infection and the food was terrible and we had it was like almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And not only that there were a lot of people from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that we for the first time talked to and found out what my father went through and they told us that my father was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Actually that's where we learned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And we saw how terrible these people looked already. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">You know, we were still fresh from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">We hadn't lost so much weight yet and we looked still like people, but these people looked already like they had been through the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> you know, so so it was very depressing and uh there was nothing to do and we were sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">We had little curtains on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> but that didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So it became winter and we got, we were divided into different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and mother and I we went, and this lady too with her daughter, went to uh Leistahl (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="725">That's close to . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And in the meantime I think we had communications with our family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I think we wrote to them from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they wrote back so one day, low and behold I get a postcard to Gerta Blachman from Marcos. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Marcos is also in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">He had walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">He had, he was a member of . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Uh not a member a child in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> he was in an <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at uh one night they was going to be deported and the policemen came to the director of that __ school and said, send your oldest ones, the ones that you think can make it on their own, out tonight because tomorrow morning the SS 1s coming to take all the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So he was seventeen, eighteen, in the meantime and the director gave them whatever they could and money or whatever little, and he had made it to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Like over five or six weeks he walked, in <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and he walked at night and slept in daytime and he spoke beautiful French. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">He was very talented with languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Spoke a perfect French. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">He worked for a time in the French youth group and they had trouble with them and I don't know how he made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> coming from south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">He made it in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> he got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">He was never caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">He was never. _ </span><span class="sentence" id="740">and he traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> to his uncle and he presented he had an uncle or a relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> and he presented himself there. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And uh the uncle said I am very happy but you can't stay with me for the rest of... you have to go to the police and present yourself, you know, tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So they sent him to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but not back you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So he wrote to my relatives we had given each other the addresses so 1n case you know there were, and here he 1s also in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And uh so the next spring by coincidence he got into what called . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">That was also nearby but maybe two hours by foot from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And uh at that time we weren't allowed to go much yet but he sent, some other young man came and told me about him and maybe we could use telephone or something, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But anyhow we got together and that's really when our courtship started and we walked and walked to get to each other you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">It was down to and up through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and there were beautiful cherry orchards in the summer and the things were... Each had to walk an hour to meet and then we started walking because there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I mean we couldn't you know was a very strange courtship but... Sometimes we met in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the winter and we sat in the tearoom and had uh coffee or tea or called <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Was this bread and jelly and butter and coffee that's very uh Swiss? </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So that's where we started our friendship, our courtship when we got so we were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> and here I sewed. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I was sewing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I, there were also the people sent in, donated clothes and there were also some Viennese who seemed to be the best dressmakers and they asked me, I said yes, I know a little bit and there I learned some more. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And we changed, we altered the clothes, these donated clothes, for the for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And uh one day the director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> received a uh request, you know if there are young girls in there that know how to sew, there's a shortage of operators like operators you know for uh in a <span class="BUILDING">blouse factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> and they would get the papers on the working permission for such a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So she asked me would I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And I said yes, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">You know, to be free and to learn more in my trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So was very upset and very heart broken that I would leave and he wouldn't be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So the only way for him to be free was to become a dishwasher. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">That was also in shortage. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So he put in to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> to be a dishwasher and my, these people put in for me the papers to be an operator. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Well, the dishwashers were needed more than the operators. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">He was there in one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And he was washing dishes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> in a in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And he was quite a spoiled young man but when it came you know from at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he was an only child but when it, something had to be done, he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And he was alone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> and I was alone there in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But we stuck it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He came back one weekend to see me and then finally my papers came through and I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> too and we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I mean he stayed, he had to live there under very bad conditions and very dirty conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">You know, but anyhow, this is so many years back. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So we were there together again and uh I learned a lot in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">That was my first job as a power machine, you know, uh experience on a power machine and uh it was quite a strict thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I had to be there very early and I am not an early riser so I had to be there from, they just started to change from uh sixty hour uh from uh from uh six day working day to five days a week and that meant of course more hours every day to put it into five days you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">They started very early but uh we managed to see each other on weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But he had to work weekends too. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You know, in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> was a different schedule so one day he stuck himself with a fork in the dishpan and he got an infection and couldn't and they sent him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he got all bandaged up and he couldn't work so he, his boss said if you can't wash dishes you are no good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">You are fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So he came to stay with me in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next door and he stayed there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And my landlady was very proper and she got very upset and she sent no less the vice police after him and he got arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I mean he got taken in and they took, brought him to the police where he should have reported that he wasn't working anymore you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And he, they said well, what's you know, what's the story and he told them and he said that's my fianc√©e but we can't get married because we have no papers so he says, oh sure, you can get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">He says do you have any ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">He said yeah, my mother in law is here, you know, her mother is here and I have a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">He said well, if they uh certify that this 1s your name, you can get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So we got married. (</span><span class="sentence" id="789">Laughter) But he never went back to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Neither one of us got back to the uh went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">My mother uh became a housekeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">She got commissioned for a housekeeper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> and after we got married the first of May he uh went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">The Jewish community sent him to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to a uh <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And so we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">We were there together. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">We had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but a bigger <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a nicer <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and nice people and my uh my boss, my you know, from the <span class="BUILDING">blouse factory</span> kind of made the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">They came with us to the uh, it was on the first of May and there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> so we running like crazy through whole of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> , to the to the uh to get married and my mother was uh brought the flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">The lady had given her lilacs. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">She came with a armful of lilacs that was my flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And after ceremony my the uh my boss took us out for lunch and then in the afternoon we went to the rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We had a Jewish ceremony at the <span class="BUILDING">rabbi's home</span> and the , the wife of the rabbi had made cookies and wine and it was... Then my mother had made little sandwiches and they all came to our new <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So we had no dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">We had nothing and so this lady said what, you have no dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So she went to the <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> there and sent us our first set of dishes the same day so she wouldn't...
QUESTION:  Can you pull it. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Let's, you're, you're now married and we need some of the little ...
ANSWER:  Well, after the war...
QUESTION:  Yeah, bring us to the close of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Tell us what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">ANSWER:  Well, by then the war was almost over. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">As a matter of fact on the on the, I have a newspaper uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> , where the headline is Hitler is dead, on the thirtieth, I think it was the thirtieth of April, 1945, and then the, and the civil column was of our marriage announcement. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">It's in the same paper, and was a big headline you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And so uh, well sure there was uh the the landing in in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> you know, when the Americans landed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we were listening to the radio, but we were powerless. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">We couldn't participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">We could only listen and hope and pray that the war will end. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Then slowly came the news out about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but it came only at the very end that we heard about the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and what went on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">We had no, we didn't know anything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So we had no more, you know, we didn't hear from my father anymore and as a matter of fact long afterwards somebody told us, I don't know if this is the truth or not, that he was put into one of those famous uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway cars</span> and that they died in there, that he never made it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I don't know whether this is reliable truth or not, but that's what we heard from people who said they knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And my mother's brother didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="820">He was sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And my grandparents and my husband's parents and actually only Mother and I made it through you know, through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">So we went, when the Red Cross sent us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> after a few months, about six or seven months after the end of the war, and my son was born there three years, two years, three years later, and we actually all wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Ecuador</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I have an uncle in, my husband had an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Ecuador</span> and after that didn't materialize it was always a delay and all things so my step-father, my mother had remarried in the meantime, and my, the brother of my step father had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and he said if you'd like to come, you know, and we started working then we had to, started at the blouse factory after I had been working in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for blouses and I had uh taken some private lessons from the uh lady who did the models and who did the patterns. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I went at night to her <span class="NPIP">place</span> and learned that too, because the sewing alone wasn't enough, so I did this and my step father helped cut and my mother started selling and we had a beautiful little business going. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">But like I said they presented us with the signature then that we were, we had promised to leave and our status was semi-legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I mean they prolonged, every six months they prolonged our papers you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But we weren't citizens and then my son was born and he, they made him , not an enemy but German, and we didn't want our son growing up as German in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Today it doesn't make any difference I guess, but at that time that was the enemy you know, and having him go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or something as German, so we decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where we can become citizens and live, you know, and he became a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">As a matter of fact the judge made him a better status than we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">When he said, when we went, he made us citizens first and then he made him like an American born of naturalized Americans abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">He was born abroad, not that it made so much difference, but you know, he has an even better status than we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And that was very important to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I think we did the right thing, even though we liked <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> very much but for my son's life it is much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">They both educated and they both have wonderful lives and wonderful wives and children and they are full American and you know, like born here and this was the right decision I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  I think so too. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Thank you so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">That is quite a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I didn't know all this when I started. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview </span>
