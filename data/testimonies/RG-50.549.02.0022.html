<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  -- to people who’ve had -- have -- ha-had experiences, to me that are remarkable and this 1s just certainly one of those examp-examples of that, I mean, even be -- apart from this I’m al -- I’m -- I’m always want to do this -- do the interviews for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I’m always -- like to tell the people I’m talking to just how appreciative I --

<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Right --
QUESTION:  Although we’ll need to talk -- I mean, that shouldn’t -- you know, we should -- you should feel free to talk about [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yeah, right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  -- appropriate, but -- one thing that I wanted to ask about, specifically, just from looking at the other interview, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what your family was like fr -- you know, from -- from your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">What -- I mean, were they - | mean, you know, things like was it a religious family or were you -- you know --
ANSWER:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I think you couldn’t -- you couldn’t grow up or live in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , without being touched by religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">There were -- of course the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had undergone all these movements of -- when the reform movement started, they went to that one extreme and then they went to an -- the other extreme and throughout reform movement and -- but generally, a-around 1850 or so, Rabbi Samson Raffelhirsch be -- came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He was Orthodox and there was an -- a t-tone of Orthodoxy all throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">The <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were -- <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> were closed on Shabbas, except for two <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> that were owned by Jews, but they -- they -- they were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And most people kept kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not the real -- Samson Raffelhirsch religious school, it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that had been opened in 1804 by a secretary of one of the Rothchild’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They had seen to a Yeshiva Baharim and walking around and they f -- and Rothchild felt they should have a -- a secular -- or any kind of education. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So he commissioned his secretary to start a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for -- for them and out of this grew a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Filantropine</span> , which was -- because of it’s beginning was -- had the -- had a philanthropic connotation, but by the time when my brother and I went, my father was joking that it cost him as much for our education as a -- what a German workman would earn per month. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Well, not quite, but, you know, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> really- also [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">Samson Raffelhirsch school</span> , they were always Orthodox and there was no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">This <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , when -- when -- it had started experimenting with Sunday schooling and with Saturday schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They didn’t write on Shabbat, but they ha -- they had <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And then they gave that up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">By the time we went -- this went on through the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">By the time we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was fairly -- well, the people who went were -- who went there were -- not the very Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So my parents kept kosher and we kept Shabbat, we kept Eviomtop, but we didn’t -- it wasn’t as the other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Now, but I remember we were 43 children in the beginning and I -- I don’t know -- I think one confessed that she didn’t -- that that family didn’t keep kosher, and everybody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So, if -- if that answers your question -- I don’t know if it’s enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I mean we -- my parents belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that was burned down in 1938 in the Kristallnacht, that would be considered, probably Conservative by today’s standards, even though it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">There was still the mareetzah, with women upstairs and men downstairs and other things, but it -- but it -- and it didn’t have a -- an organ like the <span class="BUILDING">Reform synagogue</span> -- that one <span class="BUILDING">Reform synagogue</span> that’s still standing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> now, but it -- it was a little less str-strict than the Samson Rafellhirsch’s sh -- <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And -- I mean what -- what -- how would you describe your -- o-obviously your fam -- I mean, they could afford to send you to that kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and -- and --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Would you describe them as -- as --
ANSWER:  Oh, just probably middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I mean, we weren’t ju --
QUESTION:  -- middle class or [indecipherable] class or --
ANSWER:  Not -- maybe middle-middle class --
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  -- if that’s what you mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I don’t think they were -- we were extremely wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My mo -- my parents were -- were young and my father had started a business, so perhaps if all that hadn’t happened, we ha -- would have been in -- you know, maybe -- but we were very comfortable and there was no -- but you know, I -- I can’t remember -- I can’t think of us as being comfortable in the sense that we would be in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because from the moment -- I was three years old when Hitler came to power, so everything was overshadowed by this influence -- you know, this -- this cloud hanging over us, so you can’t do even -- money wasn’t -- of course it was important, but money wasn’t always, you know, the important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">How -- how did that -- how did that affect your -- the way the family -- your family was together and the relationships within your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The sense of kind of growing up, you know, under this -- kind of this growing kind of cloud and -- do you think that drew family together or -- or --
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I -- you know wha -- I always thought that my parents had the perfect marriage because I don’t remember that they ever fought. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They were just always sticking together. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Because I think that the outside problems were so great that there were no inner tensions. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Sometimes I wish they would have looked more to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and would have wanted to leave and -- you know, and argue, I don’t want to be here any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">One of them should have said, “I don’t want to be here any more and let’s get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But they didn’t and I can’t -- I’m still trying to puzzle this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I don’t know why my father didn’t leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I mean, they relied on -- there were reasons that -- that I -- I’m trying to -- I try to understand, but they really -- their marriage really seemed to be like they didn’t argue. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They didn’t -- and they were very supportive of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It’s not that they lived side by side, but that they were really -- 1t was really a very close relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Thinking about that now, do you -- wha-what are your -- some of your thoughts about why they didn’t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  That’s what I felt, that they put up a united front against the outside forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But wh -- but why do you think they didn’t -- why -- do you -- what do you think about why they didn’t leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Why they didn’t leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Well, you know, first of all, everybody wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">People were talking about not going -- not wanting to -- well, of course, many people went for Eur -- to European countries -- other <span class="REGION">European countries</span> and of course, they were invaded there. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and of course, the people who were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1938, that the -- this expulsion of the Polish Jews, that brought on Kristallnacht, ostensibly, becau -- that’s what the Nazis said. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But they -- they were all destroyed, so there was really no -- no real point to -- of course we didn’t know this at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Everyone always said, “Oh, look at this crazy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Look at him in the -- 1n the newsreels, pounding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and screaming away at --” I mean, this has to end -- this can’t keep going. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Of course, it ended, but 12 years too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So one of the things I f -- my father -- I felt my -- with my father, was j -- he -- my famil -- my father’s family originated in the medieval <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And then, when all these things with the Reform and the Orthodox happened, the fa -- this branch of the family got tired of it and they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> and they became well known rabbis, the Sofa family. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">As a matter of fact, we had a megillah that was given -- made by the Sofas to -- for my grandfather’s wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And it was given to him as a gift, my grandfather had it with him, my father had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">When my uncle went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , my Uncle Abba, in 1936, he wanted to take it with him and my father said, “No, it’s got to stay with the oldest brother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And of course it was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Otherwise that beautiful thing would have been now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or perhaps with me or in a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> or somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So, my parent -- my father reali -- my father kept his Czechoslovak passport, because for business, when he traveled, the Czechoslovak passport was accepted everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="78"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was at the time the only republic in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They were highly respected and their passport was accepted everywhere and he relied on that to be able to get us out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which ultimately didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But -- so he, in traveling, h-he was comfortable thinking that, well, he hears from everybody that the Nazis would stop -- of course later on the -- this -- he couldn’t go any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">This was just in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But he heard that well, the Nazis, I mean, who’d look at this nonsense, this is going to stop soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I think that’s why they sat. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And people started going to S-South America and they wrote back such terrible reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They couldn’t wait to get back again and things like that, so I guess they didn’t want to subject us to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  It’s a hardship, certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Yeah, well -- what then -- in -- when <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was invaded, in 1938, I think it was, we -- my parents sold everything in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My father relied on his passport and we made our way to the <span class="DLF">French border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The <span class="DLF">borders</span> were closed, they wouldn’t let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We had to sleep in a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> overnight and then the next day we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I’ve heard of people who followed that same route, but they were adults and they swam across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> -- a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> -- illegally and made their way into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Now, my parents couldn’t have done this in [phone ringing] Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">What’s the next question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Well, I guess the next question is what -- what do you -- what do you remember about yourself, kind of as -- as a -- as a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What kind of -- do you know what -- what kind of kid were you, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Oh, I was --
QUESTION:  What -- what kind of -- what were you thinking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What were you -- what did you like doing [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I was very sh -- I think I was very shy. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My -- I have one friend that went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">His -- he survived because his mother was not Jewish, his father was Jewish and they sent him -- they didn’t send him to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , though if the war would have lasted a little bit longer, they probably would have, too, but he was survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he remembers me as being very shy and laid back. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But what I remember was that I was not happy in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I was the youngest, I was the smallest and I just -- I was just not happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Even though this was a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I mean, I remember the -- the little bit of Greek that we learned and the Latin that -- this was an outstanding <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it was the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in -- in Europe, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And whatever math I would know, I remember from -- from the Filantropine. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But -- so, that was me, what -- I was shy, I was always afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I -- I think I still am. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I don’t make waves, I don’t raise issues, which 1s really not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">What can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">This is what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">That’s what you --
QUESTION:  What -- what do you li -- what were your favorite things as a kid? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">What did you like to do and what did you --
ANSWER:  Oh, I read. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I read a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Well, especially after my uncle -- my Uncle Abba went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he left behind -- and so, I was six or seven years old and I was reading Ibsen and Checkov. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And when I did this in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I read it -- I ran into it, I said, “Gee, sure, this 1s what I read when I was a child.” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Didn’t quite -- but what I was reading, you know, for instance, Checkov -- Ibsen’s “Ghost,” I ha -- my father had to explain to my what syphilis was. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So, you know, you see -- a seven year old shouldn’t be inter -- shouldn’t be reading these things, but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So that was me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  And how do you think the -- the climate of what was -- what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time affected you -- your -- your -- you know, I mean, children are very sensitive to what’s going on around them and --
ANSWER:  Oh, oh, a definite ow, I mean h-how could it not have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  We were -- we had a Nazi living in -- downstairs from us in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we were children, we fid -- after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> if we’d run up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , he would complain that we ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">If a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> was moved upstair -- you know, he could hear it downstairs, so he’d take a -- whatever it was, a broom or something and hit the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> because we were making too much noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was a real -- you know, so it -- it was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And Sunday mornings, there were always these lectures on -- the speeches by Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , everything was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The church bells -- bells were going on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and Hitler’s voice was coming from every radi -- everybody wanted to show how good a Nazi he was, so they turned on the radios, you know, loud, so everybody could sh -- hear, and then what -- for whatever -- I guess that was the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And, so you could hear him talking from one <span class="NPIP">end</span> to another and it is scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Of course, to me, just the voice was scary, the contents I didn’t understand, but the voice and -- and this whole ambiance was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We couldn’t go swimming any more, because we were told there were at-attempts at drowning. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We had gone swimming in a <span class="DLF">public park</span> , in a <span class="DLF">pond</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Whe -- a -- all Jewish people, unless they went on vacation, in a -- but the ones who stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for any time went swimming there. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Then the public -- there were <span class="INT_SPACE">public baths</span> and you couldn’t go swimming there in - th-they were closed to Jews, but the other you co -- in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , for instance, you couldn’t go because there were attempts of drownings, so of course we didn’t go any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And people moved from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- Jews moved from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> to p- fi -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> because they felt a little bit safer in the -- in a crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So people came an -- into the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- new students came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Other students left for wherever they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It was -- and the same thing with teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So, they were always coming and going and it was -- it was not a very settled situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">However, as I said I was reading and I -- we tried to -- I guess our parents tried as to live as normal a life, but I guess I didn’t know any different, because I grew up with all that, so I just went along.</span></p>

-- in - where did they have, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , where they killed people upon arrival, everybody. </span><span

pointing because straight ahead were the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and to the right were -- was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man’s camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">To the left were the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">In back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man’s camp</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a g -- Gypsy lager and now the Gypsy get recognized, unfortunately they don’t -- they aren’t recognized as having suffered as much, but now at least, they speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">For the longest time, no one remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They brought in whole families, put them in the -- into this <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="299">I don’t know where they found all these people, but it was -- it was a horrible -- I -- I think -- the whole horrible to s -- to think that the whole family -- of course, 1t happened to our people, too, but there 1s was visible to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And that whole families were just dest -- overnight destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It was -- it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So this -- but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">When I -- when we walked in, there was a nurse with us, from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and it was a beautiful, bright day and the Nazi officer there 1s standing with their boots polished and their pure, white gloves and their uniforms crisp and f -- ironed and we saw a woman being carried on a litter and you could see that she was dead, except that I had never seen a dead person and -- I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So, this nurse said to me, “Oh, she’s just sick.” </span><span class="sentence" id="305">She didn’t want me to be so frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So people died at a tremendous rate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And, when they didn’t die and they were -- they died too slowly, they had the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , they had these selections and they brought in more people all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And the conditions were awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The f -- we had horrible food. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">In the morning we had something that was like tea -- I mean, they didn’t even have the color of tea, they called it tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I think 1t was because it -- it took on the color because the barrels that they carried it in were rusty. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So, that’s what -- why it was tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They gave us something that was like an inch of bread and like a slice that was about an inch thick and it was -- well, the bread probably was healthy because it wasn’t any refined flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Then they gave us a slice -- oh, probably also about an inch and a half of either liverwurst or salami. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And towards the end of my stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , one time | -- this was in the sum -- in the summer of 1944, when they were killing -- bringing in Hungarian Jews and they were killing them day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I looked out at the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and I saw the smoke going up and I visualized that my piece of salami was human flesh and I couldn’t eat it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I -- I -- whenever there was -- whenever I got the salami -- we didn’t get that every day, we got that like two, three times a week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Whenever I got it, I tra -- tried to trade it for a piece of bread, because I just couldn’t eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And then -- I don’t know -- I -- if we had three meals or two meals, but usually when we came back from work and -- which was in -- in -- the first work we did was digging in a <span class="DLF">field</span> and they told us to f -- to dig here with this decrepit shovel that was all bent and you couldn’t get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And then wi -- after they filled this in, we -- and it was very, very muddy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , there was a thick clay and mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So they told us to dig here and then they filled this in. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And then when there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> that we had dug, we had to fill it in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was designed to make us lose weight and lose spirit and with the few hundred calories that they gave us, it was a -- you know, th -- every -- people

<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">ANSWER:  Well, actually I was writing for some newspapers, so I pushed my nose into every -- everything there, and said, well, my articles were published in different papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I have to backtrack then, because there was one experience that I -- I am glad I had in -- in -- ina way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> had been taken there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Now, I had studied, in fi -- in the Filantropine about the Sephardic community and their history, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And there they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And, of course, th -- the -- they were ill fe -- I mean, they were terribly mi -- ill fed and filthy, I mean, just like all the others in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the - the -- the additional problem was that they spoke -- they didn’t speak much -- they didn’t understand Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Th-Their language was Ladeeno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">If -- when they spoke Greek and French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">They were very, very well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">The alleance was -- the <span class="BUILDING">French schools</span> were teaching them until they were base -- they were multi-lingual and they were talented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Almost everyone -- was -- had a -- was singing and dancing while they still had their strength, when we first met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And I made friends with two girls and -- can you turn that off for a minute?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, her name was -- let’s say Mona.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">QUESTION:  But that’s not her real name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  That was not her real name [indecipherable] and I don’t want to mention her last name because family was prominent in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">ANSWER:  So she -- we made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">She had -- was -- there was a younger sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Sister was about a year, year and a half younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And they thought that their mother had remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">As it turned out, later on when I met the cousin, he told me that she was deported a day after the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">But, of course, the girls couldn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And Mona had this beautiful, beautiful singing voice and she told me that she wou -- wanted to be an opera singer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">One of the things that the Greek girls sang a lot was Ava Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">As a matter of fact, a few years ago, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and -- and Yaffal and I heard Ava Maria played, so I went in to follow the sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">There was a young man from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> pla -- and he’s a painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">But he was playing -- I don’t know why they happen to love Ava Maria, which is so typically, you know, a Christian and a Catholic -- well, at any rate, while she had her strength, she alwa -- we b-begged her to sing for us and she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , of course took it’s toll, her sister died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And it was like, oh, all the starch was taken out of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">The -- the -- but while she was -- while -- while we -- when we first got there, we only spoke in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">That was the way that we were able to communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">She spoke English and -- but in -- the Nazis didn’t permit anyone to speak English, because they knew they were bringing in p-people from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they had to speak French or whatever other language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">But they didn’t have any prisoners from <span class="NPIP">English speaking places</span> , so, of course it was -- they -- if they had caught us, they would have really beaten us up or who knows what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">So we -- being young kids, that’s what we enjoyed doing, while we were still -- still had some strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So she -- her -- her -- but her sister died and she lost all courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">All -- everything, I mean, was gone from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And, of course, everybody got weaker at the time, so that had something to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And then this SS man, Talber, heard -- I think I must have talked about this, he heard that she was -- that she had such a wonderful voice and he wanted her to be his housekeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Now, the Nazis didn’t encourage sex between the Germans and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">It was -- would dilute the race and it would take it -- whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So I don’t know what was on his mind once she would have been in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But she refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And -- remember, you have to realize what a sacrifice she made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I mean, clean sheets, decent food and water and soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">She refused all of this and he made sure that she would not live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So he copied down her number and he made sure that with the next selection, she would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And then -- I always thought of her, because she was this wonderful person and we -- she was a fun person while she was still alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And when I went to -- a few times we had some Christian friends and I went to weddings and I -- they sing Ava Maria at a wedding and I’m sitting there crying and everybod -- they’re saying, “Look at this Jewish woman, crying over Ava Maria.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">But it wasn’t because of that, 1t was because I was thinking of my friend, Mona. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for the gathering and very few people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And I found out later on that they really being slighted by Yad Vashem and by -- it seems that the people who come from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> , think that they’re the only ones who suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And that the people from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , ah, couple of Greeks, we didn’t get a -- they didn’t get along in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> when they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">They were fighting, they were different cultures, different -- they didn’t speak the languages and they didn’t get along too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So they certainly didn’t get along in -- so then, still not getting along now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And Yad Vashem is not doing very much for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I think recently they have -- some of their publications have written about the Greek people, but not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">So, there were very few, as I said, people from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And -- but when -- in the last night, when Me-Menachim Begin spoke and we -- at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , someone behind me said that he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> and I turned around -- I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people there, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I think it must have been thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And I turned around and I said I had a good friend from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And he said, “Well, too bad you don’t know the name.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I said, “But I do know the name.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I mentioned it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And _ he said, “There’s a large family living -- by that name, living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">But he didn’t have any address and he said write to wherever and see if a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> someplace will find it for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">So when I came back, this was first thing on my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I called the federation and they were in touch with, you know, ev -- there was so much excitement in the <span class="DLF">air</span> over that event at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">They were in touch immediately with the -- a group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">There was no listing for the group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> , but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> group finally got me the cousin’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And we corresponded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And we met -- when he came, we met about a year or two afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">My mother was already very sick and she couldn’t come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">She would have loved to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I wanted them to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fairlawn</span> , they didn’t want to come all the way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I didn’t want to -- they were staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> someplace, very far up, So we met at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Theological Seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And we met and he -- he kept writing me -- kept sending me letters and he sent me the book of a mem -- a memora book of -- in French, of what happened in -- in -- of -- of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And the very -- but, you know, after awhile, there was nothing to write any more and wi -- and you know, we sort of drifted apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I don’t know what became of them ultimately, but it was a wonderful experience meeting up with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And he is married to a cousin and -- this was now another cousin, but the woman -- her eyes were so much like my friends that I -- it was uncanny and I was -- it was very exciting meeting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">QUESTION:  What -- you told me that there was a -- that the -- the meeting -- the gathering a -- in -- of the survivors in -- that that was -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">That was --

ANSWER:  Yeah, I -- yo-you hear it right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Do you want anything? [</span><span class="sentence" id="1163">break] I think that happened in -- at that gathering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">You look at my <span class="DLF">wall</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">These are products of Ethiopian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And it’s very funny, they take Biblical themes, but they’re all African and all their m -- the embroidery is made -- 1-is -- they have the dark faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">It is very interesting to me, but when we were at -- when we arrived in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , I think of -- 1n -- 1n tel -- actually it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> the first night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">A group of Ethiopian Jews were singing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And I became fascinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Of course, I’ve heard the story of the king and -- King David and Bathsheba and -- or the Queen of Sheba, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And they are -- they claim to be the offspring, so I became fascinated by the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And I became very interesting -- interested in -- in their work and in their fate, so when the -- there’s a new -- New York association for Ethiopian Jews, I started buying these and now they’ve become collector’s items, because when everybody -- while they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Ethiopia</span> , they -- fo-for five dollars a month, they were -- would embroider and the five dollars a month they could buy and feed themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Now, most of them have left, so they don’t do this any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , five dollars a month doesn’t exactly get you somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">So they have given up doing this kind of work, but what happened then was, I came back, I kept buying these things and all this is Ethiopian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">I have Rosh Hashanah cards and they’re very -- they’re very charming.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1214">QUESTION:  I was curious about when you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , how did the other Jews who were here -- how did the American Jews react to you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1218">QUESTION:  Because”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">ANSWER:  I don’t know, because Europe had a bad reputation over there -- everybody thought Europe 1s still the shtatel from -- and we came out of the shtatel from the 19 -- 1800’s or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And that’s why we should -- that was my experience, though there must have been other experiences that were much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Mine was not -- and even -- even my mother-in-law felt this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And my -- there was someone -- we were look -- when we were looking for a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there was someo -- a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in Elmwood Park that was an old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , very crummy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And we were looking for <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , this was not what we were looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But this old -- my mother-in-law’s friend sent us over and just out of courtesy we went and we came back and we said, “We don’t want it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">So, it was, Ruth doesn’t want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">It wasn’t just that Harry doesn’t want it, but Ruth doesn’t want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And when we -- when I said this, the woman said, “Oh, in Europe it was better?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">In other words, I was very ungrateful that I didn’t grab, you know, this old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And this is always -- I mean, 1n Europe, because most people don’t have the experience of the Jews living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was what they th-think of is Annatefka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And, you know, they -- they -- “Fiddler on the Roof” type of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where -- with the chickens running and the ducks in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and all -- and the mud in the <span class="DLF">road</span> and they think that’s what it had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And one of the other things that I always heard was that all Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were -- they were not Jewish any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And this was always cu -- this was -- it -- it hurt me because I just told you how -- that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> -- everybody was kosher, everybody kept Shabbas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">That was in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it might have been different in -- in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">But this- these -- these criticisms came from people who doing everything on Shabbas, who never -- who didn’t care if they eat -- ate kosher or not, didn’t teach their children anything Jewish, but they were able to criticize Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">So 1-it was -- it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">It wasn’t -- 1t wa -- it was not too great an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I mean, yes, there were p-people who were very kind and there was -- when I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there was one doctor, very well known dermatologist who wanted to take off my number and I didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I mean, he was going to do it for nothing and I didn’t wa --
QUESTION:  Wh-Why didn’t you want to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  It was a real part of me and I had nothing to be ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I didn’t -- I didn’t commit a crime to get this done and I just didn’t want to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Now, because sometimes I -- I put some makeup over it to -- to tone it down, because you -- if I -- in the summer, if I go to the <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> -- and everybody knows now, everybody has watched the movies and they just -- th-they start pointing me out and I don’t -- you know, I don’t want to talk to everybody about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And at first, years ago, no one knew what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">They thought it was telephone number or something and then it wasn’t [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So now I -- I try- sometimes cover it, sometimes I don’t, it doesn’t matter.</span></p>
