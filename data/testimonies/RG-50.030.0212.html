<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We were waiting for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We derailed this, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in three <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And when they start running out -- they stopped singing very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They start running out and they machine gunned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And then we retreated into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">deep woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We couldn't stay down there any longer because the Germans with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> right away they knew that the partisan groups are down there congregating. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They would come and they would cut us to bits, to, to bits. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So, we left that <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , we went out into the deep, deep <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And there was another episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">If you want it -- if you still have the time, I can explain to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And I call it also -- we

point, you put in a machine gun, some people with guns for people who are watching, coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or going out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , actually you can come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> but not go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">You understand...1f somebody...or he can go with a patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Let's say for instance, if the patrol at night was “seven,” and I would stand watch with my gun and I would tell him “four.” </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He would have to come up with the number three to equal seven, and there was on top of this, we used to have like “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ” and “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ” or “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ” and “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> ,” so if I would say “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ,” he would have to say “Kiev.” </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I knew it's one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">If he didn't know the parole, even the general, he had to lay down. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">If not he would be killed at the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I was in that group and in the morning the Germans must find out that there are partisans stationed in that...in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">They occupied this <span class="DLF">hill</span> and we were left without...without bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We had the machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They had — with

id="433">He was a snip-- a, a bullet straight to his head because the funeral was the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I tumbled. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I went, I remember, under a <span class="DLF">well</span> and it was like in old time, we had the <span class="DLF">wells</span> , you know, <span class="DLF">wooden well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And then I came to my officer and I gave him the bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And then we retreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And that was another
