ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And when did liberation come for you, and what was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="1">What state of mind, what physical health were you in, and where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  I was liberated in a <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> after the last march called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chinno</span> , that a lot of ki -- little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> were concentrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And the two typhuses broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And to tell you the honest truth, I don’t remember when I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I thought they were burning down the <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> , so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead around me, and I woke up in a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> , with the Russian’s doctor taking care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I had the two typhuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on it, and I looked like musselwoman. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And after three days, or a week, I don’t know exactly, they told us we have to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , because the front 1s coming on. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So we should walk to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polmarin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And it was not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chinno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> -- two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> -- officers, and we asked them to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> , and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we -- they shouldn’t notice that we have typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And they said, “No, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="15">But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind, in that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , but they said, “The first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> , you have to get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So, as we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> , the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they said in -- in Russian, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So, we went out, and the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don’t know, at that time I didn’t know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I didn’t know it was preserve, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">There was no water in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And sh -- she said, “Shall we drink it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I said, “I am afraid it may be poisoned.” </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Left poison, there’s that bottle standing there, there’s no water, there’s nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then we couldn’t stand it any more, and what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And at that time I was so young, I didn’t know nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was set up for wine, or something, and it helped the temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And our temperature dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and they was already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they’re grown up people. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> , and they were raping the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">German, Jewish, it didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They were getting drunk and raping them. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So what they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where they lived, six women. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And if you put a sign up that it’s typhus, the Russians didn’t care, they just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> , and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They start running. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , and there was a little <span class="DLF">pond</span> near that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and there wasn’t that much water, and anything, and I thought I’Il wash out my -- whatever I have, in that <span class="DLF">pond</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He said, “Ateeja dofka.” </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I mean, am -- am I Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He said, “I am too, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , don’t get scared.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So I took him up into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where the girls were. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, “Are you out of your mind?” </span><span class="sentence" id="48">You know, they dragged me back in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And it so happened that it -- he was there for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He gave me even a wedding band. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And I wasn’t even 15 years old yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But nobody knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la -- his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I thought to myself, “Let him talk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so nobody could get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And when he left, we went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , to help the Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And one day a man came up to me, and he said, ““Akeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?” </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma -- Marioshka Supporzhnikov. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I said yes. “</span><span class="sentence" id="62">My son wrote a letter at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you are here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> , and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I would like to send you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He wants to marry you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I told him, I said, “I cannot do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">| have to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have anything,” I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He said, “Do you love my son?” </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I said, “I don’t know him well enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I don’t know what love 1s.” </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Is -- I -- he didn’t know my age, he didn’t know nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Nobody know nothing about anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age, because my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I -- so even after I was liberated, I was afraid to tell my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, even to that man that was the fa -- and I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, “Tell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> than your son 1s, and you’re not even Jewish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name was, I don’t even remember, and he says, “You see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and doctors, and send us to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , because when we were caught from the Germans, that the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn’t give us out that we are Jews on top of it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn’t the only one that suffered, and there were other people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And we felt better, and we didn’t know there was [indecipherable] existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We didn’t know about people not going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">All I want is to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and see what’s happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Would you let me ask you just one quick question. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Did you know anything about your family members at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Are -- you know your sist -- your two sisters -- you said your two sisters were --
ANSWER:  My two little sister, my mother, was taken away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I didn’t know if they are - were dead, or alive, or nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I had a feeling that they were killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">All taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I don’t know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I can only tell you I lost them, about maybe a week after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But the only thing that bothered me 1s that they were taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is all in my other tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I was -- my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and -- and this -- I knew they were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My other family -- certain family members were all dead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But the thing is 1s, 1s -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So they said yes, they’ ll s -- they’Il s -- put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and they’Il send us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So they put us on big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and they took us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a good -- I don’t know how to say it in English, a <span class="DLF">ranch</span> , a big <span class="DLF">ranch</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palmerton</span> , it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nimitz</span> , near -- not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stetlin</span> , not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rigenwald</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And they took us there, and there were some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And the Jewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to clean up <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> , and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They didn’t give us enough food, the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They didn’t kill us, they didn’t beat us, but there was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with guards, like in the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The only difference was that we weren’t beaten up, we weren’t treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There were about maybe 10 Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And one day the captain asked me if I -- asked anybody if they would like to go to learn with veterinarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">There is a doctor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rigenwald</span> that will teach veterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the <span class="DLF">fields</span> that were running wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they opened a <span class="BUILDING">conzerr factory</span> , and they open a <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they’re healthy, they take -- to take analysis from horses -- I found that out later, when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I said, “I’m going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> , in those little camps, if they needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent to s -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I didn’t care any more when they took away my mother, my two little sisters, and the rest of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, “I am going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rigenwald</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rigenwald</span> , the doctor that they sent to teach us, 1t must have been from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> around that, but from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we went only one Russian girl, and two Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And what happened is is that -- what’s so amazing is that the doctor was a drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He was compl -- always drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And we learned some. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We learned how to protect when a cow 1s slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We learned how to take analysis from a horse’s neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We learned ho -- if they got this eye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We learned the cows, they had a certain thing on their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It’s a certain chemical. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Put them in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , and put them into the chemical. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So get away the sickness shouldn’t spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most important thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik’s wife, with the main man’s wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I must have had in me pa-part of it of my father, like I said before. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She went in a nightgown to the opera, and [indecipherable] others. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I -- I told her that’s not proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I told her your hair doesn’t look, let me comb it for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We got to be the best of friends, I and the Pot -- Polkolvnik’s wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And they treated me like a daughter the two weeks I was -- three weeks we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">After three weeks we got a paper with a pitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Akivia trinarn inyarz. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I was a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We came into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> again, we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We worked with the horses, we worked this. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Two weeks later, after we came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rigenwald</span> , they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in that good -- in that <span class="DLF">trench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">There was a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he said, “Akdere Marouska?” </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Where is marsh -- Marouska. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the captain said, “In her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the other Jewish girl.” </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He says, “In her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You mean to tell me she doesn’t have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of her own?” </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And his wife got very mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He said, “I want to call her immediately for dinner, to have dinner with us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Because there was dinner in the <span class="BUILDING">captain’s house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It’s a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big <span class="BUILDING">ranch house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So when he called me in, I had dinner with them, and he gave a order to the captain that I have to have my own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , that I have to be in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I have to be sent to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything prepared, and -- now, don’t forget, in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And what happened is 1s before I left for the other -- good for the other <span class="DLF">ranch</span> , big <span class="DLF">ranch</span> , the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have killed me, the Russian girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So what happened 1s is when I went to that good, I arrived, and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a <span class="BUILDING">milk factory</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span> , and at night the Russian soldiers from all around, from the good that I worked 1n, the ranch, from all the <span class="DLF">ranches</span> they would come, and -- and Polish soldiers they would come, and I would give them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russian soldiers weren’t fed either. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They would cut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with potatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Everything was shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And what happened 1s 1s that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the Polish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettlin</span> , and they would bring liquor and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But one thing would happen, when they would get too drunk, the woman that owned that <span class="DLF">ranch</span> was a very, very wealthy woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">That’s the first time I ate watfles in my life, because she had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> that she moved waffles around. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pullman</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">She was German, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pullman</span> , and she was like a mother to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So the minute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , and nobody could get near me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But I did a lot of things in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that a child of my age wouldn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was boar hunting, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I was boar hunting with the Russians, with the Polish officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I -- I did everything I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I run that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I was ride out, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and check up on the pomeron women, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  How did you know how to manage that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It just came natural to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It just came natural to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">In the beginning I was very ver -- I said I was going to take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">In the beginning I was riding my horse, I would see children on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I didn’t care, I was ride -- dust, the dirt and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But then about a month later, I was taking them medicine, and food, I was stealing from the Russians, and giving to the poor German kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  So --

<p><span class="sentence" id="898">ANSWER:  And Wiesenthal is -- he should live to 120, I have nothing against him, but he made himself a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I know him because he lived upstairs, across from us -- leef -- because this was the elite of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And across from us lived a name -- a man by the name of Ignatz. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We called him -- what -- called him, Ignatz? </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And he was prosecuting the Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And then Wiesenthal took it all over.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  -- you just began to talk about you work with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  David was born then, already, so David was born in 1958. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">The doctor said I couldn’t have children, because first <span class="NPIP">place</span> our bloods are different, mine and Cornelius, and I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They say the first child it’s nothing, but I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Also, when -- if you hear my tape in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , they took me into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they looked for gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And I was very young, and they did something there, so it was very -- the doctor didn’t want -- they didn’t want me -- but I wanted a child, because when my father -- in 57 they brought my father, that survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I worked so hard for the Gateway of Mental Health hospital in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I and Cornelius were fundraising in the valley. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So they surprised me on a television show. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It was called at that time, “It Could Be You.” </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And they told me I was going to have -- announce my fashion show, cause I’m giving for Gateway for mental health. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And they came to pick me up, and then they surprised me with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And what happened is my father came, and he came into the -- to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he says, “Oh, a Jewish girl, a bizdatnitsi, no children.” </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And it practically killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So -- and then my mother-in-law and father-in-law was in a very, very bad accident, and the two sons were so good, and they were so terrific, and that day I decided -- and I knew my mother was -- just has to snap a finger, she had a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I remember this as a child, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , she wa- a ba -- baby was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">She was made before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And I said to myself, “I’m going to get pregnant, I’m gong to trick him into it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I got pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And being that I am a designer, I wore a certain kind of clothes, that he never noticed it till about the third or fourth month, and then I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And I wouldn’t go to a gynecologist, but again, one of my model’s husband’s was a very famous gynecologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">He also charged me a big amount, because he thought I was so filthy rich, because of my <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , and his wife models for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I went to him, and I was pregnant, and all through the pregnancy we -- we did out <span class="DLF">garden</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- in our new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we did -- the front we added landscape, I -- landscaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I was bleeding, and I never told the doctor, and I never told -- and David was born prematured. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And I had the dachshund at that time that was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And -- and I had my little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bervis</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Van Nuys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And I opened in ’53 ti -- my <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , ameet studio in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sherman Oaks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And when I opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> is my friend the Vestliss’, they helped me, and who went looking with me, Elizabeth, because they had a big <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> in the valley, and we found that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and it was -- and I remodeled it in a early American, because I loved the early American, because that for me presented the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that I came, and that gave me a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And even in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in my first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I had the early American. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">In my little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> behind the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , I had the early American with the hooked rug. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And now I go a little more modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I got used to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Anyway, and what happened 1s is that I -- I -- I got pregnant, and I worked, and like I said, I brought my father out, and it upset me, and then when my mother-in-law was in the accident, I said when I’m gone there wa -- nobody going to be left, I have to have something. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And I stuck it out, and David was born in the eighth month. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And he was -- I took him out -- he was about five pounds, because at that time they just build the <span class="BUILDING">Encino hospital</span> , and it wasn’t far from my -- from my <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">So what happened is 1s I got -- and it was Monday morning, I got terrible cramps, and I called a friend if she could take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And she took me in, and the doctor said take her in right away, because I had -- delivering another baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And she was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> , and doing a -- she told -- I found out later doing a check, balancing your checkbook. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">That was all still Americans, not -- no survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I didn’t know any survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And the -- they came out and they said, “Where can we get hold of Mr. Loen?” </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And Cornelius’ <span class="BUILDING">office</span> always on the ru -- on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And th -- she said -- th -- she says, “Why?” </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Said, “Mrs. Loen is being admitted.” </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So I said, “I’m going to have a baby,” and all the checks were flying all over the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">My friend, the schultz. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Anyway, so what happened is David was born, and he was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">incubator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And I had one stitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">One stitch, because I was pretty flexible. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And then Fritz was sick, and he was in a -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarzana</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So, I had the people working for me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  Who was Fritz?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Fritz was my little dachshund. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And -- I took him out from a pound, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I gave him a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And he was a pedigree. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And he had -- his b-behind legs was hurt -- was very bad, so I took him to the finest <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarzana</span> , very far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So I would go and visit my baby in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">incubator</span> , then visit Fritz, and then come back to work in the <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  Id like to ask you just two quick questions for clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  It would have been dangerous for you to get a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="970">That was [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I -- 1t told me -- when the doctor was putting me in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- what was his name, Cornell? </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I forgot, oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  That’s alright.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  Oh, it’s -- we were -- we were so close. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">He was putting me in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , he says, “First I’m going to save your life, and then I’m going to save the baby’s.” </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I said, “Robert,” rob -- I said, “Robert, if my baby dies, I kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I went through eight months, and I’m going to kill you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="978">So you see, because I’ve done so much in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and afterwards, with charity, with raising money, and everything else, said, “God couldn’t do this to me again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And then, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was so small, and I got terrible cramps. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">It was just built, and they brought in -- in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> a woman from -- from surgery, she said, “Keep quiet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="981">That lady just came out, she said -- I said, “But I’m wet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I didn’t even know that you break water. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I never read up on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">So they found Robert right away, and he brought with him two doctors, two pediatricians, and he was putting in that stitch, and I said, “Robert, are you knitting or purling?” </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Because I design knitted clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">This is already under anesthetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I had a -- he had to give me a spinal because my water broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And then all of a sudden I hear the other doctor, “Is that you, Marsha?” </span><span class="sentence" id="989">It was Dr. Danielson, his wife was one of my clientele. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So you see, I was surrounded by friends when David was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And I took him out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">incubator</span> , and after six months I had to put him on a skim milk diet, thanks God. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And he was reading and writing at two and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">At three years old, he was -- he knew every president, he knew every composer. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Now, he was not genius. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I took him to <span class="BUILDING">UCLA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">My father-in-law was a very, very intelligent man, and David was his life, so he spent a lot of time with David. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">David has -- has a photographic memory, like I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I remember a lot of things as a child, don’t forget, that I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">A lot I forget because I blocked it out, but a lot I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And David has a photographic memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So one day, he was running up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> in my father-in-law’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and he says -- and he’s reading the paper, he’s running up, he’s not -- he’s three years old, and he says, “Appa, Castro is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Yeah, my father- in-law should rest in peace, it was his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">One time he took a wooden spoon, and he hit him on the behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I’ll never forget, he called me up, and he said, “Appa,” that’s an Hungarian father, he said, “if you do it, 1t doesn’t hurt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">He loved him so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">In fact, I had to take him to the doctor that treated my father, because the day before he jumped on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and everything, and I heard him in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> praying, and he said, “Please God, if I did something wrong, bring my -- my grandfather back as -- as a baby again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">So I took him to his doctor, to my father-in-law’s doctor, and he told him, Dr. Cohen, that his grandfather was very sick, he could not survive, that, in fact, the last day he brought him a lot of joy by being there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">QUESTION:  Did -- did you have any particular hopes or plans for David that, as a -- as a survivor that made a connection to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">ANSWER:  Pll tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I’ve seen a lot of things happen between my American friends that were always Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">If the son doesn’t get to be a doctor, or a pharmacist, or anything else, and those kids were very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I never told David anything about the Holocaust till he went to go Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">When -- when he wouldn’t eat, I wouldn’t say I was hungry, why don’t you eat? </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">When he didn’t eat I would say, “David, you have to eat, there are so many children hungry in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">He said, “Why don’t you adopt a couple?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">That little fat monster told me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">But I never told David anything, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I never exposed him to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">David played Little League. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I burned my hands on the making hamburger there [indecipherable] did in my life, run from the <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> , run to the -- to the <span class="DLF">field</span> , made the hamburgers when it was my day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">He played Little League, he loved sports, he did judo, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">In fact, he was -- when he was very little, he was very smart, but not coordinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">To -- my doctor, Dr. Jessup, told me, ““Why don’t you take him boxing or judo?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">So I took him for judo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So in the beginning he didn’t want to go in because he didn’t know how to tie his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So I told him, “Then leave it open.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But later on, this was the best thing that I ever did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">But I never, never exposed him to the Holocaust before he was able to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And I won’t tell any, any child about the Holocaust that is under 11 or 12 years old, because this is a very horrible story that happened, and it can affect their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And especially my son, 1t was important to me that he doesn’t feel guilty because of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">That he doesn’t eat, or he doesn’t eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">He didn’t want to be a doctor, he wanted to be a sports re -- the reporter, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">This is your life, you live it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">At 21 he moved out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we moved to the <span class="BUILDING">town house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Fine, you live your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I’m not going to make scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He 1s 40 years old, he is not married yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I would love to have a grandchild, but if he doesn’t want to get married yet, if he want to play the <span class="DLF">field</span> , fine, what do I care?</span></p>
