"</span><span class="sentence" id="122">But if she you, I tell you what, we are going both to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld, making an appointment, tell him what we experience with your sister-in-law, that we don't like it, that we are crazy, crazy about things, she doesn't know more" and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And we went to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Can you explain as to who Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld 1s, in that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld was a man who, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a law 175, yes the homosexuality law, number 175 and he had a big practice in the . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">That is like a little <span class="DLF">Central Park</span> , you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">A big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> and he had patients there, laying on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and here was his private <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and very often he made, how shall we say, balls on Saturday evening for the homosexual, with 150, 200 people there, dancing in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> there and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">High prices, but this money was good for him because for that he can experience, go <span class="NPIP">places</span> and look for, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But anyway, as I said before, we went to him and he came in and I never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Should I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Where we hang our hat and our coats, there are all pricks out a foot around the whole thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I screamed out laughing and the guy who was sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , "What are you laughing mister?" </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I said, "That's too funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">To put hangers like this in a..." " Well," he says, "this is our trademark, period." </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We were besides ourself that's. _</span><span class="sentence" id="136">So then he came in, he was a little, stout man, I expected something completely different, but he is very, how shall I say, imposing and I told him the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And he said, "Why do you send that woman to me and I will clear her mind and tell her what is what and why is why. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">This is not a sickness, this 1s what you are born with, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And there's no question about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I said my friend was very, how shall I say, backward, you know, he never... So I said, "Doctor, would you do me a big favor?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="141">Certainly, what 1s it?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="142">Send a letter to that woman and just tell her, or write to her what you told us nght now and I would be very, very happy and appreciate it no end." "</span><span class="sentence" id="143">No question about it, tomorrow the letter goes out." </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So the next Friday evening we came to Emil's(ph) parents for dinner and she came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">She didn't speak to him, she spoke right away to me, "What did you do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I said, "What did I do?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="147">Well," she says, "I got a letter." </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I said, "And does that clear up your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Does that make you feeling better?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="150">It's unbelievable what you did and why you did, giving my address and my name." </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I said, "Look, you bothered Emil so much and he was so depressed that I wanted to shut it out once and for all and that's why we went to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld and he sent you the letter and that should clear your mind, period." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So his mother said, "When Rolf told you what he just told you, isn't that enough for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Don't you have to go on?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="154">I have it my way and not his way." </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So we were, how shall I say, not very friendly all the time, you know, til we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  I have a question because you started to tell us that she proposed that you both go to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Was he very known in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Very well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
