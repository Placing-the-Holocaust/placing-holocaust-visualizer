<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  My name is Samuel Spiegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I was born in , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on August the 23rd, 1922. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I had three more sisters and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was the oldest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">We had a <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my mother passed away in childbirth and I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Then my father remarried a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We had a pretty normal living until the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I wouldn't say we were rich, but we were middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We lived pretty nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Then when the war broke out in 1939 it was September Ist a bomb fell into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">It was about 7:00 in the morning and we were lucky to get out about five minutes before, and nobody got hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But, this was only the beginning because the minute the Germans came in, things started to get very bad for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It was September when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> starts again, and Jewish kids were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But, the Jewish community opened up some little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> that the kids went to so they can learn a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">In 1940, the middle of 1940, the Germans gave an order that we have to give away all the jewelry and all the furs that all the people had, and we gave everything away, but we thought it's a war, maybe they need it and things are going to get a little bit better. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Things started getting worse and by the end of 1941 they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Actually, I just want to go back a little bit before you describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">A little more background, was your family religious and also before the war did you mingle with Polish kids or did you feel any anti semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Before the war, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , but there were very few Jewish kids in our class of 55 kids, there were about six Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They must sit on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the left side of the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Mostly it was a <span class="BUILDING">catholic school</span> and prayers were said every morning and every night before we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We just stood there, but the Jewish kids didn't have to say the prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We mixed with the friends that I had in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but socially we hadn't mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Sometimes when they needed some help, some <span class="BUILDING">school</span> help, they used to come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I used to help them out a little bit, but otherwise, they had different friends and we had different friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Because I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from early in the morning until about 2:00 in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">2:00 we used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and have our main meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Then I used to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> to learn religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I usually didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until about 6:00 in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Then, at night my father was very active and designed this movement in those days, so I used to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew School</span> which was called a Tabut, and that's usually how my schooling was, because when the war broke out, I was about 16 1/2 close to 17 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  So your family was religious and involved in Jewish activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Very involved, but I wouldn't say very religious, more like conservative.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  He was involved in political organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  A little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I don't remember exactly, but I know he was involved in organizations quite a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Did you ever experience any attacks or any --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their <span class="DLF">doors</span> because what they preached mostly in the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">When they come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Were you aware of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  No, we were aware very little of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  How large was your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had about close to 10,000 population. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Business and that was fairly integrated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Now, you told me when the Germans came into in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and bomb fell on your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  September the Ist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Yes, what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  We ran out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , then we had to get another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I think we moved in with our grandmother for a little while in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> just to stay until things straightened a little bit out. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a while, and I got sick in 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky they put me away in a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and nobody found out about it, and I survived somehow the typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Then I worked for the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because the Germans, when they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , made like the Judenaut which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> over there for them, until I sent away to , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Things got very bad in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There was a lot of sickness, a lot of poverty. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We didn't get enough food to eat to feed the people, but we helped each other as much as we could as a community. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Because we still lived in our own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and we had some little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I even had a paper that I could go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , because I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I worked in the labor department, in that <span class="REGION">section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I could see what started going on and I was very, very upset with all those things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too long, and I decided to get out and when I went to to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , this was before they took all the Jewish people out from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The fellow that took me out from there was an SS man by the name of . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He said we have to go to , because there's a big <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> and we'll have to send a lot of people over there to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We have to go over and see how things are set up over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">When I came over there, we went over there on a Thursday and he said Monday maybe we'll come back and he said Sam there's nothing to go back anymore because all the Jewish people from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">That's how I stayed over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">All the time I was in for about two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit more about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , what you all did? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Was it closed in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  It was closed in <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You couldn't go in, you couldn't get out unless you had a special paper from the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The SS used to come in every day to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , take people out to work, kill a lot of them while they were doing it, and we even had a little <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">A lot of people that got sick and had typhus, they took them out and they shoot them, they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Also, I remember when they came in one day and this was in 1942 in the beginning, and they said they need about 25 men and 25 women because they had to take them away to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> somewhere to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They took them into a <span class="BUILDING">public bath house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They gave them a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and they shaved their hair and everything else and they send them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We found out later that they took them away to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that they tried out the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">This was a try out. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We couldn't believe that those things are happening, but later on we found out that they were true. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There was gas put into the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Life was very difficult in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Nobody was working except when the Germans took you out to work somewhere on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but you still used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night and be with your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">That was one good thing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You always had hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">You figured it's a war, maybe the war is going to finish tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Maybe things are going to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We also felt that we have to stick together in order to keep each other alive and maybe things are going to change a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  What about activities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , cultural activities, religion, your father's political --
ANSWER:  All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out that you couldn't do, you couldn't do things, you know, you were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">You were afraid even to go out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> during the day because they would catch you all the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They used to come in every day to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and do what they want to, and a lot of people got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">If they didn't like somebody, they just killed them 1n the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It didn't make any difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Did you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Oh, sure, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used to call him. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He was a very, very cruel man. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He just came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I remember right near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We were sitting <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We were afraid even to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So those things were going on daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was a daily occurrence. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It wasn't new.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Did your father keep up any this organizing underground, the Zionism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It's true that they got together and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there was no help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> without help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , it was very hard to organize anything, especially in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Did you observe shobot, holidays, anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  We used to observe it in the way we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I remember my mother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I used to help a little bit because I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my portion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> instead of eating so I can help out the family a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Tell me a little about the Judenaut, how you got that job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the Judenaut, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how I got the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because usually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and all the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because I knew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means to get their food from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  What other privileges did you get from working there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , if I had to go out for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">If you get out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , because you m1x with the Gentile people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you could help yourself a little bit more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Were you able to help your family by virtue of your position other than the food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  No, not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which they worked at , and it was named , the firm. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But what happened, the day before they took all the Jews from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He was caught in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and he was taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Was your Judenaut appointed by the local community or by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Mostly by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They picked one man, and then he picked everybody that he wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Some people that he knew or were close friends of his.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  You hear stories about Judenauts and various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Some of them were very helpful to the community, some of them were trying to save their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">How do you kind of assess how your Judenaut operated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  We knew it was a very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">You have to understand what was going on in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">If they came in and saw the President of the Judenaut, I want 200 people tomorrow to work, you had to be the one to supply those 200 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So, you had a lot of people that didn't like you because, they said why take me? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Why not take somebody else? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You're put in the position that if you do right or you do wrong, you're not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I'm sure that you heard that ; which was the President, committed suicide because he knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Some people were a little bit stronger and they didn't commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They did what they had to do and they made a lot of enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">In my opinion they really helped a lot of people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But you don't remember the good things that people do, a lot of people you remember the bad things what a lot of people do. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I couldn't say that I think most of them didn't want to do what they did, but they had to do because they were forced to do, because if not, somebody else would do the thing, and they would lose their life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Now, you worked in the labor department?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The labor department, for instance, the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to work tomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from the register that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are going the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , you know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't really the one who went out and took the people out, who put them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  But how were those choices made, which 200?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  They usually were made according the list that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The way the President of the Judenaut decided or the people on top of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I was 17 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I didn't make the big decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They said, listen, those people we don't want to go, and those people we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who 1s a little better off or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help other people they should stay in <span class="NPIP">place</span> to help them, instead of sending them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I mentioned that there were certain people who were privileged. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">If he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">He picked them out to go to a job that was a little easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I imagine everybody did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">If I could help some of my friends, I helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">If I could help somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Were there women in the Judenaut?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  No, not too many that I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the Judenaut toward other people because of their special power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They used to dispense the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They used to get it, and then divide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The people used to have little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or twice a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We also had <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> that we set up in order to help the people that didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to cook or couldn't help themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Anything else about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> that you can think of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good job that was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , that the Germans took you away, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were going to take you to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They said we have here, we need some people to send out the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We're going to take you and you're going to be living over there and you're going to be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So, a lot of people even went by themselves because they figured they would be better off than being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and sickness going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that they're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  So, you were already in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over there in the building section. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was a very, very big <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We lived right in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was like a whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It was one of the largest <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">That's where I got to know my wife over there in 1942 because women and men were in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We lived in separate <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but we were in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was really watched by a Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were watching our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="193">It was pretty tough over there, but we had a little bit more to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We worked but we mixed with other nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">The Polish people worked in the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">At night time we used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and still see our friends and everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We tried to help each other as much as we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We found out after the war that the fellow that was in charge of our camp over there, he was a German by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> was a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in other camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He was caught after the war in the and he was telling the things that he was doing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I know when they took us away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and told them that , We were very good workers and we know the ammunition, that we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , and they should send us to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They did. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Very few of our people, except the older ones were taken away to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The rest of us we got numbers and we were sent away to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I wasn't in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> really too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I was over there maybe three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , by the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">conductor trains</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> , a lot of our people were dead, because we traveled -- I don't remember exactly if it took two days, or three days, or maybe four days, but we didn't have any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We didn't have any water. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They didn't give us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We didn't have any facilities even in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">When they opened up, a lot of people were dead, and because we were people that already came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , we didn't have any luggage with us, or any valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They chased us out from there and we went through the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and luckily it was showers and not gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We came out from there and they numbered us and they put us in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Then, people came in from <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> because the Germans, this was in 1944, a lot of the Germans went up on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> and they needed people to replace them at their <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , so they needed workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So they came in from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , this is from the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> and they said they need sheet metal men. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I didn't have a trade, but I had a friend by the name of Coopersmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He passed away, he survived and lived in <span class="REGION">California</span> and they said Sam, when they ask for sheet metal men, why don't you pick up your hand and tell them you're sheet metal man. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">You're very handy, you'll go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We'll see that you do something, but God's will they picked him and sent him to a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> and they sent me into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work in the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I came in over there, I didn't know the trade, I didn't know what to do, but then I tried to take the broom and keep the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> very clean, which it was a very big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was about 6,000 people working over there, but our <span class="REGION">section</span> had maybe 30 people working, 35, in the sheet metal section, and there were three Germans that were running it, so because I kept the <span class="NPIP">place</span> clean, so they figured everything is fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They took a liking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I learned a little bit of trade over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">By the end of 1944 I think it was in November, when the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the Russians started progressing more on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and the Germans used to have their <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> 1n <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and they bunked a lot of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , they brought a lot of our men to the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> to be fixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">The soldiers that were in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , came with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They usually waited until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were fixed, so they put on another shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Before they put on another shift, the SS man came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">His name was Fox. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He said, each one he assigned us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a pullman to go out and check on those pullman. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I went out to mine because I didn't know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I showed him where the damage was and what we're going to fix. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">When he came on and asked everybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the second shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I couldn't tell the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I took the bull by the horn. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I figured listen I had to take a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We went out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I never smoked. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They knew that I didn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I was put in charge, I was put in charge over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That's where I learned my trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">When I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that's the trade I went into, and I built up a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington DC</span> and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when I came over here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  I want to learn a little bit more detail about some of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Your interaction with the other people, with the guards, what your daily life was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> we didn't have any interaction with the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">You're very, very scared of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I'm going to tell you an incident which happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">sheet metal shop</span> , and I used to make things out of little pieces of copper that I used to find, other things, some rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I used to exchange them for little pieces of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I was called one day, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men took my number and usually every Sunday the persecutions were going on, because we didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Anybody did something that they didn't like, they used to hang them and then send them away to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  This 1s which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And I already knew what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I figured my gosh how can I get out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials that , which means they are materials they use during the war for war materials, because I used copper. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So, I made the decision that when the main commandment came out, we had appeals every morning that we stayed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I had to come because the Germans were very how do you say it -- they counted us almost all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I went out and I went down to the main man behind him and I told him that I was making something for him for Christmas and it was taken away from me in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I said I don't mind that they took it away from me, but I said I worked for it for almost two weeks in order to have it for you as a present and I would like you to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It went away, I never heard any thing more about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They never called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The commander got to know me very well because we went out through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> a lot of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">He used to knock me on the shoulders when we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">That's how I survived from going to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We had to think sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was liquidated, my whole family went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , and they all perished in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That's what I found out at , a couple weeks later after I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So, I was the only one from the whole family left, from the immediate family, but I had some friends that they brought in from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to , too, and they worked over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So, we used to meet every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I think in there must have been about 2,000 or a little bit over 2,000 people over there working. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Things were tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We didn't have enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">There was sicknesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I had two friends by the name, one of them, that he was sick one of them was and the other one was , and they took them all out one day and they shot them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They liquidated the whole <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They took everything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So, you can imagine how we felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Things were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I had to get in to tell other monstrosities that were going on over there, but that's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They took them all out and shot them at one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Plus the other things that were going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We got beatings every day, coming in or going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">The food was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But, like I told you, we tried to help each other in order to keep our things a little bit up. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it was altogether different. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">It was hard to believe what was going on over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We could see the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We could smell the smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We knew the people that were taken over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We were ones of the lucky ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The minute we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they started chasing us and they gave us the numbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and then they put us through a solution that we walked through. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We didn't even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We were just like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You were chased and you didn't know what was going on to you at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Then they put us in <span class="DLF">line</span> and they came out and the doctors mingle and the other ones were in white coats, and they look through and one of them goes to this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and one of them goes to this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and one to this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and one to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Now, I was lucky that it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , not really <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">This was part -- they called it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz II</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Then them came to make the selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">When they made the selections and I was sent away in those first three days, that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I don't even remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It's very hard for me to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We didn't do any work. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We were sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was cold, it was wet and they wouldn't even let us get into <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> until they came at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Then we used to sleep with 15 people on one , with a little bit of snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I was glad to get out from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">When they brought us into , which was part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it was the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that we went to, over there, because we worked with different nationalities and we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with a lot of Germans, everybody had a different . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We had a straw sack with a little blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">That's all we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We slept with about 200 people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But they kept us a little bit cleaner. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We had the laundry and the clothes that we were wearing the striped clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We had to change because in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> it was grease working around <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We had to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and used to change the clothes and they gave us other clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But, we had selections every Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They looked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good, they took them out and they send them away to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They brought in other people to replace them. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The food we got in the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and we stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They called it Appeal, that they counted us, every morning, and if somebody was missing, we had to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Because sometimes somebody died during the night and never even came out, or something happened, but we had to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And if they didn't count us, we didn't couldn't go to work until everything was counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Then we had about five miles, maybe four miles that we would have to walk from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The music was playing near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> where we went out, and the music was playing at night when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">The bread was made out, you could feel the straw inside that you could hardly eat it, but we had to eat it because you had to survive on something. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We got a little bit, 1t was like tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They said it was a special tea that was made that we drank a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Then in the middle of the day you got a little bit of soup which was mostly water. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Then at night, when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , either we got another little piece of soup or we got another little piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">This was our food for a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Things were very, very bad, because a lot of people, we didn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">The minute you got sick a little bit, you were taken out, and we alot of times when we went out to work and maybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and by the time we got back, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> behind us that they killed off the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We just loaded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> the ones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we walked from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The ones that couldn't keep up with it, they killed them on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and they put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and then they took them away to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But we couldn't help ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We couldn't even escape because on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> there was nobody to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I had a friend that escaped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when they took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and got into the woods, and when he came back, he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">His name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He came back, he said listen don't go on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> because they burn you over there and we thought that the man was crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We didn't believe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We said how can they tell living people and burn them especially you know in our days? </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And another thing that we couldn't understand it's as 1f the world would know that those things would go on, we are taught that somebody <span class="NPIP">outside</span> must know because if they would know what was going on in here, they couldn't sit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and not do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But, we never got any help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">When he was on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , he said he couldn't stay over there because they wanted to kill him because , SO he tried to get back and came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">This was in before they took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">That man didn't live through. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because he was already on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> one time, from , from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">He jumped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and he was shot before he got -- no, before we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , he ran away, and he was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">But, when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we realized what the man told us was true, but we couldn't help ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="351"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we had a lot of hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We could see that this thing couldn't last on forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But, it was very easy to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">All you had to do was through yourself on the wires, because the wires were electric. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They had 600 volts in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And a lot of people did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But, if we found out that somebody was very despondent and we felt that he was going to do something, we tried to talk to him and tell him listen, the outside world cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on here and not do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It looks like the war is already coming to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We knew little things what were going on because we didn't have any radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We didn't have any papers, and nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> were afraid to talk to us, because if they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They took them away, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, we tried to help each other as much as we could in order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And thank God some of us survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">When they took us out on the Death March --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet so we need to set that up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">One day, when we were , they came in and they said that they have to take us all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They didn't take us where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We found out later that this was the death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We were only about 60 kilometers away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all the people that were going met the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So, they took us out one morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">It was snowing in January, January the 22nd. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">It was snowing and it was very cold <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We didn't have any clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We didn't have anything with us, and we marched because they didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to put us on, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were shot on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">One night it was in January, I think it was the 25th of January, they brought us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in , which was a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They brought us in all over there because the SS that were going with us, they had to rest a little bit too. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So, we stayed over and in the middle of the night they started shelling the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They woke us up about 12:00, 1:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">There might have been about 60,000 of us over there because they brought them from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They chased us out and I had a dream that night when I was sleeping, my mother came to me and said Sam, don't leave this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I had an argument with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I told her listen, how can I not leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You know we're almost liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">You see what's going on, but when they started chasing us, I forgot the dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">When I was near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to go out, I had two friends with me, one was from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Weinberg was his name, and the other one was from . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">When we came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , my dream came back to me and I figured, no I'm not going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I'm not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So, the other one from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , he didn't want to go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He said, Sam we're almost liberated I'm going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I'm going where they chasing us to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I said no, but the other one, I took care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">He was a little bit younger and I took care of him a lot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So, I smacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the other side and there was a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It was a <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> over there about three foot thick, and there was a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in it that was made from one of the shells or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I crawled out and there was a <span class="DLF">ravine</span> and I rolled down into the snow with them and we ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we stayed over there for about eight days until the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The Russians liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">If you asked me how I survived in those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for eight days in that cold weather and everything else, I can hardly remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I know we had frozen toes and at night time we used to go out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">In Europe they used to have to put away potatoes in the winter time <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they used to cover them with sawdust and then have a <span class="DLF">door</span> on the southside that they used to take the potatoes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The sun used to come out during the day, so we stole some of those potatoes and we ate those raw potatoes and we had snow as water. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">That's how we lived through until we survived from those eight days. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">If you ask me to tell you anything about those things, I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But there were some other people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> too, when I was over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I met a friend of mine, from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that escaped too, at the same time, by the name of David Bay, and he lives now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , and we're still very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We used to crawl one into the other one in order to keep us warm during the night until we got up the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Then we used to run a little bit, you know, in order just to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Then from that time after, I walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It took me almost about two weeks to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because there was no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We could catch any transportation we could, and when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , -- so I was one of the ones who was liberated early. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Even when I came back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> --the reason I went back was because I thought maybe somebody from my family was alive still. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I couldn't believe that everybody was gone that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">There was no work, and no way to make a living, and I told you before that one of my father's friend's daughter was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">She was on the <span class="REGION">Gentile side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">She was not in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">She was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I even got together with her I told her I said Tasha, we are only about seven Jewish people in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that came back in those days when I was over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Some of them even came from the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> already or there were Gentile papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I said we have to do something 1n order to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I said I'm going to put that <span class="BUILDING">flour mill</span> back in operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I got the Gentile fellow, the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , and we put it back in operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We started -- the farmers used to bring in their corn, and we used to keep 50 percent for the making the flour and they used to keep the other 50 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">That's how me made a living in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We have a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">We remodeled a little bit and we moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I didn't know that Regina was alive still --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  We need to stop here a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">First of all, I want you to tell me what it was like when you went back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> after you were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I mean you didn't go there and five minutes later you were a business man. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="431">What did you find?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  When I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the first thing, we left a lot of things with a lot of people, with our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I couldn't get anything back, and I was afraid to get back because I figure when asking to give back they might do something to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So, all the Jewish people that came back, we moved into one of our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that my uncle used to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And we stayed over there all together, and one of my cousin's survived too. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">She lives now in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So, we all lived over there for quite a while, maybe for a couple, two or three months, but we had to go and get something to eat, because nobody gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">We used to go to the government, but they themselves didn't have too much, but at least we had a little piece of bread to eat because we didn't need the things like you know like we live over here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">If we had a piece of bread and a couple potatoes, this was enough for us to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But we Started to build up ourselves a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But, I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I had the infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a little while, but when I came out and I got together with my father's friend's daughter, we decided that we had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I didn't want to put it up as a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I wanted to put it up so that we can make a living and the farmers needed us too. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">The farmers were after us to put the <span class="BUILDING">flour mill</span> back in operation because that was the only <span class="BUILDING">flour mill</span> around, maybe 50 miles around our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">The only one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  How did your Polish neighbors treat you? </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Did they welcome you back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I hate to say it, but even with the friends that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and everything else, I lived over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I was born over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">My family lived over there for generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I don't know how many generations, but the first question when they saw me "You're still alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But, things are different now. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I always tell them that I wish you would ask me if I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">From the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , from the 4,500 that we lived in, I think maybe close to a 100 are alive and not all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">A lot of them ran away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and they came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We still get together even during the summer, we have sometimes a gathering from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we get together, all of them together, to see how everything goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  So, they weren't very kind to you when you got back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  No, not too kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And we had --I had to escape from there, because they started pogroms again. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The pogroms started in and the day Regina came back she went to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and she went up to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> to find out if some of her family may have come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">There was a fellow behind that said Regina run away because they just killed . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">was a fellow that came back too from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and they just killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So, she went down from that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and she didn't have time to get into her <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , then she came back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  Now, we haven't even discussed Regina, so people watching the tape won't know who Regina is. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You need to back track a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  In the beginning, I think I said that I met Regina in in 1942, and then when they took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> before they took us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> we could see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We made up that if we live through we're going to meet in , my little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and get together over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">She was liberated in May, and when she came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , was sometime June, but it's miraculous that she was liberated on the third day, she already knew that I was alive, because things were going on, the communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">She knew, she met some people that says I already heard that Sam is alive and I was glad to hear too, and I was waiting for her to come back because I was the only one left from the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">She was the only one left from the hole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  I was wondering when you were talking about your fiance coming to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , did you think you'd see her again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  I was hoping that I would because I knew I lost everybody else, but I was very happy to hear that she was still alive because I found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">News traveled, and maybe I should get back for someplace for her to come to, but we couldn't get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">What happens in the Jewish religion to get married you need ten people to have a witness to have a . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There weren't ten Jews even there to get married, but we got together the ones that were over there and we told them, that because she doesn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to live and I don't, we're going to move in together and we're going to get married the minute we can get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  So, describe to me when she came, when you saw her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Oh, it's very I was one of the happiest people because I figured she was the closest one to me, because I was with her for almost two years in together, and in she lived in a different <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and I lived in a different <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and one time I went over to visit her and one Ukrainian took me out from a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I got 25 lashes and I'll never forget it, but it was worth it to see her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  You went to her <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  You went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">You could go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We didn't live together in the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but we lived in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you could go and visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But if the Ukrainian, if he wasn't a very nice fellow, he took you out and most of them were not nice and they just gave me a beating one of those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He said it's too late, you should already be in your <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> not over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Because I didn't have time to go when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So, we knew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that we couldn't stay over there no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We'll have to leave this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">There's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for Jews to live any more after what happened over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So, one day, when I found out what was going on and I had a threat that they're trying to kill me so I went to the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I found out that he was one of the teachers that I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my last years. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">His name was Peshko. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">He was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I went over to him and I told him Mr. Peshko, I have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I lived through Hitler and I don't need this and I have to get a paper from you to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and you couldn't just go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> any time you wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So, he said, Sam I'm going to give you a paper because we're trying to have a out on and maybe you can get over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But when I got the paper I was afraid to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because people knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So, Regina and I packed, just two sets of underwear in a little suitcase and I went out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to and took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">At that night we ended up on the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovakian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They went through and they checked your passports on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We went out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We crawled under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on both sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Went out to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czechoslovakian train</span> and so when the Asians went out from their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> we went upstairs and wind up in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">When we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> we came to I think and then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We got off the -- we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and Regina thought that I had the little suitcase and I thought she had the little suitcase and we left it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the main it was a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> over there, a <span class="BUILDING">street car station</span> , and I asked Regina do you have the suitcase? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">No, do you have it? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So, I asked the fellow, we spoke a little bit Czechoslovakian because it's the same language a little bit similar to Polish, he said you wait here. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It takes about three quarters of an hour for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> to come back and I'm sure the little suitcase is going to be on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We waited over there for three quarters and we had a little suitcase and we got it back, so we're lucky to get the two sets of underwear because we didn't have anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But then they had the Jewish community over there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We stayed over there, we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> for maybe a month, and then I decided we can't stay here either and I went back with Regina to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> in which was established at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We were one of almost the first ones over there and I worked in that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I worked for the United Nations Relief Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And the Joint Distribution made our wedding over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We got married over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The wedding was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Then Regina got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Something was wrong and they took her to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they gave her some medicine which didn't agree with her and she developed some kind of a blood -- something was wrong with her blood and a fellow came in from the C.I.A, and American, by the name of Doctor Aaron Mayer, asked what can I do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">She said I don't need anything, the only thing she says I know I have an uncle in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but I don't know where he lives but I know his name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So, what he did, Doctor Aaron Mayer, he put an ad in the Jewish papers but the uncle didn't read the Jewish newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He read the New York Times. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">A lady from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington D.C.</span> by the name o Mrs. Freedman, used to work with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Her mother used to have a <span class="BUILDING">dress shop</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and she read the and she knew him from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she called him up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and told him that the niece of his is alive and was looking for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The first thing we got from him was papers to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and they were signed by J.

ANSWER:  We got those papers from her uncle, and it took us almost a year before we could come over here, even with the papers being in order and everything else, but we moved from to because we found out one of the brothers was alive and he was in the American Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">He escaped during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">He went to <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="540">Then he joined the American Army and became a citizen and that's how he came back to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Then when we found out he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regina</span> says we might as well move to SO we can be closer to her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">We stayed over there until we came over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Let me tell you something about . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">When we came to , we were one of the first ones to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">There were a lot of other nationalities over there, but they all had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They had relatives, but the Jews didn't have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go back especially in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">There <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">No family left, and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them to go back and live. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Even at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , the ones that came back and started, they found out there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">They had to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They have to go back and it was a lucky thing that we have to thank President Eisenhower for opening up the <span class="DLF">borders</span> and letting the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> come back in to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Also, a lot of the people that were in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> somewhere else that they escaped didn't have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and they came to the D.P. camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">We stayed over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">In the beginning the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We were closed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They had soldiers <span class="NPIP">outside</span> watching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We couldn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We didn't have freedom to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So, finally, President Eisenhower gave an order to take the guards off that we can go free around and move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> that we want to so we could walk a little bit more out and everybody started to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Most of us wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in those days, but <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was not a state and they couldn't take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So, they had the ax of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that they got, they took some of them in, but the rest of them we had to stay over there, especially if you were married and you already have somebody those were the worst ones that they wanted to take out in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They took out only the small children that were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They figured that's the most important to get them out from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">The food in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was not too bad, but they gave us rations but you know they said we'll give you 1,300 calories but it depends what kind of food they give us, the calories. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It wasn't food that the people were used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So, President Eisenhower changed those things too. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Then we started helping ourselves a little bit, and started working a little bit and people started to find out where there families are so they can leave because none of us wanted to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span> , but we didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> wouldn't let us in in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="569"><span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> wouldn't let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="570"><span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> wouldn't let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the Polish Jewish couldn't go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I was over there already back one time and I had to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So, we had problems for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">It's hard to understand what was going on over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">With all those things, unless you're over there yourself you witness it, because it's impossible to tell what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or even the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> or even the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We still didn't have enough freedom in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span> until the end because we were still controlled by the Americans what we can do and what we cannot do. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">President Eisenhower was a big help, and he really did a lot for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span> , quite a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Was it your sense that was well organized and well run and that people's needs were basically taken care of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  Not in the beginning when I got in over the first time, but later on it improved, because I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I worked for the and I was taking care of the registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">People that came in over there and then the was getting some food out already for the people and they found out exactly what they need and what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">At least we had enough to fill our stomachs. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We didn't have to wait until -- you still had to have cards to go and get your food, like coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But we already had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They set up a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">If there were any children that came in, they could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we organized our own <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and clubs so we can come together and we can talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">If a family was left, they found out if you were in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they could transfer from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> so they can be with the family together. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">It was a big improvement. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We were free at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We knew what was freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I'm going to tell you about the food incident so you'll know what the difference was when we finally got our papers to go to and come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">When we came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the first thing we asked the fellows, the Americans, says when we get our coupons to get food, because we always used all those years to get coupons to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">He says, don't worry, you're going to get enough to eat, but we couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I remember the first dinner we had when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We were all sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , and we saw all the bread and all the stuff on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , everybody filled their packets up because we couldn't believe that there's so much, that there's food enough, that you can eat as much as your heart desires. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">We had even a couple, an elder couple that passed away on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> because they ate too much of the food that they shouldn't have eaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Even I remember myself after the first meal I couldn't eat for maybe three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I got sick, because we couldn't understand that there's so much food and here we were going around hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Even the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span> , we had enough food but we didn't have the food just satisfy yourself what you wanted to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You eat what they give you. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They gave you some soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">You had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">You didn't cook yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">You didn't have any facilities to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But things were much better in the D.P. camps than in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- I'm not talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It's hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I remember when I lived through and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told some people what I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">At first I couldn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">It took a long time until I could tell anybody what I went through, but the people couldn't believe this. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They couldn't believe that something like this happened, which I and Regina were just invited to the <span class="BUILDING">British Embassy</span> to watch a film and also to the <span class="BUILDING">Canadian Embassy</span> to watch a film about the survivors, the American and the Canadian, that were shot down over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">A lot of them instead of putting them in P.O.W. camps, they put them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There were a couple of survivors, one American, one Canadian and one British and I talked to them and they told me they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they told their parents what they went through in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and their parents told them you're just telling stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">That 1s impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">This could not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Finally now, they tape them in order to have their stories what they went through and lot of them are already very old. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">One of them told me that Walsh was his name he said his father couldn't even come because he had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He wanted to come to the gathering that they had about the film, but he couldn't come to it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So, his son was over there representing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Those other things that happened, not only the Jews, even the other nationals, the Gentile people that were over there, the Americans and the English, even when they told their stories nobody would believe them when they told them what was going on in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  In the beginning when you were in and people from a lot of other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , did you mix with them or did the Jews kind of stick with themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  A lot of Ukrainians over there and we didn't feel very comfortable with them because they were in charge with our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and they all had to leave in order for us to get over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We couldn't stay with them together. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Because people don't realize but they were our enemies not our friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">They used to say they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but we know what kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> they went into.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  So, how did all of that work out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  It worked that they had to ship them somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go back to but they didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">They were afraid to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they were collaborators with the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  But initially at , they put you all together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  What else can you tell me about . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Did people work there? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Did you live in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Did you live in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  In we had little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> like semi detached <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and usually you lived so many people in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">In one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , for instance we had a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and most of our relatives from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> lived with us in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but we already had for instance we had separate <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Two people slept in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , or three people slept in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , because when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , we were a family of I had three sisters, a brother, myself and my parents, we all had only one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> wasn't too big. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I don't know if the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was ten feet by fifteen feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">We all slept in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Some people had it even worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was more crowded even. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We already, we figured we're lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The whole family stays together in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Some of them they put different families together because it was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They didn't have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">The Germans didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">They brought them in, you find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them where to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Did people work at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I know you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">ANSWER:  Yes, a lot of them worked too. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">They worked for the Joint Distribution Committee but as far as other jobs like working in trades or something, but the came in and the put up some <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to teach the people trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">That was a very, very big help because a lot of them don't like -- fix <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span> and other stuff and they came over here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and somewhere else and that's the business that they went into. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">That's what they started doing here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  What about religion? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Did that start coming back to people? </span><span class="sentence" id="658">To you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  To me it took a long time to come back, but to a lot of people that were very religious and they had religion going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">They didn't have those big <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> like they have here, but they had little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that they got together, but they celebrated either Passover or Rosh Hoshana, Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We celebrated those holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">There were some that didn't want to celebrate and you had some that were very religious and some were not so religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  What about you and religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  Myself? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">When I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I saw what was left from the whole family, for a while I thought why be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">If God could have been around to watch over us the things that were going on and not say anything, maybe there's nobody around here. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Finally you know I'll get away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I don't look so Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I was born here. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I'll get away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There's not too many Jews, but after the pogroms started again, I figured I cannot do those things, because if I'm going to marry somebody and my kids are grown up, they might do the same thing what the people are doing right now here. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">My religion is still better. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I don't have to be very, very religious but it's still better than any other religion that sided against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  What do you think sustained you through all of these years? </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Why do you think you got through it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  Not that I was smarter than anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">A lot had to do with luck where you were, and what you were doing at a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">A lot of times, even now, I think why me why nobody else from my family except me. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I can't answer that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">What kept us together was because we were young, very, very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The older people that had more experiences and more knowledge about life, a lot of them committed suicide or they couldn't put up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But we young ones, we kept each other going. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Life was just starting for us, and we figured that this has to come to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We knew that a war does not go on forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And we also promised each other that somebody has to stay alive to tell what was going on in that <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , what was really going on 1n those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and every where else. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Who else is going to tell them, because now the youngest one already is my age and in another short time, there's very few of us going to be left, especially witnesses that were over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">It's going to be history and history doesn't change around. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They already deny it. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">You have a lot of revisionists that say that the Holocaust did not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So, we feel, because we never talked about those things, but we feel that now that we have to talk about them in order to make people and especially the kids that those are the things that really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">For instance last year I and Regina went with a group of kids, Jewish kids from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We went on the March of . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We took them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It's amazing what that did to the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">At least they know they talked to some of them that were really there and showed them the <span class="NPIP">places</span> and what was going on in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Because just talking to somebody about it, it doesn't bring out as much as you can really go to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and witness and see what has been going on over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">A lot of those kids, that knew very little about Judaism have changed quite a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Over the last 50 years, I'm sure there are certain images that come back to you a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Can you talk about any of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  Those images come back to me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">There's plenty of nights that I talk to people about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I usually don't talk about those things during the day, and I told I have to be busy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the middle of the night still seeing all those monstrosities and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I can see them and I feel them. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I wake up 1n a sweat and it's very hard for me to get back to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">If we get together with our friends that went through, that's all we talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We can't talk about anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Thank God we have three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">We have seven grandchildren and I ask my kids, I said when you were younger when they were very little and they saw my number when they were two years, two and half, they asked me what is that number I used to tell them some bad people did it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But later on they never asked us any questions because they realized they heard us talk to our friends all the time, and they knew that something very bad happened to us during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Even now, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We knew what you went through but we didn't want to ask you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Even now, after 50 years, it's very, very hard to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">But then we figured we have to establish a new life when we came over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I worked seven days a week, 20 hours, as many hours as it took in order to build up what I did, and thank God it's a wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I wouldn't like to live anywhere else, and I appreciate everything that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And I'm paying taxes every year too, and I don't mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They've been very good to me here and since I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I've worked mostly for the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I did a lot of work -- I have clearance with the F.B.I., with the C.I.A., and I never forget when I came over to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I worked at and I worked at the and in the middle of the day, one of the soldiers came over and took me up to and I got very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I thought I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They were going to send me away somewhere else, and I found out the reason I was taken off of the job was because I didn't have my citizenship papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I was not a citizen and it was a job in those days was very secret and that I can't work over there because I wasn't a citizen, but the minute I got my citizen papers, I established back my credentials and I did not have a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Work mostly on the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I even did the in the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> when Nixon was making the tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">We worked around the clock for 24 hours in order to get the air conditioning and ventilation in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I'm thankful for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I have a very nice family and I hope that we stay well that I can do more what I want to do to help other people which is very, very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to add about those years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  I don't want to go through the monstrosities to tell you what's going on too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I get very, you know, I'm but if you have any special questions you want to ask me that you want me to say about I'll be glad to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  You have to appreciate that someone, sometime might look at this tape and say monstrosities, maybe they're going to want to know more what that means?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They are some good people with the bad ones too. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Even there were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and I worked with a German that was running the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler too much either, but he always every day, he knew what was going on, brought something in, like an apple sometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it until I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in trouble, and he put it away at a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and then I left, before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know, back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I used to share it with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">The fellow when were in the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was a German by the name of Walter, and I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and then they put him in charge of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I also found out later that it was a homosexual which I didn't even know what a homosexual really was when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in those days, but he also had a girlfriend in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and he spoke German and she spoke only Polish and when he found out he took me to carry the letters from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from him to her because he couldn't go out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">We went to work, but he stayed over the whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night he had this special soup for me which I shared with my friends and this means almost difference between life and death, this soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And also, in the winter time it was very cold over there, but because we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> an the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were running on coal, SO we made up that each man that came back took a little piece of coal and put it in his pocket, very little piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and half, and when we came back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bellie stove</span> , a little iron stove and the fellow that was running, that Walter, the German that was running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> didn't mind and everybody threw the little piece of coal in that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and we had it a little bit warmer at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">We were one of the lucky ones maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">You had to help yourself a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">You couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a little piece, nobody noticed when you went through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and coming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us instead of being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> you couldn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">The people that maybe survived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs, to take the clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they sorted the clothes, then they took the people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">If you were picked to do a job you couldn't help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">You took the people from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and put them 1n the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and it was people like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You know, they picked them out and that's what you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So, they use you as long as you could do it and if you got tired of doing it, they put you in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and picked somebody else to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So, it wasn't something like just -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I was in they used to hang people every Sunday and everybody that did something bad, they used to hang them on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">They used to pick up people from the rolls after they stayed on that appeal in the morning and we used to hang them. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">They didn't do it themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Used to go out and put the thing on their neck, but you couldn't help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be picked I would have to do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It was one of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Another thing in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> Sunday when we didn't go to work even if it was cold, we had to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="DLF">hole</span> day. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">They wouldn't let us go into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and sit <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because we were going to make it dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> are going to be dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">We had to make our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> as much as we could every morning and then you were sick you were afraid to go to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> because you knew what was going to happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here, right here, and I was afraid to go, and I don't know what I did but I put a piece of rope on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and it just healed up and I used to go to work, and I used to be sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I used to get a sore throat and a fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I used to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I never stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I figured if I stay I know what's going to happen to me, so this way I just went through and when we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , walking, we used to hold tight, used to hold each other in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my friends were dragging me in until we got in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I used to take my friends until we got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and that's how I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">We helped each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">If not we wouldn't be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Even when I escaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> it was so bad, but we survived somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It's amazing what a human being can stand when it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to escape because there was no body that helped a Jew on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Maybe in another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Maybe in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> but not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because most of the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> were built in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Even from the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , they brought them into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidonek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidonek</span> , is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp that</span> still the Germans didn't have time to destroy it and it's still, they can start up a ration over there in two days if they had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">The <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and everything is over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">That's why I took the march of the living kids who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidonek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">It's not only the Jews that got killed during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">A lot of the Russian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">When I was in there was a camp of Russian prisoners that they brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">There was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American prison camp</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They put them on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around it, didn't feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">They used to eat the grass from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">They never put them to work, and they all died out, then they took them to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So with us with the Jews, he just wanted to get rid of all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">You know in a war that you're going to have people that are going to get killed, but the Jews were all together different. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">He just wanted to get rid of all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Take a whole nation and get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">From what I understand in a lot of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I have an American that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I worked with him after the war and he remembered me always used to have a lot of talks with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">He used to come over to me and tell me what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">He said, Sam, there are a lot of people that may not believe you, but I know what you went through, because he was there himself.</span></p>
