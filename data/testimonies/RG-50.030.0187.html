<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you please tell me your full name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Frank Reiss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born April 21st, 1935, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Do you have any recollections of any of the events that happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in 1937 for <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We ran to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Can you tell us whether <span class="NPIP">places</span> in those events before you can remember anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">What happened to you and your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well, they were supposed to...we wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and we registered, but the quota was so over-subscribed and in the meantime we had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so we left for <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And after the Anschluss, after 1938, my father had a sister in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> where he was born and it was <span class="COUNTRY">Austria-Hungary</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So we left for <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , the Slovak part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And in the meantime my father was trying to arrange that we could leave for the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And of course he did not succeed and in the meantime, 1942 came and he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Before that happened take us up to that point, what happened to your father and mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  I already...once we reached <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , somewhere around 1940, my mother was already not in the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  What happened to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I found out after the war that she was involved in a...in an underground group that was smuggling people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to the West to safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I found out about it in a very strange way. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">There is a psychiatrist in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a Doctor Pearl who was involved in the Nuremberg trials as an American psychiatrist, and he is married to a lady who knew my mother from those times, who knew about her underground activities and knew about the whole group that they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And then I found out from practically the only surviving relative of mine, an Aunt, a sister of my mother, that my mother was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and was executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But I don't have any other details and I don't have any documents about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Then you and your father...where did you and your father go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  My father we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My father, I understand, was quite desperate because, of course, he couldn't find any work and he was practically just waiting for the opportunity still to get out and one day in March or April 1942, he got an invitation to report to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , that he will be taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So the night before that happened, he wrote a note which I have...was given to me after the war, where he authorizes my aunt to hand me over to a Jewish family in that small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> that was supposed to be protected from deportation because they had what was called either the yellow or the white exemption which could have been bought from the Slovak government. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">This yellow/white exemption indication that the person is important for the Slovak economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">This was already ,<span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> did not exist anymore, the Slovak 01:05: State, a puppet state put together by Hitler, and Hitler installed the Slovak fascist government. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The head of it was Monsieur Tiso. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">This was already the Slovak State. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So when they took my father I still stayed with my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">A few weeks later, they came to take my aunt and her husband and the maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They had a maid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Was Agnes. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Agnes Rebunska. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And she woke me up and I remember this...this actually [1s] one of the first recollections that I have about this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She just sent me out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And she pointed the direction to me, the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where her parents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I basically knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because she would take me there over the weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So I ran to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">On the <span class="DLF">road</span> somebody picked me up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , brought me to her parents, and from there on based on that authorization that my father wrote just before he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> I was given to this family who had these exemptions, the yellow/white exemptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  When Agnes Acnes got you out of there, and this is one of your first recollections, remember how you...what you saw that would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Did you have any feelings about it at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Feelings I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I remember thoughts that it seemed to me too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> seemed to me too far, and that I was very relieved when one of the young men from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who was on his way either to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or to a job in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> took me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , turned around, brought me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and handed me over to the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I recall much better when I was then brought to this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The name was Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They knew my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And when I arrived there they had a 19 year old son and they asked me to feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">This will be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Incidentally, from this family's balcony I was watching when my father left for the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to report to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They told him that he will go to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaki</span> , which was just...I don't know, maybe 25 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I also recall that people were telling him, "Mr. Reiss, don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">You are going to be taken somewhere else, not to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And he just dismissed this and I remember standing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and waving to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was the last time I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And after that I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I was a first grader in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> which was just around the corner from this <span class="BUILDING">family's house</span> so that my last recollection of seeing my father...
QUESTION:  You had no notion that that was the last time you would see your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Neither did my father, because my father wrote a card which I have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I have it framed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , smuggled it out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and the card says in German, "We are full of optimism, and we are looking forward to all that's to come and we will stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And there and then he sends regards to several friends so he did not know, and of course, I had no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  And you're with the Pollack family. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Can you tell us what happened them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  The Pollack family. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And 6 weeks, maybe 6 weeks later, with this yellow exemption or white exemption disregarded, we went to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zilina</span> , which is about, 100 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> and also in <span class="REGION">northern Slovakia</span> , but it's also very close to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is a very short distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I don't know...maybe a hundred miles maybe, a little bit more, but certainly not much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">There I already recall that we were very cramped in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I was 7 and I was looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> being filled with people and I remember I always enjoyed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was always something I was looking forward to...incidentally to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I was just waiting...'when will our turn come,' so I did not view it as something negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I wanted to take a train ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I got different feelings when I saw that they closed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was just standing there and some people were screaming for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And also what frightened me, there wasn't...there wasn't one German. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">This was all administered by the Slovaks, by the so called Hlinka guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Was the fascist uniformed members of the Hlinka party. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And one day I was wondering through this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There were wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and one of these Hlinka guards...I don't know whether they took pity on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I don't know what I looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But he invited me into a large <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and there were all these knapsacks and there was food, canned food. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And there were lemons I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And he said, "Take what you want.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I was...I believed quite a street smart kid, so I put some string around my pants and I stuffed the pants with all kinds of foods, cans, sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I brought it to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where we were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I remember a great feeling of satisfaction because I distributed food. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There wasn't starvation really there. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We were fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I believe twice a day we were getting some soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And this was basically just a transit camp, a camp where people arrived, loaded in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and sent on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  How did you get out of there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Well, this man...this Pollack was a dentist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He had a brother named Arthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Arthur was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> which is the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and he was by profession a printer and he had a very influential friend and professional colleague from the printing business whose name was Shajno Mach (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He was a minister of interior in the fascist government of Monsignor Tiso in charge of solving the Jewish question of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And Shajno Mach and Arthur Pollack were friends, drinking friends, card playing friends, fellow printers. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And Arthur was sort of a bon vivant as a I always understood, a womanizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">All kinds of vices, but he was also very close friend of Shajno Mach. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So Arthur, as I understand, went to <span class="BUILDING">Shajno Mach</span> and he arranged that we were released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I remember that one day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> showed up and we were let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And the magic word was a phonogram. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I did not know what a phonogram was, but I can still visualize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was a white piece of paper with something written on it, and it had a red stripe across. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And this was the paper that gave the orders to let us go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Did you have any idea that you are being rescued from death by that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Quite the con...I think I was...I was... I must have had mixed feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I don't know exactly, but I know that part of the feeling was there will be no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So that was the negative feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But I already saw some misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I remember and I can still visualize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There was a man laying on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">There were many people around him. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And it bothered me terribly because this man was not O1:15: supposed to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He was ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He was supposed to be in some kind of a therapeutic environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I couldn't verbalize it at that time in this way, but I just remember that this was disturbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The other disturbing thing was that we had extremely small <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and we were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we were sleeping on straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And this was again something that doesn't happen to you when you are in comfortable times. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So it must have been a mixed bag but that I am not going to take a train ride that bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So we got out of there and we knew that we have to go into a semi-hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> (ph) which is in <span class="REGION">eastern Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And there we rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Pollack could no longer practice as a independent dentist, but he took employment with a Jewish dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And we stayed in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> til 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And then some how things became bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Was either end of 1943 or even the beginning of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">and Pollack decided that we have to go into hiding again. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Not complete hiding, but just out of <span class="NPIP">site</span> into some <span class="NPIP">location</span> where we will be safer than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> which is a quite Slovak conditions, quite a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Let's say it had 20,000 inhabitants. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he made a very unfortunate decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He decided together with two extended families, maybe some 35 people, that all of us are going to go back to <span class="REGION">Western Slovakia</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="141">near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Hadn't some of you become nominally Lutherans at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  We came Lutherans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> we...we attended <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We got papers that we were Lutherans. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I still have the baptismal certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And it was a serious situation, yet it was a funny situation too because Pollack was brought up in a Yeshiva and was brought up as an Orthodox Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And to see this man forcing me and his wife to go to a Lutheran service was quite a funny sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And on top of everything, he would also use every opportunity and go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I don't think it was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was a Stiebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It was a <span class="BUILDING">prayer hall</span> , but nevertheless came, so the same man who on a Sunday would piously sit in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with us, on a Friday night on a Shabat or on a holiday would put on his talith and pray in a stiebel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Were you aware of the incongruity of that at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I was 8 and I remember I had a friend there whose name was Thury, who I will tell you a very sad story about Thury. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">His name was Arthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">His nickname was Thury. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I remember we were somehow discussing it and had a good time discussing the funny aspect of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Because his family had nothing to do with the Lutherans. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We were 01:19: the ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I don't know how it happened, but we were the ones who attended the Lutheran services. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So now Pollack took this maybe 35 peoople to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> , and it was a very stupid decision because first of all, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> alone had many Hlinka guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And one evening somebody came to tell us...somebody from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , "Listen, tomorrow the Nazis are coming with the Hlinka guards.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="167">There were already Germans in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="168">And they're going to take everybody.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And Pollack did not want to do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We were urged to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Pollack had a son who was 19, 20 by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Maybe 21 by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And he said, "If you don't want to go, I am taking the child (meaning me) and my mother and we are asking anybody else who wants to leave to leave with us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="174">By the way, Pollack also brought to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> his brother, the baby that was about 4 months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">All in all there were maybe over 40 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So the son of his, Marcel took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He finally... he relented. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">His brother went too with a child that was my age, and his third brother stayed with his 4 month old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So only the two families, we left at night for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Sunday morning, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> appeared with Hlinka guards, with Nazis, loaded up everybody and took them to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nemchita</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">A few miles from this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> they had to dig out their own <span class="DLF">grave</span> and they were all executed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The children were not...they're not even shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They were just buried alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I know that because after the war Pollack went to the exhumation. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And I was there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I was on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I did not see the act in itself, and I know that that was the conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The children were not even killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Did you know about what had happened, though, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And incidently, this Thury whom I mentioned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> , we had a fight shortly after we arrived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , the two of us, and either I pushed him or he fell and he had quite a large wound on his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And when they exhumed him, he still had the bandages on his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Well, now they are buried 1n a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> near this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  At the time this event took place, you and the Pollacks were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ...in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , so you had escaped this and you heard about it after you returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  You weren't directly involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  We heard about it from the son of this man who came to warn 01:23: us and this son, he was bringing us food into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And we had a plan, again worked out by this Marcel, that we will go deeper into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> until we find Partisans who were fighting the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So that's what we were trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But somehow we did not manage to connect with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Maybe they were too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They were in the center part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , and one day as I was searching for some food because we were really very short of food in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I came upon a <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span> that was owned by a name, a man named Baron Leonhardy. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He was married to a Jewish lady, but he was a German in good standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I don't know whether he was a member of the Nazi party.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  How did you get to Baron Leonhardy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  It was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where we were staying and we had some...out of...we had two blankets and we built a tent-like structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And since those two brothers, the two Pollacks were constantly quarreling together and I could not get along with the son of Pollack's brother, I always made some forays into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And it must have been a few hundred yards from where we were hiding there was this <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And I remember Leonhardy he was a tall man, sitting on the <span class="DLF">porch</span> , and I don't know whether he asked me what was I doing there, but I know that they feed me and they gave me food and I brought it to both the Pollack families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  Were you led to Baron Leonhardy by Linka?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Linka was a maid at Leonhardy's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she saw a situation and she offered that she will take us at night to the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from where they took these 35 to 40 people and that we can hide in their <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Linka was about 25 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">She took us and we were hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we would have survived the war there, but Simon Pollack ran out of cash. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He was paying Linka's father so that he can get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But he ran out of cash and Linka's father said, "Look it is...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But now it's maybe August 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The war will end and you will pay me," but Pollack concluded for some reason he has to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Otherwise we are in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Whether he assumed that they won't keep us without money, which I think was the wrong conclusion or whether the man did not have money to go and buy food, which I don't think was the case because the man was growing his food and I remember they were slaughtering a pig while we were there hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I remember big disputes between him and his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They really had fights there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They had fights that necessitated the separation of the two families in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> under the worst of circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So he asked his brother whether he has has cash and his brother told him no, he does not. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So Pollack since he was a dentist, he was missing some teeth and before we went into hiding from Barbell, he created some removable dental work out of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And he said, "I have this gold here. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I am going to send Linka's brother to sell it, and we'll have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So Linka's brother took the gold, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> , got drunk, told somebody that here he has the gold that the Jews who are in hiding in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> are selling, and he must have realized what he has done because he came back running to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he said what he had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So in a hurry it was at night, we picked ourselves up, run back into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  How long had you been in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> before that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  I don't...must have been a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And we ran there and there was sort of a small <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> that belonged to one of the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So that's where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That's where we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And what I remember a big bang and the tiles that covered the <span class="DLF">roof</span> broke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And then there was banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they dragged us out and all I remember seeing: Hlinka guards, some behind machine guns and laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I remember 3 or 4 SS men in uniforms and they were dragging us out from this <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> and as we came out, one of the Hlinka guards said, "You are going to dig a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and Pollack became hysterical and so did his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The women were very calm, and the two boys...the two of us, we were very calm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Did you have any idea what the implication of that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">At that time I knew exactly what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Let me interrupt for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">At this point, you were about...a boy of 9 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  How much awareness did you have and what were your feelings up to this point of everything that had happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  In my life, it's a very significant moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">That's the first time I remember thinking about a supernatural being, so there's God. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I was so calm that...Pollack's wife told me that I was barefooted. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">She said, "Put on shoes.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I said, "Why would I need shoes?" </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I remember the thought was, "How preposterous that she should ask me to put on shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">In a short while later we won't be any more.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I remember this thought very vividly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  You knew...you knew that you are going to die at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  That we are going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The second thing I remember that they were throwing out... Oh, actually I found out what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Why did those tiles on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> break? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They threw a grenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It did not explode. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So one of the SS men went upstairs and was throwing our belongings down. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">One of them was a sort of an attache case that broke open while it was coming down from the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and it was full of bank notes and it belonged to the brother of Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He had plenty of money, but said he didn't have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">That means had he said he has money, we would not have been in that predicament. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We would have been in hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  He didn't let his brother know at the time his brother was trying to pawn the gold tooth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And he wouldn't share the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So we are going to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Would you express that. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">The fact that I've just said, the fact about Pollack's brother's behavior and its effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He was asked whether he has any money and he said he doesn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Had he said he has money...had he just lent it to his brother, we would have been safe because I remember the number of bank notes and the bank notes were in thousand crown denominations. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">That would have saved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So as we were standing there and the man got hysterical, suddenly somebody came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , a Nazi, and gave instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I did not hear him what he was saying, but it was obvious because they stopped everything and they took us down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Later we found out that the instruction was to take us down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> , which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">county town</span> , into the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and to find out from us where the Partisans are. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That we must know because we were caught in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  So you were saved then because they thought you had information about the Partisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Precisely. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and I remember sitting next to...there were maybe just a handful of SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The rest were Hlinka guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And this SS man gave me something to eat, and I remember touching his gun and he sort of showed it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">At that time, we already knew what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nenchita</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And my thought was they are taking us somewhere else for the same purpose as they took Thurie and all the 40 people around him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  They had all been killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nenchita</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  All been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We already knew about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Before we knew, we appeared in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> , and that was where the ...sort of the ...that was the time when there were Nitra, our arrival, there was no more time for any light thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They lined us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And I remember an old Hlinka guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">At that time he seemed to me a very old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He might have been in his late 50s, but he appeared as an old man and he introduced himself to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">He said, "My name is Homola," and something to the effect, "I will make your life miserable.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And with saying this, he hit old Pollack with butt of his gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Then they crammed us into a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> which must have been very small, and there were already some prisoners and with us included, there was barely <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And we were sitting there, and I remember I felt very miserable because I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I was cold and there was no possibility to move, no possibility to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and suddenly, the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and the Hlinka guard entered and took me and took this son of Pollack's brother,Ari, threw us out, closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind them and from then on I heard only screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Must have been going on...I don't know...for maybe a half an hour or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And when I came in, I remember the first sight was Pollack's wife who was all bloody. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They beat them severely. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And then they took me and Ani and threw us back and we spent the night in this state. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It was...that was one of the worst moments of my entire experience with...with...
QUESTION:  You say that there is no more lightness. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Is this kind of a turning point in the whole experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  It was a dark moment because later on optimism again surfaced. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Hope again surfaced, but at that time it was just bleak, dark, no hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The next day, somebody opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It was a Hlinka guard, and in a very vulgar way asked us to use the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">He used very descriptive language to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and what to do there in a Slovak---in the Slovak language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  What did he actually say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  He said, ??.. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">That means go and do number | and do number 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Short while later, a man came and brought in some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And Pollack looked at him and said, 01:37: "Aren't you Mr. Kopsa?" </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And sure enough he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The non-Jewish prisoner...I don't know for what reason...I think he was a Czech originally and that might have been the reason that he was in a <span class="BUILDING">Slovak prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And that was the first spark of lightness again. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We knew somebody who 1s in a position of power in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and we know him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  How did Mr. Pollack know him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Must have been a patient of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I don't know exactly how. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I think he was a patient of his who used to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> to take a cure. </span><span class="sentence" id="330"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> is a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> , quite a well known <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> for treating rheumatism. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And then just a day or so later, Pollack was called by the commandant of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I believe his name was Cunsa. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I am almost sure 1t was Cunsa. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And he told Pollack... I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I was present when he was telling him that. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And I remember it because it was something that drew my attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">He told him in German: Wenn Ich Dich jetzt weiter schicke, das Kind geht gleich durch den Kamin. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Which means 'If I send you on now, the child will go [1mmediately] through the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> .‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And so that's how I remember also that we did not have to wait til the war's end or to be ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where there were <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> , that this was no secret that this process was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Did you know that at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Did the Pollacks know what happened to the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Before this, I know that I heard it long before the war 01:39: ended, that there was mass extermination going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I know that this was no secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So Cunsa continued and said, "Look, I will do one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">You are a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">There are plenty of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish dental offices</span> that have been closed in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Tomorrow, you will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You will select one. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We will move the entire <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> here, and you will fix our teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And Pollack somehow must have felt very happy because he told him, "That's wonderful Mr. Commandant, Herr Commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I will make you the most beautiful teeth.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And Cunsa said: Wenn ich in der Erdt bin ist se mir scheissegal ob ich gute Zaehne hab oder nicht. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">When I am buried, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference whether I have good teeth or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And from there on, sure enough, within a short period of time, might have been a week, Pollack was working as a dentist in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">His wife was helping him as an assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We had all the food in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">The negative attitude of this Hlinka guard suddenly changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They were bringing their wives in. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They had their teeth fixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And we were just having good times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  What did you, as a boy of 9, make of all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  I was...well, first of all I... was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I was now free to move to the corridors of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and one night I remember we heard some crying going on, as if 01:41: somebody was tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And sure enough, I found out that in the neighboring <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> there were Wehrmacht soldiers who tried to escape from the <span class="REGION">war front</span> , and they were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> , and they were tortured there. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And I had the opportunity to get food and to get some food to them as a 9 year old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So I felt very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  Did you...you didn't regard them as your enemies amongst them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I did not have one negative thought about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">As a matter of fact, in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> my only negative thoughts were about the Hlinka guards, because the only Nazi with whom I had something to do was Cunza who I already realized from his...what he said that he saving our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Then one night, the Allies bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> and in a hurry they had to pack us up and they sent us on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Sered</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So again was from...from a very positive situation to a very negative because suddenly we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Wooden barracks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  Was your family treated differently from the others or was everybody from there sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  I think they just had to vacate the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I don't know what happened to the Nazi soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I have some idea because after the war, I was asked to make a deposition about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cunsa</span> , and I said what he did for us and it's my understanding that he was executed because he signed execution orders for some partisans and maybe for some of these deserters as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So he was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> , we found...
QUESTION:  What was the trip...trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I don't even know how we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Whether it was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">In Sered we spend a few weeks and the commandant there was the infamous Bruno who, to this day, is somewhere in hiding in <span class="COUNTRY">Syria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And Bruno took it upon himself to torture Simon Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He found out that he was a prominent prisoner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> , and he must have felt a need to reduce him to the level of every other inmate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So he would call him to...and he tortured him. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">He beat him, and Pollack was a slight man, short, and I remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Every time he came back, he was quite shaken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We spend a few weeks..I don't know how long in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> with the women
QUESTION:  You went. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Not the others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">There was a whole transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I don't know exactly the date, but our number was: sechs und zwanzig zwo einund vierzig [26241]. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">This was my number.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  You were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> for just a couple of weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  Might have been a couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  And then when you were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , would you tell us some details about how that took place and how you got there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  I got there, there was a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">You go left, you go right. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Only it wasn't...uh...
QUESTION:  Was there a train trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Would you tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">First of all, they separated us, and I remember Pollack crying there with his wife and I remember it appeared to me a quite a paradoxical(ly) and outright grotesque situation because they were constantly quarreling. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And now that they were being separated and Bruno was standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He was crying...Pollack was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He said, "If we survive this, I will be...I don't know, a model husband and we will never have these quarrels, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And Bruno was standing there and I remember pulling Pollack's hat on his eyes and saying: Wir kennen Dich schon , Du alter Simulant. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Which means we know each other already, you old faker, because Simulant in German is applied to a person who pretends pain or...
QUESTION:  And you as a boy at 9 had considerable grown up a good deal by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">01:47:
ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I was looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I knew I have to have a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where I will be able to see <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because there were just four small <span class="DLF">windows</span> , much high up for me to see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So I thought if I am next to the <span class="DLF">door</span> ...I did not know that it will be slammed shut...that I will be able to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So I placed myself there and another woman came with her son and I consider him a spoiled brat because they pushed me away from my <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and this is going to be for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And I couldn't defend myself and there was nobody else to defend me, so I was pushed aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But then he had to move because they but a bucket there. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And finally they slammed shut the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , and we were standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I don't know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It was not hot, so it was bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was fall of 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved, I know the bucket was full. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And once the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved, the bucket tipped over and this kid who took my <span class="NPIP">spot</span> got the bulk of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So I remember deriving some satisfaction from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I don't know how long the trip...trip took to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">From...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , it might be less than 200 miles, somewhere between 150 and 200 miles, but I know that it was either 2 days or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Because the reason...every time there was a transport with military going back and forth, they put this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...they side tracked it, and we stand there. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Finally, we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  During that 2 or 3 days, did you get any food or water or air?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I don't know what the supply was. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I remember air because I remember that somebody would open that <span class="DLF">door</span> and I saw something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I have no idea what we ate on this trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I only remember there was quite a lot of moaning and there must have been quite a lot of sickness and I remembered tremendous overcrowding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Anybody die?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  I do not remember, but the overcrowding was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The only negative thoughts are about the overcrowding. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I do not remember either thirst or hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And once...now we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and again there's a very negative first impression because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">garrison city</span> surrounding by a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> , by moats, and we arrived at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> and was early in the morning and was a lot of noise, a lot of screaming, "Raus, Raus, Raus.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And they registered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And I was with the woman...with Pollack's wife and she was assigned to a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> which again was considered prominent. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">She was assigned to what was called in German Entaeusung, a place where they deloused people. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They go through <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and shaving and get rid of lice because lice we had...Lice we already had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So I stayed with her for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I don't know for how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And then suddenly transports started arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I understand that the plan was to concentrate as many people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> as possible, and then to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Blow it up or...I don't know in what way, but that was...the plan was to liquidate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  This was in November, December 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  This is already December, maybe January of 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And so she had to get rid of me because they had so much work. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Then my transports were coming, so I was put with Dutch children into a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">There were already no Czech or Slovak children. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They were all sent on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Just... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was basically just a...they called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sammellager</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It was ghetto, but it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sammellager</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">That means they...they brought in people for further transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So I was put with Dutch children. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And now the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> started arriving and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was built...it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">garrison city</span> by Maria Theresia in the 18th Century. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was supposed to hold 7,000 people and at one point it got up to, I believe, to somewhere 40,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I remember prisoners arriving from other camps, and that was a terrible sight because there I remember dead bodies, terribly emaciated people, which we up to that point did not see in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was always maintained as a model <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so when the Red Cross, the Danish Red Cross came they would take them there and they would show that the Jews have their self government. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Incidentally, I worked for sometime as an Ordnanz. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">That means a runner for the elder of the Judenrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  Were you there when the Red Cross visit was made?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">At that day when they arrived, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch home</span> , and I remember they prepared us for the visit and I remember very well they gave us each a glass of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">By that time I haven't seen milk for God knows how long, and they said, "When they appear, you will drink the milk.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The reason probably I remember it because the milk was boiled and when you boil milk you get a what I call a skin, and that's probably the only food that I would not eat at gunpoint, and I remember not drinking that milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So the Red Cross came and everything was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">There was an orchestra playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There were <span class="BUILDING">cafes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We had what they called Ghetto Gelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">You couldn't buy anything for it, but there was money in five or six different denominations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Did the Red Cross people talk to you at all, ask you questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  I don't remember them talking to us at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I just remember them being accompanied by some high SS official and I remember the SS official in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where I was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> , three high, and he went and with his glove took a sample whether there was dust. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  Remember how you felt about that at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Seemed to be like a curious event sort of a welcome change from monotonous routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresientstadt</span> 1n itself, up to the point when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were arriving, was bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">If one was free of disease and if one was in a situation like me, if one basically had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> for himself, not too overcrowded, and there was some food available and what was not available I was always able to either steal or I remember there was one of these fake <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> that they have and I would go there and they somehow took pity on me and found even a pair of shoes which I did not have up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So there was always...as compared to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> which was looked and was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and it gave an appearance of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and give an appearance of some semblance of normalcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">There were Jewish policemen in some funny uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">There was the Judenrat which had some bureaucratic tasks. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">As I said I worked as a runner for the Judenaeltester, whose name was Murmelstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We used to call him Murmelswine because he wasn't one of the nicest persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">After the war, I understand he became a financial advisor to the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He succeeded a man who went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> Edelstein, who was the Judenaeltester before him. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So life had a semblance of normalcy or what I would consider normalcy at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And a few short months afterwards, we were liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  What happened after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came and the things change? </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Did that lead into liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  Things changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I remember every day seeing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> with dead bodies heading toward the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The most frightening thing up to the point was when somebody was taken to the small <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">There was what was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grosse Festung</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">That was the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And there was <span class="BUILDING">Kleine Festung</span> , small <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> , which was on the outskirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And if somebody was taken to the small <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> meant that you could write him or her off. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Separately administered, was administered by a sadistic SS man and his two sadistic daughters who took pleasure in letting German shepherds loose on prisoners and he the SS man who administered the Kleine Festung was a sadistic guy named Joko, was executed after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">While in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> itself, we barely saw an SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">The head of the camp was Rahn(?). </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He was an SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I remember seeing him twice or three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">There was another SS man, Seidel, whom we would see from time to time on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But otherwise there were Czech policemen, who were quite decent, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I was also involved in a plot. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> coming and they're bringing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and one of the engineers wanted to take me out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> smuggle me out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> take me with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And I remember climbing the engine and somebody caught me and sort of pushed me or kicked me in a very forceful way. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Otherwise, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> showed positive human aspect of fellow prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">The women who were teaching children to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Ther was some attempt to teach us how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Before I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> there were operas staged there. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Clearly, there were some people, some humanbeings who lit up the prevailing gloom with good deeds toward you. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">What are your views about the way you were treated in general by people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  You see it has always been enormously helpful to me, to my thoughts, to my psyche, the fact that there were many good people to whom I owe my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">There was so much negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">For example when they led us from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they wanted to execute us...when they led us through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> and loaded us up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> taking us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> , I remember people standing in the <span class="DLF">doorways</span> and laughing (clearing throat) because we were quite a grotesque lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">This is balanced (clearing throat)...excuse me...by a person like Linka, even by her brother who got drunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  Rudolph?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  This was Linka's brother I believe his name was also Rudolph. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But he paid a terrible price. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He spent the rest of the war in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , came back a cripple, and died prematurely. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But there were many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cunza</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And from my thinking, it was always important to know that not all this dark, black, and what very often surprises me is that when we discussed this event, we need a black and white story, that we refuse to think in shades. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">That when one brings in one good SS man as if this just distorted the story, while the opposite is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">One good SS man doesn't change anything on the bestiality of the whole establishment of the SS, of their deeds, but it is a reality that there was one positive humanbeing or maybe just positive vis-a-vis me. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I need that for my assessment and for my view of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I don't want to think in terms of...
QUESTION:  So you don't come out of this really embittered against the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">For me to know the whole story is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">The million children who died is as important to know as to know the fact that some...I don't know...some four thousand Jews survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> along, with the help of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I met a man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I will tell you just this one episode and really... seldom break down and cry but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">They were doing a documentary about the Kristallnacht, 50th anniversary of the Kristallnacht, and I spoke to a man who 1s approaching 70. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">He lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in the open till the beginning of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">With the yellow star he was traveling the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and he was working believe it or not for some form of a Jewish community that was still functioning and he said he would get on a public transport system and somebody would push an apple in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And one day he was returning <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from his errands through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with his star, and he saw that they were loading his parents on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So he said, "Well, this 1s it.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So he ran to a woman that he knew, a German woman, who was hiding him from the beginning of 1944 until the end of World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was close to a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">She was sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">She had a <span class="INT_SPACE">one room apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The <span class="INT_SPACE">one room apartment</span> had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , maybe three by two meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">For this year and a half she was sleeping in this <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> and this teenager was sleeping in that one <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> for close to a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So this is important to include in the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Things are not entirely black and white.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  Let's get you back to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Are there any other episodes there that might be interesting to talk about during your stay before the liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  There are many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">There are many nationalities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Everybody was looking for a survival method. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I was constantly hungry and looking for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I had a friend with whom we would roam the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and just look for an opportunity to get something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The best opportunity was when the new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> arrived and people brought some food so you could go and you could try to acquire it, to steal it. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So I remember we stole a big jar of jam and we ate it in hiding and we came back down and they were already two women in each other's hair accusing the other of stealing this jar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  The two accused the other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Pardon. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">One accused the other of stealing it while we ate it just a few minutes before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I was as I said, I was a street smart kid and I developed connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">There was a doctor from_Piestany, Dr. Volstein, who came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with his wife and with his daughter, my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Then after the war I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And I found him a job, peeling potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It was a life saving job because peeling potatoes meaning he also had a extra potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And he was very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He said that if he survives the war, after the war he will do anything for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And he survived the war and came back to this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> , in which they took us, where I after the war where I continued my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> education. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I know that he wanted to make good on his promise he will do anything for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So he wanted me to go out with his daughter, but didn't work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">She was a rather homely looking girl I remember and...but I even told somebody that. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It was rather an ungrateful gesture. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And it was...was a funny...was a funny thing because this man who returned from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and his daughter, they just happened to look very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I know in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> it sounds offensive now, but we used to talk that way in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Somebody looks Jewish and somebody doesn't look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it's today it's difficult to imagine because very few people we walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I wouldn't know whether they are Jewish or not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But there we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And they looked very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But his daughter, when I would tell her...she became a Protestant after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I would say, "Do you remember our days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And she would tell me, "I was never in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ."</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We only found out after the war that preparations were going on to...to kill everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">We also heard that Romm who was the SS commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wanted to save himself and revealed the plan to somebody, and that the Soviets had to do some maneuver with the army of Marshall Koniev, and instead of going directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , which at that time there was an uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> going on...that they just made some...or part of the army made some detour and liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> in a surprise move. </span><span class="sentence" id="598"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> is about 40 miles north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So it was very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">We woke up one morning and there were the Soviets in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">There was a typhus epidemic going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I remember them working day and night trying to save people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  So you had a favorable view of the Russian liberators?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Many people died after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We were not let out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> immediately after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I believe we were liberated May 8th and we did not leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> until the middle of June or so because of the typhus epidemic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  How about the guards? </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Were they still there when the Russians came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  The Czech police nothing happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The SS was no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So we did not see them, but as I said we saw very little of them during the Nazi era.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  How did you feel at that point when you woke up, went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and there were Russians instead of Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">ANSWER:  We felt very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">We were very close to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I remember I then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> we left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , the capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  How did you feel then knowing the war is over and you had survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Did you have any conscientiousness of that at the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  The overall feeling is very important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">When I look at that, when I think back of what I was thinking, it is incomprehensible to me that what I was thinking was this all 1s normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">That somebody took my father; that my mother is not there; that I am with strangers; that I'm going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; that we are isolated as Jews and singled out for something because of the negative treatment; that some how this all is..it's normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">That's the pogram of the day, a pogram of the month, a pogram of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And we were liberated with just a continuum. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It was the next stage, but no cathartic relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  As a child with no experience of anything else, this seemed like the way life was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  That's what's like. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I remember one difference I noticed. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We started our journey back to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> which is just a few miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> from where they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We were no longer in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We were in a normal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Took 3 days again because it was just after the war, troop movements etcetera, but it was a normal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped we could get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I remember playing with other boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So this was a dramatic change, but again it was just as this entire episode through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and through the hiding had ups and downs, and there were some extremely sad moments some moments of resignation, some movements of this is it, this is the end like we would be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">But there were also highlights. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">There were also some funny moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">There were jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So we returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> and a few weeks later, with Marcel who in the meantime survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I did not mention when we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with Pollack with Marcel with his 20 year old son, he tried to connect with the Partisans and he left us one night that he's going to find the partisans and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">What happened the Nazis caught him. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And he went through interim camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Not only did he survive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but when the Russians liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he became an interpreter for the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And the Russians took him down south to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And we went...when we came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , means from the northwest, he came from the southeast from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And he was wearing sort of a Russian uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And then he started searching for his father, for Simon. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And Simon came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to sort of a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because he could barely stand on his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So Simon came then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , so we all met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Nothing ...nothing happened to us, to...to...
QUESTION:  You all survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  We all survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Could you tell us now, maybe not in the detail, just kind in a general way the things that have happened to you, what your life has been like, and outline since you since the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Well, we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Pollack opened his dental practice there. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">That was the beginnings were not too good. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">There was a lot of anti- Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I began swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="658"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> is a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">It has thermal spas, and one can swim winter, summer, and I became a competitive swimmer the age of 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">My whole life revolved around going to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> until 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">At the age of 19, I went to...I was accepted to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I completed <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , then I was drafted in the Air Force, 22 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">After that I practiced law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  You were married there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Married. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1968 just before the Russians marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">An irony 1s that they installed a communist regime, so from the Russians that we liked and admired, they became the oppressor. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So escaped from there in 68 just before the Russians occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1968. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Nobody needed a Czech-trained lawyer, so I got my Master's in social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And then I worked in the field of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I worked for a Jewish organization involved in bringing refugees out of countries of oppression and bringing them to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Then I worked, almost 10 years, for the Anti-Defamation League as Director of European Affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  And you have a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">ANSWER:  I have a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We have a 15 year old son, and by a previous marriage I have two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">One is 29. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">One 1s 27. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And we live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  And, finally, can you tell us, Mr. Reiss, how you think all this has affected you. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">What...in these experiences at such an early age, what impact did it have on you in your later life and the kind of person you became?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">You know I've been around for quite a while and it seems to me that there are two sentiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">One, when I pause for awhile and I see what can be crammed into this relatively short few years, it is mind boggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">On the other hand, I feel sometimes when I talk, especially with younger people, that in a way it is as thorough a <span class="BUILDING">school of life</span> as one can get. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">How it affected me, I would like to think that it did not affect me in a negative way, except in some ways, for example, we very often discuss it with my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Joyce has an enormous family, somewhere all forty first cousins and we would show up on all these family occasions, and I have my wife and my three sons so compared to her family, I feel like a soloist there. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And that brings out sometimes very negative feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Why am I in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  Feelings of sorrow?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  In a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">The other thing that I still do not understand quite well, but I know that these are the feelings that when I was growing up I never missed my parents as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Did not occur to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They're simply not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I used to call the Pollack family...him I used to call Father and her I used to call Mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And when I became independent, grown up, I suddenly began missing my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And to this day, I don't think of myself as a victim. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Matter of fact, I dislike the notion. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So I don't think I am a victim. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Thank God, I function like any other human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I feel that once I already had to go through that experience that it enriched me in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">The saddest thought is that my father was 15 years younger than I am now was just as intelligent, bright good man, just taken and killed like an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I don't have the thoughts about my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">My mother died fighting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">She was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">She was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">She lost, but she lost fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So I don't have negative feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  There was some dignity in her death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  Precisely. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So those are some of the thoughts, thoughts about my parents come to mind daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">For myself, I don't know whether it's a coping mechanism, but I always had the ability and I applied to life in general that perhaps when things become a little bit uncomfortable I can take myself out of the situation and become a spectator rather than a participant. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And I feel that it's a helpful device.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Maybe that helped you a bit during the experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And...and also I'm trying to look in stories for a...for all sides of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I will give you an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Old Pollack, that's what I call him now. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">He has been dead for 20 years, but we had a very nice relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and he was sort of a jokester. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">He always looked for the funny in a situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , they used to take them almost daily to clear the rubble from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> after the bombardment. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And he would tell me a story and he found it hilarious and the way he described it, 1t was hilarious. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">He was a very short man and he had two fellow prisoners who were giants compared to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So he would always go with them because they would grab a beam and they would carry this beam and he, so that he doesn't have to carry anything, he would be in the middle and he would sort of hang on this beam. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And, of course, this did not escape attention of one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> , and they beat the daylights out of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">But when he was telling me this story, he wasn't telling it with sorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">He was telling it as a funny episode that one would see in a...Buster Keaton situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Maybe I learned a little bit from ...from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Okay, do you think there is anything else that you, now that we are going to finish, that you'd like to say anything else that maybe you thought of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I would like to. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">One thing disturbs me enormously now. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">As I mentioned to you, I am an advisor to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And some very unpleasant things are going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at this moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">The Slovaks are striving for separatism, but they would like to pick up where they left off in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So Monsignor Tiso who used to be the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> under Hitler, installed by Hitler, tried after the war as a war criminal, executed as a war criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">His memory 1s being revived now as a martyr. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">There are attempts to cannonize him. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">There are anti- Semitic episodes in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">The man who was one of the driving forces behind the 1989 revolution in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> ...what Havel did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> this man did in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">His name is Feder Gor. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">He was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">He's 46 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Three months ago, he had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because he cannot walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> somebody not spitting in his face saying, "You dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">You should have died in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 3 weeks ago, and I met with some Catholics who work for the Central Committee of Catholics in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="750">Coughing) And I asked them...I said, "The whole world knows about this and the whole world that reads and follows political events in the newly emerging democracies in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Why is it that in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> where a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> has such power, similar power as it has in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , nobody stands up and says anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="752">How come among you German Catholics nobody stands up and says, "Who was Monsigneur Tiso, and it is obscene to try to rehabilitate this man? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">How 1s it that you don't protest against the interviews given by some of the Slovak people in political power now who say.... who refer to the alleged...this is a quote alleged deportation of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So how come nobody's doing anything now when there is no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> any more for standing up and saying something? </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And there's just no answer to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  Well, you've given us a wonderful account of the alleged atrocities which you experienced, and we thank you very much for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  I thought it was a very dramatic close, but she wants to ask you a few more questions so let's see what she has to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I understood that pretty well Linda. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I don't think there's any problem about that from my... How he got from... I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I really don't follow you, Linda. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">You'll have to repeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Linda wants a little more detail from you about how you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> and what it was like for you as a child there. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I'd like to have a little more detail about how you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> , and what it was like for you...for you as a child there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">How you got there and what it was like there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">The Pollacks used to have maid who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">When we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> , and we saw that we have to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardio</span> ...becoming dangerous there, Simon Pollack thought of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> as the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to...to go and hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">As I said, it was a ridiculous notion. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Maybe one or two people could hide there, but to bring 40 people was suicidal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Just a few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  And what was it like there...there during those few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  Well, I remember I was playing a lot with Thury, and the local boys were quite antagonistic towards us, so I came up with a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I told them that we have a soccer ball, a real one, not one made out of fabric as they used in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and that I have soccer uniforms for two teams. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And they thought here is this new kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I was probably better dressed than they were, so I must have made an impression of a rich kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And this brought out great respect for us, but I remember we were being nudged everyday where are the uniforms and I don't know what I keep telling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Probably that it's coming, it's coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And so these are some of the thoughts I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I also remember that we lived in very crammed <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> in somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I remember every time people had so many guests, wanted or unwanted, they resorted to killing a pig because that would feed many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I remember A funny episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Simon Pollack lending a hand to the peasant killing this pig which had to be killed clandestinely at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Otherwise, there was a forced portion that one had to give up to the...for the... I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">There was some central collecting system of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Those are some of the things that I remember from my days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">QUESTION:  Okay. (</span><span class="sentence" id="792">Long, Long pause) The peasant who warned you of the pending massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">How did that happen and what...in a kind of consecutive way, tell us about that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">02:33:
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">He must have come from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> , and somebody must have spoken about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  Tell us who came and how that came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  This was a man from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who had a young son, also named Rudolph, and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> and he must have heard from somebody that this Aktion 1s being prepared, that the Nazis are coming the following day. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I remember how they were pooh, poohing the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">They said, "Well, tomorrow is Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Nobody is going to come on Sunday and we have time.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But this is the father of this Rudolph. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Incidentally, this Rudolph was a young boy, maybe 16, 17 and after the war when we returned Pollack took him in as an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And he worked for him in the <span class="BUILDING">dental lab</span> as a apprentice until 1948 and in 1948 he was drafted into the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Was already after the Communists have taken over power in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and he was a border guard and he escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and he came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the Korean War started and they drafted him and he fell in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  And he was the one who warned you about...
QUESTION:  He was the one who warned us, who brought us then food, some food into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">ANSWER:  You all went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">QUESTION:  Between... Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">This was between the massacre in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> and between Linka taking us to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">The young boy again had tremendous responsibility taken on him by getting some food in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">There was six of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">It was quite a group to feed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">What do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Uh... You were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> how long 1s it? </span><span class="sentence" id="816">When you were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  Tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Say, "When I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ," and then describe what it was like, whether you were hungry, whether there were fights, what the events were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  Well, when I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , there was several incidences that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">First of all, the weather was not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It was raining quite often. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And we had just a blanket that they somehow tried to put over a small <span class="DLF">clearing</span> and make a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> like structure, but what bothered me the most were these quarrels going on between these two adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And that was the time when Simon's son, Marcell, left to look whether we could get to the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So these two men were left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">There were two children, and two women and it was a very difficult time because they behaved like two brats. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But I also forgot to mention that when Marcel failed to return, they sensed that he was caught so his mother was hysterical constantly and Simon became hysterical as well and would pretend that he's going to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">That means he would take a pocket knife and make sure that all of us saw it and ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> and his wife would send me to take care of him so he doesn't commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I remember how angry I was because I was 8 or 9. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I did not verbalize it that way, but I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I felt somebody should take care of me and here I have this idiot pretending that he is going to commit suicide and instead of me being able to look for some food or for something, I have to babysit for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I am sure not put it in those words, but I remember that my anger was...
QUESTION:  You were a child having to baby an adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">But it was of no use at that point, as he proved to be of use in other instances, like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> when he knew to do something useful to fix their teeth which kept us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> so, again, he was a figure up and down in my books.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  "Say when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ," and then go in and describe what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">You as a child, what was life in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> like and what did you feel there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> I remember the worst thing about it was, again, the quarrel between those two men, and I also remember the brother of Simon was an extremely religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And we had very little to eat and this peasant must have had a terrible time, Linka's father, must have had a terrible time to get food for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And we were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Somehow...I don't know why, but Simon's brother...first of all, he had the money that I was talking about that appeared and suddenly when they were throwing it out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , but he also had some durable food. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Specifically, he had bacon. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And he would ask Ary, my age and his wife, whose name was Irene. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I remember the words and I remember as if it was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">He'd say, Irinka willst Du Speck. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Do you want bacon? </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And, again, I remember the anger that he would not ask me or Simon or his wife whether we want something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">That's number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And number two, I remember thinking already at that time, "If you are such a religious man, how come you're stuffing yourself with bacon?" </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Maybe I thought about this only after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I cannot recall exactly whether these were my thoughts, but he was asking in such a provocative way that I knew that I would have wanted to hit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I disliked the man as you can see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">QUESTION:  Uh...Go over again the time you were captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">The sequence when you heard the the noise overhead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  We were hidden in that <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  Do it in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  A few hours before that and I remember we were laying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and really despondent because at that point we did not know what...what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And suddenly just out of the blue, there was this crashing noise, the roof tiles breaking and followed very shortly by strong kicking or banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I believe somebody smashed the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we just...1 remember hearing the words ven, ven which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Out. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Out. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And we went very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They assembled us. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">There was this notion or gesture of start digging <span class="DLF">graves</span> or a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">There was the hysterical reaction of the two men and much less from the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Me just standing there and waiting with Ary, me not having shoes and the wife of Pollack urging me to put on shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I said, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I remember that that was the moment when I thought about God and I thought about this preposterous instruction that I should put on shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Then I remember the Hlinka guards throwing out our belongings from the <span class="DLF">window</span> and what I failed to mention that when shortly afterwards, while we were still present there waiting, they threw in hand grenades and they set it on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">This whole structure just burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">It was at the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">There was a big <span class="DLF">clearing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And I see it burning and shortly afterwards, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> ...this man on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> appeared, said something. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Now, I know it was to take us to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">02:44:
QUESTION:  Did you felt that you are being taken to your death?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  We felt we are being taken the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thury</span> was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">But throughout this entire time, I did not have what would be an appropriate reaction to the realization this might be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I was very calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Maybe what contributed to it was that the man who was sitting next to me, that was either a Hlinka guard or it was one of the Germans, was basically kindly to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">He gave me something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">He sort of let me play with his gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I believe I thought if it was so dark this would not be the scenario. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Something to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">QUESTION:  That it was so dark?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  If it was...if the picture was so bleak, if the outcome would be so devastating...
QUESTION:  He wouldn't be nice to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER:  This would not be the atmosphere in which it would take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">It would have to be sort of an overture that would be much more negative with no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> left for anything resembling a spark of hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And here somebody who is supposed to lead you to execution and supposed to be and...and in reality is behaving in a kindly way. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Of course, today I would know better. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I have an experience talking to an SS doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">His name is Dr. Muntz who I believe still practices medicine near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> who was one of the Auschwitz doctors tried in the Auschwitz trial in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> in 1947, the only one set free because he provably helped Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And he was not involved in the selection process. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">He was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Institute of Hygiene</span> attached to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berkinau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And he would tell me stories about Mengele, how they would walk and he said he enjoyed talking to Mengele because Mengele was never foaming at his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He was always elegant, always thoughtful, always had interesting things to say, and as they were walking Moontz and Mengele....Mengele would say, "Wait, I just have to stop at my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So they would go together there, and there would be a beautiful little girl sitting and there would be some assistant obviously involved in some experiments or something, but the girl was very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And Mengele would stroke her head and said: Ein huebsches Maedel and then he would take out a candy and give the child a candy and then they would depart, Muench and Mengele and just he would turn to the assistant, say: Jetzt geben Sie das Kind eine Spritze. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Let's now give an injection to the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">QUESTION:  Inject phenol into her heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Within 5 minutes later, the child would be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">So comparing this to my feelings on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , that it cannot be so bad when the man is nice to me 1s a foolish thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But at the moment...at the moment when it happened it was a useful thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , you had a friend named Peter, would you say, "When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , I..."
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Well, In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , I...I did have a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">His name was Peter Rothberger , and he wasn't really a close friend but his mother and the wife of Pollack they worked together in this Entwesung(?). </span><span class="sentence" id="907">That means where transport arrived where people got deloused, showered, shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And Peter and I would roam the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">streams</span> and take care of our needs, try to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I met Peter then after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and he was studying philosophy but then somehow I lost contact with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">An interesting thing was that after the war whether it was with Peter or whether it was with this girl, Monica, that I mentioned, the daughter of the doctor, one couldn't talk the past with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">There was a complete denial on their part because there were so few of us that to start this conversation would mean to bring in the unpleasant realization that we are Jews, a real handful left because those who survived, most of them left for then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> between 45 and 48 before the creation of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So there was few of us left that they did not want to hear that they were part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Matter of fact, I remember much later when I was working already as a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , the entire <span class="BUILDING">office</span> had one Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Everybody knew that he was a Jew except this one man. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I enjoyed teasing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So when we would pass ech other in the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , I would say Sholem Aleichem and he would look at me and say, "You Fool. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">What are you saying.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That was the same with Peter. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">We just found after the war we had nothing to talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  And you'd been so close there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">QUESTION:  How about the New Year's Eve party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Rosa, Simon's Pollack's wife, and Eva decided to make a New Year's Eve party. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And somebody gave them a recipe to make cake out of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So they got some bread together. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">They were also in a privileged position to get more food because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that were arriving, some people had supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">So they made a cake out of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And I remember we had a very nice New Year's Eve party. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">We were included. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">The two women had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> all for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">That was an indication of their privileged status. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But that's about all I remember about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Just that we had cake made out of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I can still taste it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  And this was just before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> closed down?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  This was still long before it closed down because it was beginning of January, and the transports with all these inmates of other camps were arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">QUESTION:  Did it seem normal or natural to you to have a jolly party at that time under those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  It wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">There there wasn't singing or merriment. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">It was...it just looked compared to the daily life, it looked very elegant because here you had separate <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">All of us...there were...I...1 have never seen ...never seen or I have just seldom seen just four people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">The <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> ...when one visualizes it, it's always hundreds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">You never visualize or seldom visualize the situation where you are alone with somebody, talking alone with somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Almost didn't exist! </span><span class="sentence" id="947">There were always people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  So being alone and being private was a blessed exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  It was already some sign of situation that denoted... affluence or except, exceptional well being.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">QUESTION:  How about the period when you were a lonely child in the Dutch children's barrack? </span><span class="sentence" id="951">What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  That was to be a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Actually in the later years, I thought a lot about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I was the only Czech child there among Dutch children. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And you suddenly become someone who is identified if not as an enemy then as a foreign body that doesn't belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I couldn't communicate with the Dutch children. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">They were beating me up because I was on the third <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and I had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I constantly had a cold and at night I would have accidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I would wet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and it all came down, and the one who was sleeping under me, even under the second person wasn't too happy with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">They...
QUESTION:  You wet your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> from urinating or from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And so they would beat me up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  Did you wet your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> throughout this whole period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">The only time I remember was when I was in this <span class="BUILDING">Dutch home</span> and maybe it happened once or twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">But it did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Also I had mumps when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And I remember almost exactly when it was because I remember I had mumps and the wife of Pollack came to visit me, and they got the news in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I remember her telling me this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  How did how was that news greeted by people.</span></p>
