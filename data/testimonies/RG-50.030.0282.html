QUESTION:  Would you tell us where -- where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , March 27, 1915.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Would you be so kind to tell us a few words about your childhood, where you lived, and how was your day to day life during your childhood? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Also, a few words about the background of your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My father was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">He was, during World War I, in the Austrian army as a physician and therefore then, wh-when the war started, the family went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> during the war, and stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> til 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">After the war we returned to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukavina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My father was a physician in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which -- the name of is [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">This was a community of 5,000 people, and he was serving the area of 15 such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , so a population over 50,000, it was in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suceava</span> , which was the topic of this [indecipherable] in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , first in [indecipherable] at the <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , the four grades and then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> where I stayed with [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> in 1932, made the baccalaureate, and during the -- my stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> there was some anti-Semitism in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , but some of it being [indecipherable] with a minority Jews, so it wasn’t felt too badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">There were some fights between students. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It was -- one element which I remember was with one of the -- during the baccalaureate, one of the st -- Jewish students was killed by a Romanian student dur -- while we were waiting for the results of the baccalaureate, which was -- at that time was [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was a very famous, very well known, anti-Semitic group, [indecipherable] and there was a big funeral for [indecipherable] [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I -- after I finished my schooling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> in 1933, Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But being raised in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which had -- half of the population was German [indecipherable] population, I had German friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which we were together [indecipherable] and as soon as Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they stopped talking to me and they stopped chasing me and they stopped knowing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So it was the first encounter where the influence of the Nazi regime had an effect even before <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> -- while <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was still under the government, the democratic government that had nothing to do with Hitler, but the Germans beca -- stopped talking to me and ignoring me [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I went to study to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where the situation, even though it was a [indecipherable] regime, for the Jews there was no discrimination and I had very good experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">During all my studies, even when the -- when the Hitler-Mussolini pact came into effect and they wanted the Jew -- th-the Jewish professors were eliminated from the -- from teaching and from [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And we were supposed to go at the end to the exams separated from the Gentiles, but the Italians refused to do it and so we went together, because there was always a very good, spirit of camit -- camaraderie. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It happened at one time, they had [indecipherable] students in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> and they want -- they made a big fuss and so on, so the Italian students went with us again th-there. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So they were really very nice, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was lucky enough to live in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a -- of a [indecipherable] and with his family that I was really like a -- like a son in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so there was no problem during my stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">In 1940, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ch-Chernowitz</span> was occupied by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I think it was 28 of June, 1940, and we were left in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> without [indecipherable] with -- with our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">There were, at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> there were several hundred Jewish students [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , from all over Europe, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , from [indecipherable], from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We were studying in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> -- in -- in a foreign country was because under <span class="BUILDING">Romanian universities</span> there was no more scholarships and you couldn’t be accepted [indecipherable] when you were accepted, you were beaten up and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">There was a lot of -- unpleasant to be studying there, so therefore many studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , some in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So, we are talking still about 1940, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> was occupied un -- came under the Russian [indecipherable] and we were blocked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> , we didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We had to go -- to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> , to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was already the pact with Mussolini - Hitler and it was already war against [indecipherable] together with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> against <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So we decided, two colleagues who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> at that time, to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Everybody consulted us, and said it would be better to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> instead of staying here where there is [indecipherable] anti-Semitism and danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So, I went with another colleague to the main <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , to take care of my Romanian passport, which expired during my stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and got a new passport, in end of July of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> and a group of other colleagues decided that we are leaving and we are going back to the -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We -- I went with another colleague, and a group left a week before us, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We stayed in ca -- another couple of days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We arranged in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> that time they should expulse us, expulsion from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to the <span class="DLF">Yugoslavian border</span> so we didn’t have to [indecipherable] and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were very nice, the Italians, they were very forthcoming, and we s-started -- and we started our [indecipherable] back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Everything went [indecipherable] went -- went okay til we came to some -- I don’t remember exactly the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the tra -- 1-1-1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there came the Iron Guard, members of the Iron Guard who were out of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and came back [indecipherable] the regime in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> changed, so they came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They started going with their [indecipherable] coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , they started to make remarks with, we are going to take care of you when you come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We didn't mind, we didn’t pay much attention to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Anyway, we didn’t have a -- much choice, we went -- we were supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> we had relatives, and so we figured we [indecipherable] to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> and from there we will see what -- what will happen further, if we should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We came to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jimbolia</span> which was the <span class="DLF">border</span> and from there we were supposed to go to [indecipherable] which was the first big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jimbolia</span> , while we were waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to proceed, was who -- the - they came back, they took our passport and said we have to come down, we cannot enter <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Who took your passport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  The border police.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Romanian, or Yugoslav?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Romanian, Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We was in the <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">border</span> it was the Romanian, [indecipherable] was the Yugoslavian part of the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So we -- they took away our passports and they said you cannot proceed because you are communists and we cannot let you in, and they took away our passports and arrested us and kept us 1n the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jimbolia</span> , and they -- it was 24 hours, after 24 hours they decided that we have to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They took away our documents, our passports, our luggage, everything, and at midnight some [indecipherable] which is the border patrols of the Romanian, took us with the order that’s if we try to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , we will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They have orders to shoot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So we started, my friend and I and the third person who was with us, started to walk through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> in the direction <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And we were sure that they are going to shoot us as soon as we got in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , because they said they have orders to shoot us if we tried to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So we wandered through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> for a couple of hours, til we heard barking of dogs, and we knew that we are in the vicinity of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So we continued to walk into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and we found there this -- there were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , letters on the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and so on, so we knew we are in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Start wandering at night and were around four or five o’clock in the morning, and without documents, without anything, without money, without any means. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Started walking and we are looking for some names which would sound Jewish, maybe a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> or [indecipherable] that we could get some [indecipherable] and maybe get in touch with our relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , which were at that time still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">While we were walking, wandering through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the early morning hours, there came a border patrol who spoke only Serbian, and we couldn’t communicate with [indecipherable] with him and he took us to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in [indecipherable] these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border villages</span> , and there a blonde, tall Serbian guy from the border police came and greeted us, and took us to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and let us wash up. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We were dirty from the walk in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And told the wife to prepare a breakfast for us, and kept us there til noon because the next day to the main -- main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with this to -- the <span class="DLF">border</span> there, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belica Chachinda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And he kept us there til noon time and then he took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belica Chachinda</span> where the -- where the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> chief was already notified that [indecipherable] Jews are on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belica Chachinda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He came, he treated us very friendly, he said, you -- we will take you, there is a Jew, a Mr. Frankel, who was in the import export business for cattle, and he will take care of you for the moment, til we find out what to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And really we came to this Mr. -- Mr. Frankel, and found that our colleagues who left a week before, they were all there at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And so we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Mr. Frankel, and we started [indecipherable] what to do next. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">In the meantime we telephoned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> and we got in touch with relatives of ours, and one of the relatives was in the -- in fact in the reserves and the officer in the Romanian army in the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , still stationed somewhere in -- in the vicinity of -- came through the <span class="DLF">border</span> to start to negotiate what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So it lasted another week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">In the meantime the brother of Mr. Frankel went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> to talk to the <span class="BUILDING">Russian embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Yeah, I want to m-mention that when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> on the Romanian passport, I went also to the <span class="BUILDING">Russian embassy</span> -- to the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The police knew, the Italian police were notified that I am going because I wanted a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">This he didn’t give me, but he said he notified the [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , was that we come to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , they would take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They never did, it was just a story, nobody did anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But our relatives arranged our return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So part of us went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Another <span class="NPIP">part</span> , four of our colleagues were not allowed, were not permitted again, had to go back the same -- same through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Even though they had the same passports like we did [indecipherable] all valid passports, Romanian passports, Romanian citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So [indecipherable] of these friends, all of them perished during the war, in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We don’t know exactly what happened to them, maybe it was the partisans or whatever where they ended up on their own, were killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> during the war by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , we were supposed to go to our families when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , but we were arrested immediately at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> sec -- security and stayed there for a week or 10 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Our relatives tried to get in touch, we couldn’t get in touch with our relatives, and the didn’t know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They kept us there for a week or 10 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They wanted to send us -- in that time there was a camp of the Iron Guard, it was still -- there were some in the -- in -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They wanted to send us for political prisoners, but finally they decided to send us to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukavina</span> , which was -- in that time people could walk over from [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There was an agreement between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and so many were sent over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And so I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and I stayed there from ’40 to °41, worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">central hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> .</span></p>
