<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Can you tell us your name and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is and they used to call us Willy or Wilek. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Loew was L-O- W, but when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> it was changed to L-O-E-W. So the name actually here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is William Loew, but my friends back at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they remember me as Wilek. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Lemberg is basically a German name for Louve and my parents came from probably <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I'm not quite sure, but from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and we settled down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">That was <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> at the time and also known as a Austria Hungarian empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The time in the when I was born I had basically a nice family, a wonderful family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Let me speak about my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I had an older brother we used to call Eli. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">The oldest one was Abe. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We had a very close family. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My mother was very -- was a housewife but also dealing in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Our business was we had a <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> a <span class="BUILDING">mead brewery</span> which is a honey wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">The business was quite prosperous. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">For one thing, our business has been derived from previous generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We started, but not my father but my grandfather and my uncles they started in 1870. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">As a matter of fact I still have one of the labels of our original wines which is a honey wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Our family was approximately 80 persons strong counting my uncles, my grandfathers from either <span class="NPIP">side</span> , my mother's and my father's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We were more numerous on my father's side than on my mother's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My mother's maiden name was Margulies and some of her brothers went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">At that time in 1932, 1933 and the remainder stayed there in at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We stayed and we tried to continue our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My father died when I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He died probably 1929 so my mother actually took over the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I don't think she was a good business woman from what I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The business continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had my oldest brother could not get into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he had to move out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So, he studied there. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">This was expensive to study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because the money that we had from the business was not that prosperous. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I'm not quite sure the reason for it but I think that my mother wasn't as aggressive in the business as she should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So, if I recall sometime in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and we were no longer in the business of honey wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But my uncles they continued to be in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">At that time in that previous years, we used to export our wine to different areas of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that we know and also to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> was the best that can be said back in '37 '38 from what I can recall was lukewarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It wasn't very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It wasn't very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We did have our quotas going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a matter of fact when I went for my exam to enter the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> even though the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> was ten blocks away from me, I couldn't get in because I had a quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I passed I understand my entry exam, but I couldn't get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">That was back in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So, in order to continue my studies I had to move on somewhere else and I had to go to another <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> back on <span class="DLF">Louve on Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was known as the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Going back to '38, '38 was a fairly peaceful years for our family but it was a hardship because we couldn't meet the loans that my father apparently incurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So, things were difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My oldest brother Abe who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , he finished his master's degree and he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's collection of oral testimonies. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">tried to stabilize, because he was basically the oldest in our family, he tried to stabilize the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his own good. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to love each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year old boys used to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Abe on the other hand was much older that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He was older than I by ten years so he was more a Serious person and he had very little in common with us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were quite a few refugees who would be coming from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> especially those Jews who were exiled from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and somehow they didn't stay long enough in the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they kept on moving and settled down in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">This was in '39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they came the German Jews in thousands and settled down in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  What year were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Did you work in the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our enterprise, or the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> , wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The only time I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> 1s to see the process of making wine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists in the winemakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They were there, of course, I recall we had a <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> that took <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> a whole <span class="DLF">block</span> because that whole <span class="DLF">block</span> used to belong to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Underneath in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> under the whole <span class="DLF">block</span> was the whole winery. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I recall that barrels where the wine was stored for aging was stacked four or five barrels stacked high. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They were smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but I recall they were maybe 35 gallons. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">This was the standard barrel at that time to age honey wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma contributed from the honey it was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and I don't know who took over our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It could have been that my uncles had took it over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  You lost your father when you were four years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Do you remember him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He had a beautiful flag, eight or nine <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was designated for a certain purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Beside the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> we had what we used to call <span class="BUILDING">salon</span> which is a large <span class="REGION">area</span> and we had a special <span class="BUILDING">reception place</span> for certain events or for our friends of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So, we had a fairly large flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My grandfather who actually brought The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence"

Holocaust Memorial Museum's collection of oral testimonies. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">me up because I lost my father when I was four, he used to live with us and my aunt Miriam she was a sister of my mother and we stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That was my family, the immediate family. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my aunt Miriam and my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My grandfather brought me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He was in a way a philosopher on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He was a self taught mathematician. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He was a true philosopher. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Not only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own mind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He would get up in the morning four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I knew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Whenever he woke up he would start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any coughing any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So, he did traditional things with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He would get up and go to our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We used to call it a . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He would stay there until from four to seven, seven thirty and by that time he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and wake us up and go and prepare ourselves to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My grandfather, he was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He actually prepared me for my bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of course other languages like Polish and Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But his special language was Hebrew and German. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">By profession he was a printer. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">He came from which is south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister, but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's side that they live in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He had a good life what I recalled even though it was difficult from a national point of view, but it was close. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We were one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We had a good rapport and a good relationship with our uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The other <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> in that was right across our <span class="DLF">street</span> so we had a major <span class="DLF">industrial park</span> if you will of <span class="BUILDING">breweries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was the <span class="BUILDING">Isaac Brewery</span> and there was the <span class="BUILDING">Brewery</span> and then there was a <span class="BUILDING">Brewery</span> and we were all together in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I recall the way we were distributing our wine to different <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and horses and we would be delivering wine so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I used to like to go to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and every so often just to be together with the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So, the whole where we used to live, we used to live on which is a normal whole <span class="DLF">block</span> that compares with any <span class="DLF">block</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it was all one <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We were sort of like a corner <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was a three story corner <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that borders on and . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That was the main <span class="DLF">road</span> in the Louve that carried on for a number of miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The is sort of almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , an <span class="REGION">area</span> where Jews used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was a dominant <span class="REGION">area</span> for Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It had many <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In all, the Jewish people used to congregate right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but there are basically, it was the majority in . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The minority in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There were more Ukrainians in our <span class="REGION">area</span> than there were Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">This is not to say that this was typical for In our <span class="REGION">area</span> it was typical. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The main activity in was on Friday where all the peasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We had a farmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The potatoes for winter time. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The cabbages, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Of course, we were doing also business at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They were also The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's collection of oral testimonies. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">purchasing wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">It wasn't a trade off. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was just a matter you would be buying for a certain period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but for the groceries she would go to a special <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where it would specialize in Jewish food. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was a vibrant <span class="REGION">area</span> for Jews to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was very interesting and when the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's market</span> was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would see everything was depleted. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The whole <span class="REGION">area</span> was quiet because Friday night we would be going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , so the <span class="REGION">area</span> was depleted. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was still kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So the whole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much quieter. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Although the Jewish life continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When the life in those days and I'm saying '38 and '39 was quite active it was also troublesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Because we wouldn't be completely free of any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The rumors were obviously of what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what happened in some other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> although we knew very little of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> but there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that affected us automatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">There was a movement in Polish society to promote the anti-semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> and it was moving toward the end that we were worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We didn't know whether we had to take any action. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">In 1939 it was a year that we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I don't remember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where the was bombarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">All the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , one bomb hit our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">We were then in our <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , actually in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> was where the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> was, but we no longer had the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> but we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">A bomb hit just a part of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , just a part of it, but it was -- the damage was done not directly to our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in general, but the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> , for example, which were <span class="DLF">concrete staircases</span> , were they were marked and there were some splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was damage in it already. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">When we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> we had some other friends and some people were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while that I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We didn't see any fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Nothing was really down other than one <span class="NPIP">portion</span> was hit and there were some other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were attached to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we checked that and I remember my brother said well, there's not much damage to our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So, that I recall that we were hit by a bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the beginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided into two major areas with the lights somewhere west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> and the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">This was a new era that we began. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The Russians occupied the eastern part of and was part of that <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I recall when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were rolling down from coming from and they were huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and apparently they didn't have to fight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">If they were they were somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So, there was no conquest to be bragged about. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They kept on moving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not changed other than that in the next few weeks there was a proclamation of I think it was in a few weeks that all the major <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> were confiscated and we had a The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="179">new regime and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">This was the Soviet territory. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So that means that our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> no longer belonged to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because this was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with money for the loans we had incurred some years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So, that was a relief in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The big question was how do you make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My mother didn't see how her facial with the army showed that she was concerned about those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Eli was basically two years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to find himself, and he tried different approaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He didn't feel like going to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He never cared for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">My older brother Abe was concerned because he was one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the intelligencias for reasons that I don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They would put them in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> which was on -- I recall that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> being called . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Whether they were arrested or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">During that period of time, 1939 and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as Eli. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I continued to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> until that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The subjects my studies were now basically new. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">First of all since Jewish -- this was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> , we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">That was a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with the Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">My mother also makes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">She used to, back in '39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I was better in English than I was in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">That's how I picked up some of my English language. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> we picked up two more languages and I was quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew alphabet. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">In the Russian language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware of that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that we picked up two more languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The life under the Russians don't have too many bad recollections other than that during that period of time more since <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided into two <span class="REGION">areas</span> , the <span class="REGION">German area</span> which 1s the <span class="DLF">line</span> , quite a few refugees were coming more so from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Of course the Germans occupied the <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> so they were directly under the German authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And Jews were fleeing from that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I recall that in my class in we received at least three German students one was from , one was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , two were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and one from . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And there was another fellow who was also a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I don't know he escaped probably from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but not <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He was from the Bohemia part that was occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">He escaped into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and then to the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He came to us to the <span class="REGION">Russian occupied part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">In all, they were very jolly fellows. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I was 14 or 15 at that time and of course the fellows from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> they tried to speak either Polish or Russian and they had a horrible accent and they just couldn't get through because their Russian language and the German language they just don't put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They used to pronounce things in German that the pronunciation it was funny for us to listen to them, but the were wonderful fellows, very, very good boys.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  No, they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family escaped <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so there were no problems with the family and they hardly spoke about any events that involved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They were boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They were my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They were more interested in soccer games. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They were more interested in learning the language, how to deal with us because we were actually and they were the Germans so we were basically -- they were not even of Jewish nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We knew the Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We knew the laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They were not that much involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They didn't care about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We were not frightened to bring them into our way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They had their way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So, they did not mention anything of their event. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">The refugees who were coming in more and more from the <span class="REGION">western part</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we felt that we better slowly but surely being overwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was just bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They were claiming that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> are being established. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We thought in because we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't have the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , but these were true persecutions they were telling us. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We didn't understand what a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> means. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It wasn't a part that he would accept that, it just wasn't acceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We didn't know what people would do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> let alone the establishment and how do you so things people ignored that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But as they were coming, more by thousands, the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> that we used to have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we have opened up, the <span class="INT_SPACE">salon</span> and the special <span class="INT_SPACE">section room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We gave it up for them to dwell on it, to live in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We had a large <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we offered them everything we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Some of them took to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Some of them moved out on their own, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who came who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left some other people back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> wherever their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">There was quite a few from , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> from -- I don't recall the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It was the Russians came in and they forced themselves into our <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they basically took all of these refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That was traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major expulsion of the refugees from to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And we befriended some people there, so we were not far away from the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I run into that, and they put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and they were locked up over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">That's how they were going to transport them from to east to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">We couldn't do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I knew they were crying, really crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">What did they do wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">These were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They didn't kill them, but they put them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We found out later that they were sent to and to different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I never met them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Life in continued after that expulsion until another war broke out and that was in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Can we stop for a second? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">End of Tape #1 The following transcript is the result

ANSWER:  So when the Germans occupied there was a part that we didn't-when I saw we, I'm talking about the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">The family, my mother or my brothers and I was just a boy listening to what's happening, what surrounds us. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We were concerned yet there wasn't much that we could have done even though that it would be an immediate danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Our immediate danger would have been from the local people that we would be threatened by. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">As I mentioned before we lived in , which the majority of people were actually Jewish people, but also the minority were the Ukrainians and Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We were not quite sure how to take it, what really happened, although we heard a lot that the Germans are very threatening people. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We soon found out that the first few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> after the German occupation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> , there were quite a few robberies and personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Some of them were maybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It was very dangerous to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow the Jews to walk after certain hours, evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That was maybe just as good, but the problem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main robberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It was the night first 1:00, then 2:00, then 3:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They would rush into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and if they couldn't find anything, they would destroy or maim people. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Only during the night could you hear the night cries, the night help rescue, seeking help. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">This was horrible right during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we were basically safe because on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> we had a tenant that used to live and apparently he was a . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He was half German and half Polish, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They occupied that level and they actually controlled the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , not that he would help us directly but people know that somebody's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we were basically protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But you could hear at night the horrible screams being robbed and maimed and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better because every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point and I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the <span class="REGION">premises</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , where we used to live, and move into a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that was . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">To find a <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> and to move out, and we didn't have that much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , the paintings, the rugs that we had, some of that Snyder took in his possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">All the beautiful paintings my father bought in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and the rugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It's immaterial now, but at that time it meant a lot to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, we moved out with a basic one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> and some of the belongings that we had from the whole <span class="BUILDING">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was my mother, myself, I'm not sure if Eli was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">My oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He was taken away just before we moved out to that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">He apparently went to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to get some medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">He never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He had to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> to where later on it became the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It seems to me it was close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He went there and he never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We didn't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We heard that later on one <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was emptied by Gestapo or by people who worked with the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They took them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I'm not quite sure when was established. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">wasn't even at that time a bad word. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But we heard . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">1S an <span class="REGION">area</span> where Jews were killed and it was adjacent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But we heard that word . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So, he was not with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Eli was in and out of our <span class="REGION">area</span> , The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The recording is the

class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Not quite sure what he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I'm sure he was trying to survive, trying to find some angles to get out of a bad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">We moved out to that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">A secretary to our business who used to be our secretary, she used to live in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in a free standing <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she offered her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I don't know the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an <span class="REGION">area</span> because you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one <span class="REGION">area</span> to another <span class="REGION">area</span> where you have a comparable exchange of <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It wa questionable, but we had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">With our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in that free standing <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I recall there were maybe three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> perhaps and there was another family that moved in with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Now, it was a period of time that we acclimated ourselves into this new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The faces that we didn't know before all of a sudden we knew them very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They were all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The way I understand that a Jewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We were not much concerned with them, other than there was another <span class="REGION">area</span> that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We all of a sudden have a new life in a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , new people, new surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">The future, who knows what it's going to bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The rumors were actually in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you better have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that will help you survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the point where you had to survive somehow not knowing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or anything of that that we are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">That didn't grasp yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We weren't involved in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We were involved mostly 1n our personal belonging, in our personal lifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> didn't mean to us that this was the end of our <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">It was perhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You were not directly confronted with the physical abuse, the physical maiming of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">The rumors were you better get work. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">That was in '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I was 16 years old, and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Where do you find work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I run across a friend of mine who told me that there is a place on <span class="DLF">Street</span> who -- and they called it that they're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I didn't know what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I went back to my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for some workers and whether she would allow me to go interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">My mother didn't think that she objected other than she warned me be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I went to . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">They called it later on . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">isa <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that made tar paper for the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> and the way they were doing 1s you roll out a three foot section of paper and you dunk it into asphalt. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Later you roll it out and there are some people who were using dry sand and covering the wet asphalt and that becomes a tar paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">What they were looking for workers who could carry balls of paper 75 to 80 kilos of paper to go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , say from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> that they had right in the back, or <span class="NPIP">storage place</span> , and I wasn't sure that I could do that, but if that meant to have an 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">and be protected I better do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and told them that I would like this work if they could have me. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">There was man called Fessel. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He was a Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slazia</span> , it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and he looked at me and close to him there was a

ball, 75 kilos. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Every ball was numbered and I picked it up and I carried it and I dropped it the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he wanted me to drop it and he hired me on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You can work with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It was basically not a relief for me other than that I felt that I'm employable. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> told my mom that I have a job and maybe we'll be more secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working every day with them going back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to or . </span><span class="sentence"

would be coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> I used to work,

blank a certain period of time that I cannot recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The image that comes to my mind now is August the action. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We called it , Where that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in was basically almost evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Practically all the Jews were taken and I was at that time in , was located on <span class="DLF">Z6tkiewska Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The main <span class="DLF">entrance</span> was from which was the main thorough between north and south. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And it was the <span class="REGION">area</span> which would be within a couple blocks of where my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> used to be, a couple blocks from my uncle's it used to be and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">There was a time I recall when the action came about in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and it was close to evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Somebody rushed into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> one of our workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They were moving them out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We moved out, I moved out immediately to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to see what we wanted to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We saw what we didn't want to see, thousands and thousands of ghetto people were moving and going to <span class="DLF">Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I looked and I saw some of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">My friends, dear friends that I used to play with. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Some acquaintances. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I was looking for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I didn't see her, didn't find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It was maybe twenty rows and miles of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They were slowly marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">They were guarded by Ukrainian . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I didn't see any Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Maybe in the back, but I didn't see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Mostly Ukrainian on each <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I didn't see the front either. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I came right in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I didn't see the beginning the march, I didn't see the end of the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I just kept on seeing the <span class="REGION">area</span> where it was visible to me from that narrow <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They didn't see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I saw them because the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was actually locked, the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It was going on for hours and hours because there was a slow march. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Finally it ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">People were looking from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> because all was inhabited by Ukrainians and Poles, second third stories, they're all looking at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was a very grim sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I don't recall -- it was the following day that I decided to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Although they warned me not to go, they I mean Fessel and the director of the <span

class="sentence" id="422">I don't recall whether I had to wear a band or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I probably did, but I don't recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because I wanted to see what happened to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I rushed into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was empty but the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> where we had the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for my mother was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> consisted of a frame and on top of the frame there was this soft

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> , the upper part was one unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">That's why when there was any action, my mother would be hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I would make sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">When I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the <span class="REGION">upper part</span> was moved so I

wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So even though they were looking for her, they didn't find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">She was there, so we had our moment, with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">A number of weeks went by before another action came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I think during

QUESTION:  Can I ask you something before we get to the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  What happened to your grandfather and Miriam?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  My grandfather died during the Russian time. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He died -- I don't recall but it was during the Russian occupation and he was buried in a <span class="DLF">grave yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We felt that this was a very timely death for my grandfather to die, not to see everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But it was definitely during the Russian occupation that we were not harassed at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Aunt Miriam she stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Aunt Miriam did not have a good rapport with my mother, but at the time of that bad time, they changed their minds or they have relaxed their anger or whatever it was, they were back together, at least on a talking basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">If I recall, she moved with us to the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">At what point she was taken I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But I don't recall her that much although I really liked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">She was one of the intellegencias, but she was a strange person to many eyes, but not to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I was her favorite, but what happened to her, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Whether she was taken, the action I don't know because from there on I did not see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I don't recall where she went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Tell me something about Eli and your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Were you angry at him for not sticking with your mother at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Eli was very special to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He was 17, 18 at that time and he had his own friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He had many girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">He always looking for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">He needed money. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I was more of a family son. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I was closer to my mother and assuring that everything was under control and Eli was not the opposite of me and he wasn't completely with me as I would like him to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Abe was completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">He was much older than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He was ten years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">He had his own friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He had very little to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He would want to talk to me other than in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He despised Polish language, so he would only speak Hebrew to me, and I had to respond to him also in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Although my Hebrew wasn't that good, but I carried on a conversation with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">It was something that I wanted to impress my brother Abe at one point in time there was a Serbian or Yugoslavian king or Rumanian king that abdicated sometime in 1938 and I tried to tell him this in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I don't know whether he responded to me, but this was the time I recall an event that I tried The following transcript is the result of a

found in the catalog record. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">to impress and I wanted his assurance. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Abe was a little bit on the snobbish side because he was always with his friends talking about zionism, talking about the world's affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He tried to settle all the world's affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Eli was completely different from both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He was more or like a happy go lucky fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He wanted to live now not tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Now is the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Since he didn't have that much, he would take certain things from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and sell it to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I wasn't angry with him, but I tried to preserve things that the family had. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He understood that very well, but he was my favorite brother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used to give me some secrets and at night he used to take me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we would be smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So, I kept things in secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He was very good natured, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He cared about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Now, Eli was taken away from us some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I really don't know when. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He was taken away from that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Now I heard that Eli was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We weren't sure that this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , but it was very fearsome <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">The fact that we heard that and people are being killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Even though that I heard that Eli 1s there, I felt always that when Eli is ina tight <span class="NPIP">spot</span> he always will get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">At least I hoped so. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">When established the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> , I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We were a crew of 40 Jews only men. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we felt was a very safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> at least for the time being. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Even it was safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we had within the 40 people there were certain groups that were more confined with each other than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Probably psychologists would love to study those groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I was basically with a group of boys my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do we get some cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">That was the main thing at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">There was nothing that I can do any more in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I didn't want to go anymore there. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">As a matter of fact 1t was a Jew free area. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">The only thing that was dominant was actually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown ghetto</span> on Street and <span class="DLF">Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">That was the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I did not know too much about things that surrounded us because we were confined in a given <span class="REGION">area</span> and the only thing that we heard was the rumors that would come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Even papers didn't come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We didn't have any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So, the 40 Jews, even though we were together, they had such secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I didn't know what the secrets were. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I learned later on apparently they built an extra <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">There was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where we used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">On top there was the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> and in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> they erected a <span class="DLF">wall</span> which was done sometime probably before the action in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Nobody let me know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So, a lot of things -- in a way I was a little angry that they didn't let me know that because I could have brought in my mother, into the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It was a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It was a whole <span class="DLF">wall</span> and in that false <span class="DLF">wall</span> , false partition, it was covered with wood, piles of cut wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00 they would remove the wood and people would walk out for fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Even at that time I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I found that out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">When I was living in time where maybe I was too ambivalent, to naive of knowing what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But, they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Families of some of these 40 people and when I learned later on that there is a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and I just hoped that Eli would be alive so I could bring him here. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">My work at that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> consisted of working first with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bales</span> , carrying the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bales</span> and sometimes just dusting the asphalt with the dry sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">But then later on since I liked so much horses, we had a <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="554">His name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And he selected me to be his helper to care for the horses and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I really enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I'd rather work with horses than work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">The

ANSWER:  So we used to bring the asphalt back to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and of course in the process of asphalt being liquified later on in huge ovens and that's how we get the process of that tar onto the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">That was my work in , working with day in and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We were able to drive from our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to maybe two or three different <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and of course at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> , that <span class="REGION">area</span> any way, was already Jew free. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">There were no Jews there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Perhaps some were hidden, but there were no visible Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was basically very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It wasn't vibrant as it used to be the times that I recall back in '38 and '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">We were doing this a number of months and Peter and I we were very much befriended. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We were talking about at times that it could happen that one of these days they will take me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">The discussion was how do I survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">How do I get out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I did not have good moves ahead of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I did not see too many visions, what is a good way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">In back of our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> there were <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and those <span class="DLF">tracks</span> you could see every so often Hungarian troops going somewhere and the thought that came to my mind, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some Hungarian language and just jumped in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and said hey, I'm one of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But it was just a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Back with Peter, I told Peter what's a good way of surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He didn't give me a good answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">One day he came and told me, you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I thanked him for the offer or his thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">We had a farmer that would deliver some produce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">He looked me up in , and he told me that if you need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> come to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So, in that preparation I was very glad that he offered me a

do that at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So, he came back, and he looked me up and he offered me, I had hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">There's a <span

a lady that was limping that was going to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I said yes I see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I remember her.

give you an address that in case something happens here, you go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Because he felt at that time that the director Fessel is grooming her or grooming this <span class="NPIP">place</span> for him to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I took this as a good omen and I felt maybe he's got something there. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">It was a certain time within that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It was just before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> that it was in April sometime that I remember that two partisans -- a partisan is a person who's a guerrilla warrior. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They used to belong to a Polish underground, and they spoke to our leadership in

tighter and tighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Very few Jews you could see being escorted on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , less and less because until that time you see a group

didn't have anyone there. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Maybe I would be going with a friend of mine because he wanted to accompany, but I recall everytime I would be going there, I wouldn't be going there too often, but I was given an armband with a W letter which was for meaning that we were working for the , the army, even though that manager of our <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="663">A reasonable human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">He had an excellent rapport with Fessel. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">He was I think

that we were about to be picked up by the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">We would move out. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">The way I dressed myself -- I was dressed myself as a

and prominent the <span class="REGION">area</span> when we used to be young boys and free of troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">It was like three or four o'clock or two o'clock, something right afternoon that I ran off from and there was very little you could do downtown other than be picked up by Ukrainians or somebody who recognized me. </span><span class="sentence"

id="684">This was where the Germans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The Russians claimed that the Germans killed them. </span><span

<span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with only 40 Jews was a paradise from what I have seen over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">People were living in the <span

to live on the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , she was a daughter of a grocer. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">A very pretty young lady, she was probably in her 30s, I think.

class="sentence" id="710">She was my neighbor, and she gave me some slotties and I left went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another friends, the same surroundings, and I walked into an <span class="REGION">area</span> where some older young men were looking for how do you get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">How do you join the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And I was right in the midst of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">On suggestion was we get a whole group with the armbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort that group all the way down all the way down because nobody is going to ask where are you going with this Jewish group. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">That was one of the questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">The other question is where do you the uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Where do you get the arms, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It was a round robin exercise, how to you survive yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">The following day I got word that we are safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">In other words I could go back to and resume my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I went back to and resumed the work, but now I felt very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">It's only time before things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">There was another major action sometime later, I forget when in '43, whether it was June or July, a major action and I was told that Eli was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">He returned that he knew about me and during the action this was on that day someone else was going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> also because of action, rescuing someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I said I want to go with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I went and I took an extra armband for Eli just in case I catch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I went over there and they told me the address and I went to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there was a lady there, an empty <span

late. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I was downhearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">There was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that very few people should be going through this exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">As I was walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there was one <span class="DLF">fence</span> there and I hear right on the other side of the

were talking now about the liquidation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I don't recall when they had liquidated the <span

thinking more and more about this lady, the limping lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Peter gave me that address and he told me exactly how to go there to get to that <span

brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">His brother was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">He had a German overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It was Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got in there probably through a different route, but the route that I know how Fessel got into this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his personal secretary in . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So at least two people from our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , his brother which I never saw him before, his lady friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">That lady friend was a sister of that other couple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he came about there. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So we had like seven people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">It was a time where they were concerned about their security because of Peter. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">The question was whether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell him no one was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So, I could go and apparently go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to their <span class="NPIP">place</span> to secure their <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put me in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number of miles to his <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was more of a friend of mine than of theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">They left it at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So, now I was not one of them, but at least I was in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the time being. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">The <span class="REGION">area</span> we were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I think maybe it was another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but basically I was in the front in the large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was together with this hiding family. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We had a <span class="DLF">trap door</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> which was not in the <span class="NPIP">walking place</span> but in a <span class="INT_SPACE">crawling space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">We had a special <span class="REGION">area</span> that was covered with a rock in case something happens we all go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and hide ourself there. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">We had our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Apparently Fessel had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently paying also Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I didn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So, I thought things were taken care of by Fessel. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">The other couple they also were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> , I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names because they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort of in a group relationship, you were strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Maybe you had one thing in common, we are all Jews and we want to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">There was one thing in common but different interests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">So, the dynamics of our group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I could take part of some of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">There was a point in time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> is being liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">The rumors were also that the Russian army is moving toward <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">They weren't talking about immediate occupation or immediate conquer of the <span class="REGION">territory</span> but it was close enough that you need to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Whether to stay in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> or to move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I did not take any part of the decision because my action was always to stay in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So that wasn't an option that would be denied to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">The other option was whether or not to escape Louve all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">There was a young couple who would be coming and in keeping 1n touch with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">They had Gentile papers and they had excellent Gentile features and they would be the ones with whom we had contact with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They would know how to prepare the papers, Gentile papers and how we could be rescued. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Now the question was should they take me into the rescue effort moving out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">The recording is the primary source document, not

class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">The question was they're going to be moving out, should they take me with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I confronted that part with Fessel and I told Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I would like to be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I could always stay here, but I want to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">This is a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I don't want to be here, even in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He said well, we'll have to see what our resources are. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">We'll have to see if we can give you some papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He apparently was good enough to do that for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I was told that their plan is to escape ultimately to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> to from to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mountains</span> , through <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">That's the plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I walked with them all the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I'll go with you anyplace you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I felt that I could be of help to them if they needed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">The time came sometime in the early part of December I think, maybe it was in December, that we got our papers, the Gentile papers with our photographs and the stamps and the my name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I took the name of an acquaintance of mine from . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He was a very nice fellow and I thought he ought to have my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So, from there on, my name was from then on until my liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">My religion was catholic, and everything else was true on those papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">My birth and where I was born, and everything else except my name and my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">From there on, there was at night prior to that by the way that was something very interesting happened that I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">You know when you are in hiding for so many months you don't know how to purchase things. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">How to deal with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> although we are informed by Marie where things are, how to get to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , because now we have to move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> , buy a ticket, and these are small items but very crucial items. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , buy a ticket, go into the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , buy a ticket and go to . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Finding the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and maybe a reservation for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">That we did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Maria was not about to buy any tickets for us, so they asked me whether I could go on an exercise to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , look around, see where the purchase ticket box 1s, see if there is anything unusual and go buy the tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Well, I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">One night they left me and I had to go from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> at night walking through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , through the barracks of the militia and there is a small <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I got to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and I got to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and to see where I could buy tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I went to the main

QUESTION:  Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">ANSWER:  I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I never asked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">The only thing that I could stipulate was that she was prearranged prior to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">The fact that I saw her one day in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> walking towards the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that means she was prearranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">She was given I'm almost sure that she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I know other things that during my stay in the hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that was the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with Fessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always be the winner on that evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game was over, he would be coming out with money. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">He knew about us obviously, so he was paid that way through winning in this game. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Other than that, I don't have any other facts, but Maria a person of no wealth. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">She had this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she was with Usak who told me where she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what was the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of human compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Maybe it was a combination of both.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  Was this a very lonely time for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  It wasn't lonely because I was always active. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I was very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">My mind was always going regardless what was going -- what surrounded me. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">My question was to myself how do you get out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I was fierce about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I was driven by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">How do you get out and stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Because I felt that I had to say something later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Maybe this is why I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had to say it, to say that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So lonely, no I wasn't lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I was too dynamic to be lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So, when they saw me coming back from that <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and they greeted me with enthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our things whatever I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I don't think I had anything with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I just had just my hat, my jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">We went through the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , got our ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">There was a direct <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">It was all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">We went through over night and the following day we were already in . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">We were picked up by the smugglers. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Now, let me back off just a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">That couple who used to come who had their connection from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , brought the papers for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">That couple that I forget their name, were left behind because that's what they chose, to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">All of us left, including the lady friend of Fessel's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">By the way, she was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">She was big and my estimation was that she was in the eighth month of pregnancy, but she was walking and she was also determined to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and got picked up later on in by the smugglers who were previously arranged by this couple who gave us all the false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">We went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I forgot this <span class="REGION">area</span> at the time where it was that they took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I remember that we had our lunch with Polish kielbasa. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We had a piece of bread and that evening or that night, we were going to move out of . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Because everything else was prearranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">It was sometime December or it was early part of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I don't know that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It was 1944, January or 1944 or December 1943 but very close to that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I want to say that I am close right on The following

we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> close to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra Mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">It was basically a <span class="BUILDING">ski resort</span> and we departed from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">We picked up and we kept on walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">It was an <span class="REGION">area</span> probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">By the way, this <span class="REGION">area</span> was strictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and border police. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">The smugglers were actually Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I forget their name. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I forget even their faces but we got through and we kept on walking through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">The episode that I recall was walking in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">It was so called and also the snow was very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">The surface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into a trap because you couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">It was a very difficult walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Now, the lady who was pregnant she had a horrible time walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">At least I had boots but I don't recall 1f she had boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that mode. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I was strong and I tried to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I did help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I kept on walking with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and embracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">At one point in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to help her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they wouldn't survive the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">I couldn't leave her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I had to walk with her and I walked her and a long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Such a shame, but we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">We went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra mountains</span> and got into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">At least we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">We were so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">They took us into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified ourselves as refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so we were all Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">So, from this <span class="REGION">police area</span> I think they took us into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I don't recall how long we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">There was another couple from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , independently they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">They were refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">One was a professor I think, a Polish professor with his wife, and some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">At that point they took a picture of us that I had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">The object has to move from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> now to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and within a few days I think we were moved from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> which I have a hard time remembering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">It was comes to my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Maybe I'm wrong but was the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">There were some Jews -- see <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that point in time was not occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">It was the early part in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">If I recall well, when I was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later part of January but not the early part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">We were brought in and and there was a Jewish couple that took us in for that evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">It was a Friday I think and the reason I remember was because there was shobotz and they offered us A is a meal a Jewish meal with beans and chicken and carrots and all that good stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">It was very good, very tasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">This was the first time I was exposed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I was very grateful for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">The following few days from because we wanted to g into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and that was our goal because from there on Fessel had his plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I had my plans so once I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> which we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> within a week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I don't remember that period very well, but I remember that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and the question was we were not

</span><span class="sentence" id="1054">The same problem, where do you run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">One thought was to run to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">The way you could get to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> was through <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">The other thought was to run to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , means you had to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Which route do you explore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">You explore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I felt to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> would be a good deal to do, but to go you had to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">That was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">A better way is to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I had friends that became my friends that were in the underground movement and I joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Some of these people were mostly Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Some Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going to run somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the Polish underground which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be comfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Even that group, I have some Polish members. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Seven people, we had seven people in our <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I wasn't given orders to carry out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Basically I was a courier for them, transferring papers from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , mainly from Buddha to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to Buddha and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">At one time I had to go outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but this was a short trip and I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">One time I had to carry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I'm doing something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers, false birth certificate, false statements of good standing of a given community and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Church papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Not specifically for Polish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">We were all saved so called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">The question now is how do you help out the Hungarian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They needed the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">They did not have the flexibilities that we did have because we were right <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">There was a time that they were mostly almost confined to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">house ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">They already had the stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">They had to carry, we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">We were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I happened to get myself with the underground and they advised me to have two or three residents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , having a place to live in Buddha, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pess</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buddha</span> I had to <span class="NPIP">places</span> where to live and when I chose a <span

I feel at time whenever there was a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , there was always a heart beat, an extra heart beat that I have developed later on in my life because somebody is knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> at the wrong time and maybe for the right purpose or for the wrong reason as far as I am concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">So, there were time when they were raiding some <span class="REGION">areas</span> , but this was in <span class="REGION">Gentile areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I never lived with Jewish

<p><span class="sentence" id="1152">ANSWER:  Yes, I was beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I was beaten terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">In other words they put a bar between your legs and then your whole body is folded downwards and you're beaten on your feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Of course on the buttocks and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">It was very painful, but I took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">It wasn't a big thing that I recall it was impossible not to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">They wanted to know again, what was the message that I was trying to deliver to <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being Jewish wasn't their concern apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I don't recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Whether they took it for granted one way or the other, I was never told. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">The main idea for them was to move me as soon as possible back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and they took me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and they put me in a political prison on . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">That was the <span class="BUILDING">political prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and I stayed there for a number of weeks or months almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I'm not quite sure how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">It was there that I met other some of my acquaintances from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I met who was the ambassador from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who spoke perfect Polish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I also met across the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> a lady name who later on I found out she was Hanna . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">She was very resourceful to convey her name one letter after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">There was a time probably that I recall because we were seeing at one point in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">It was a period when it was Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">It was a time that if I want to tag a point it was Yom Kippur 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">definitely was still alive because I corresponded with him later on after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I was interrogated almost daily because not only they wanted to know what was my message but the unfortunate thing was they found a picture in my possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">A fellow that I befriended in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , he was also a Jewish refugee but for some other reasons I befriended him and we were dating girls together and we had fun with him and he was in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">They caught him, so they wanted to know what was my association with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">So it was a complication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">I don't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I don't remember even his name but he was a very nice fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">He was a fellow that I would feel very comfortable to be a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Sometime later after 1944 I remember we were about to be ready to be moved out of this <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and we were told that they are going to send us to some kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">It must have been some time in October because I recall I got in, they brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and it was on my birthday, October 29, 1944 that we walked on that <span class="DLF">platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , from a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they brought us immediately to this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They tattooed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Now, my name was 193 229, no longer the name . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">There was no other names but my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">The time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I have very little memory of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I did work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I did get this uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I had the cap, with the stripe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Whether they gave me some wooden shoes I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Probably they did, maybe I did have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I did have it I think, I did have it, the wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I was one of the inmates now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I was in one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , surprised that I don't even remember the number of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> because you must remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Maybe I don't want to remember, but we were close to that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where there was a special <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where things were -- a <span class="BUILDING">punitive barrack</span> and I was told to stay away from it, that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Not much, I don't think that I was ever concerned about being gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">My only question was how do I get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1200">QUESTION:  You were not there as a Jewish prisoner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">ANSWER:  I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I'm not sure if I was a Jewish prisoner or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">It seems to me I was among Jews so I was a Jewish prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Until a given day that a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was empty and they The following transcript is

id="1211">I think it was a left position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Took me back into my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they look at my tattoo oh you're a , that's the word that I all of a sudden get to my mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or not a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what my status was because I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">One major event that I recall wa the hanging of five Polish prisoners who escaped <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">When they were brought back, they took out the whole camp to watch the hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">That was sometime probably in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">It was awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the morning when the hanging took place and after the hanging normal life proceeded in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Then again there's a <span class="DLF">gap</span> that I don't recall what was going on, just a matter of daily consumption of the stale bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">The bread came from the transports from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , but we were given stale bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">It was just at least it was something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">The food was very terrible, very thin soup, just water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">But I was not -- didn't feel that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I still felt that I could withstand the ordeals and whatever took place because they were talking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were moving in closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">As a matter of fact, our thought was that was already taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">Maybe it was a hope, maybe it was not, but anyway they were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">So, the recreation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was almost eminent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">January 5, comes to my mind but I'll stand corrected if it was something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">We were evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we walked a long time to another <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and I don't recall too well but we were put into open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> , only men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I hadn't seen any women, and they took us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">A horrible trip, a horrible trip, people were dying because of this cold exposure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I had frostbite on both feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me personally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I always felt that I could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I couldn't physically move things the way I used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">We were, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving through <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I know because I heard that and as we were going underneath the <span class="DLF">overpasses</span> , they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to us in the open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">It was a good omen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I had a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mine with whom I've been for since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , that's where I met him, he was with me all along in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">He survived by the way and he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

<span class="NPIP">place</span> that they had in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">We finally wound up in , why I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Just before we reached they were discarding all the bodies from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and people were most of them were that majority was alive and there were shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">It was a huge mountain of the corpses from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">It was molestation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">It was all guarded by the SS and their henchmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">We stayed there perhaps a few hours, they kept us back and we kept on going, and from there on they took us from to . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">We were told that when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> that we were a sore lot, and we were,
