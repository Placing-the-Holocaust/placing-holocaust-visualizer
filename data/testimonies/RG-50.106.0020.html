<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Were they Jewish groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Yes, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the same groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">See, it wasn’t -- each group was working something individually. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">See, they’re on their own because you have to be broken up in small -- you know, in the beginning -- eventually you can join one group. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So | didn't even know about this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So we met up with two other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">One group didn’t have -- they escaped some how, some way, maybe Joseph Elman 25 [date] Page 25 threatened (ph), or maybe some how, or maybe they were not exactly -- or maybe someone tell them they were hiding in a <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ‘til the liquidation finished and then they walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But they knew, they heard, you know, by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there were some parties out. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So somehow they reached. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So we met up with two other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So we're all together already at the time, consisted of about 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But the other groups -- the other group had very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Very few ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Now it’s important to say out who, the 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Now we were armed fully, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We had plenty in the contraband, but my brother -- of course | was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">It was secretly my parents didn't even know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So the <span

class="sentence" id="541">But you know, there was a lot of -- had to take it out and hide all this stuff, the contraband. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So we had to time our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But in the interview, when | was -- the hour struck, | think | mentioned, you know, when | was interviewed by the . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They wanted to know exactly how much. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So | think we had 11 rifles and we had a machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We had about four of each one -- you know, hand grenades, . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So it was pretty, pretty -- | didn't realized how strong, how much ammunition compared with some other groups, compared with some of the groups, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Even in the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which they had to fight so hard to pay so much money to get a pistol. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And then, you know, they called the Polish underground supports to give it to them and they'd even deliver to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">| went to, | think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zucherman</span> (ph) when | was in lodge (ph) <span class="BUILDING">Joseph Elman 26</span> [date] Page 26 at that time, because | was liberated 1944.
