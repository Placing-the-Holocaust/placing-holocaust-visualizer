<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Could you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Uh my name is Hanna Brum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , uh May 30th, 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Could you tell me something about your family, and growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was very fortunate because we lived with my grandmother and grandfather in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was the only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother had a child a year before me, but he died just before delivery. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So I was the first grandchild in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I...all my first memories are about my grandfather, and I feel very warmly about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He died when I...three months before my third birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But nevertheless, all my memories are about my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And we simply had a love affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Uh he would watch me to go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to buy his cigars. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">His cigars were "Virginki," which means that they were tobacco from <span class="COUNTRY">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Uh we called them "Virginki." </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And he watched me to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> and give my little money on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> , and bring him uh his cigars. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And he very proudly looked after me, that I was able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So at the very early childhood, he really pushed me to independence, to do things for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I remember he had a little wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> with a crack in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I loved peanuts, but I was very small to crack them. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So I put the peanuts in that little crack, and he gave me a mallet; and I would push the peanuts and I could have to open it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And these are memories that nobody could have really told me that uh about my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Or we went walking; and uh I even remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And he would give me a little coin; and I would go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and give my little penny on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> , and uh--whatever it was--and buy, you know, a little piece of candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And he waited for me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And uh his birthday was in March, and he died just shortly afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And I came to him to give him my little poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I had to learn little tiny poems for the family, for the members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">That was my gift for their birthdays--to learn a poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I went to tell it to him, and he already didn't respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think he had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I came out crying, because my grandmother...uh my grandfather didn't kiss me and he didn't say, "Thank you." </span><span class="sentence" id="33">That I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I don't remember the kind of a rejection, which I thought at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That I only remember loving things about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And my grandmother was with us all my growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She had her birthday five days before mine; so we celebrated, more or less, birthday together. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She always kept a piece of her cake for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She was the one who told me stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Uh I would crawl into her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and she would tell me a fairy tale I had heard about fifty-five times; but I wanted to hear it for the fifty-sixth time https://collections.ushmm.org from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Uh when I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she would cross the big <span class="DLF">street</span> to help me cross back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I was more concerned about her crossing safely, but she was concerned my crossing safely. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So it got a little complicated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But she was in many ways the mother on whom I patterned my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And she had in her...she had a very orderly <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , she had a bag with her white shroud; and she knew according to the Jewish religion this is how she would want to be buried, and wanted to be buried with my grandfather in the same <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">She never had a chance to use that shroud even though we sent it with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> [Czech: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But I knew that['s] what she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Uh that was a sort of a thing to do every Sunday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We would go to <span class="DLF">Grandfather's grave</span> , and we'd put little stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">That's a tradition--you put a little stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And if she was not able to go, I always put a little stone for her on my <span class="DLF">grandfather's grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And uh after the...after I returned I always...when I'm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> go, and go to my <span class="DLF">grandfather's grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And since we were not able to put her there, we had her...I had her name put on the same gravestone. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And my relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> are maintaining the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , even though many...even though so many are neglected. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And uh so she 1s there, at least in memoriam, as she wished to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  What, as you grew up, as you became a young woman, what was your schooling like? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">What were your friends like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  For the first five years I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It was more <span class="BUILDING">Zionistic Jewish school</span> , not a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We were twenty boys and ten girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Out of the ten girls, we were five Hannas--because it was a very popular name. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And out of the five girls, as far as...as far I can say, I'm the only one who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Out of the twenty boys, I know about five survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I am in contact with one of them; and just recently, he sent me a picture of the second and the fourth grade, which was a real find for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">After that, I went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> --which was the academic level. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And uh then I went into a <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> , and I started working and be very... I was always very, very independent, very, very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And my father led me to independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Uh, I--as an eleven, twelve year old, I went to collect from his...from the builders money, so he would have for his payroll. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And in the beginning they looked at this little girl who's coming to collect money, and would call my father: "Is that on the level?" </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I gave them a receipt, signed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He told them it's OK, because nobody had an idea that I was bringing payroll money. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So he was leading me, again, pretty much to independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Because my mother was uh a rather sickly woman who had frequent pneumonias, who have had at least uh five, six miscarriages after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I was the only live birth uh child. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So I was uh uh freely very much led to independence, almost compensating for her; because she was really very shy, very sickly and had enormously uh uh heavy thick glasses because she was so near-sighted. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Uh I was...my character was much more like my aunt--my mother's sister--and my father, who was much more outgoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  As you grew older, um you began to become involved with the young men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Uh I was...uh I was fortunate in my age we were still able to have some social life and go to <span class="BUILDING">dancing schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It's all, you know, with the long dress and uh formalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I was still about https://collections.ushmm.org the last year that['s] where we were able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And at that time, I was going with uh a student who was three years my age--so I was about sixteen, he was nineteen--by the name of Rudolph Schiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We called him "Rudla." </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And uh when I was seventeen, and uh the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were closing on us uh and uh...things were starting really getting bad, we got married November 14th, 1939, at the <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Again, there was no housing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the evening, because there was no possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In his uh...his families lived a couple of blocks away from us, so that was no big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And uh as uh the Germans were closing in, we had to go into more and more cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And his parents had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> what had it sub-divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And each <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was given to another family. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And uh the uh...so there was really no where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Then one of the families were sent with transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , so for couple of months we had one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">In the meantime, he got scarlet fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And at that time, when you had scarlet fever uh you had to go for six weeks into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Today, somebody with scarlet fever--it's [like] a strep throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">A couple of days, and you are fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They thought that you were infectious for six weeks, until your started to peel. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I had scarlet fever when I was in the first grade, so I knew what it meant for six weeks to be in isolation--which I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">By the way, I was in that isolation at children|'s] hospital; and the children['s] hospital was run by nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And the nuns said...came to us and uh said, "OK, children, get off your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , kneel and pray." </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I said to the nun, "I'm sorry, I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I don't kneel." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And so she said, "What are you going to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I said, "I'm going to pray in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> the way my grandmother taught me." </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I did not follow the party line, and in many ways the nuns respected that. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I was only seven--barely seven at that time, because I had my birthday in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And uh so he had scarlet fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; and while he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they brought in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> a little four year old--little Frankie. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Cute little Frankie. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The parents were Polish uh emigres who came to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ; and while he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they had to go with a transport and leaving the child in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They didn't allow them to wait until he was discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So my sister-in-law--my husband's sister, Margit--uh sort of adopted him and uh was to take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and while he was there she took care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But, of course, when she came with him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , she went to gas with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But when he...we had really difficulty during that time of all kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh during that time things were getting worse in terms of uh getting supplies, buying food, working, going places. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I remember going on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and meeting one of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Of course, by that time I had the star; and as we came closer to each other, we walked slower and slower, thinking, "Should I stop? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Should I talk? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Who was it worse for, her? </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Is it worse for me? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">What should we go and do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So... And so we slowly came together, looked at each other, winked at each other, and passed again. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It...1t was that sort of a situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You had to think, "Wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Is today Saturday? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Saturday, I cannot go this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Friday, I cannot get that <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Because the restrictions were getting tighter and tighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So it was a difficult time under any circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Uh, now Rudie--my husband--had a brother, Karel Schiff, who was finishing his MD degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">By that time, Hitler came. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And there were only two Jewish uh people who were supposed to get their degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You know, that big day in Europe--it was a much bigger day to get your degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Uh they gave the degree to everybody; and they took the two Jewish fellows to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and gave them their diploma in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And uh he had, as I https://collections.ushmm.org said, a sister and a brother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">None of them have returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Uh, my father-in-law died in the transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He died uh on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And my mother-in- law, was a very energetic woman, and brother-in-law were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">familienlager</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I was told how uh they knew what was going to happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Uh, Rudla was with them; and uh I understood he was quite sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And uh he died probably before he went to gas--in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">familienlager</span> , you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Let's go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Can you tell us a little more about the early years, of the German invasion, what that meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Uh, I remember the day they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I remember the day I sto... remember the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I stood, and it was snowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It was a cold day and they were pulling in - I was by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I just walked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It was not far, maybe three-quarters of a mile from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And we were uh uh watching them on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , with their half- tracks, with guns pointing to the <span class="DLF">rooftops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And it was snowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And we knew that the screw is going to become tighter and tighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh we knew what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But somehow we still had some foolish idea we are in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Because, I remember so clearly, when I was about eleven or twelve, I read a book about the Marranos. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">These were the uh Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> who during the Inquisition had a choice either to give up their religion or be uh converted [to] Catholicism; and many of them became converted only in name, and still celebrated secretly all the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And uh this was a very interesting story about the Inquisitor, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I remember--you know, the kind of vignettes one remembers from childhood--I remember telling my grandmother, "Aren't we fortunate that we live in the 20th century in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , that such a thing cannot happen to us!" </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Six short years, six short years [later, it] happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Not only as to them, but much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Uh, kind of took away from us the protection that 1t happens to somebody else but not to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">One becomes and realizes how vulnerable one is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  When did things begin to change--for your family, in particular? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">How did you... Describe some of it. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Uh, I worked at that time what they used to call a Palestina Amt [Ger: <span class="BUILDING">Palestine Office</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Uh, at that time there were still people able to move, uh emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And of course, when you signed your paper for emigration, if I was Hanna Schiff at that time, I had to sign it as "Hanna Sarah Schiff." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">All the women had to put down "Sarah," and all the men had to put in "<span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> " as a mid...as a middle name. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I was go...going to the Department of Treasury where I filled up some papers, and uh they had to pay that much of a... They had to give a list of all their property they were going to take with us in the suitcases, and they had to pay that much for this and that much for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And so I was working on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And therefore, I knew that the Jacob Edelstein was the head of the Palestina Amt, and knew some people there--which later became very important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Uh the...
