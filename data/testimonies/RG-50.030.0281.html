<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tell me your full name and tell me when and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My full name is Blanka Erma Rothschild. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Born Fischer. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , which is a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> considered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish manufacturing city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me when you were born, and then tell me a little bit about what your childhood was like before the war came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born in August of 1922. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was the only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My family was very close, well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I had a very happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I attended a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , and I had a lady at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> who took care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I had several cousins because my dad had several brothers and three sisters, and my mother had two brothers and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And each one of them had one or two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So we were a very close family, very devoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Something that I treasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My childhood gave me a very good background, strength, and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What did your parents do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  My father was -- he actually had two faculties. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He was an architect and an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He studied outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had very strict admission for Jews 1n their <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , so my grandparents sent him to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And he was mainly an engineer in his last years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  So around about -- well, tell me what you remember of the middle 1930s. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Do you remember changes happening and --
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Well, in the middle 1930s, I -- in the beginning of the 30s, I attended the <span class="BUILDING">German gymnasium</span> , which was the best in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But with the change in the political situation, my parents switched me to a <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And, unfortunately, I was sort of isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I didn't feel any pressure, any political pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Anything that was coming, I was unaware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had a group of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">In the summer, we were going away, and we had a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And it was quite a satisfactory life. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">However, in 1938 and '39, the changes started to occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We read about the rise of Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was neighboring <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We were aware of the speeches; however, we still felt pretty safe and secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My uncle, who was a physician, had many patients 01:04 who were of German origin, so-called Volksdeutsche then living in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And when he visited them, because at that time, a doctor visited patients in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they were wearing signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They were wearing swastikas in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There were pictures of Adolph Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And we still didn't take this too seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Seriously enough of thinking of leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  And then tell me what happened when the war started and how you remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  I remember distinctly September '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The Ist of September was the first day of war, and I remember there are certain moments that are crystallized in your memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They're etched so deeply, and I remember exactly the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I was sitting on a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , reading a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And all of sudden, I heard a thud, a tremendous thud sound, and I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> circling above the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I wasn't even afraid; I didn't know with what to associate this, that this was the day that the war started, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> came over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I did not know that they crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> at that moment, but I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and the thud. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And it startled me, and I got up and went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">This is something that 1s etched in my memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Did your parents talk? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Did you hear your parents talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Did they know what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Were they afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  My father died a year before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Two years before the war, excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Two years before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He suffered from uremia, and at that time, there was no cure for it then. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There were no dialysis known to medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I was with my mother, and my mother was being courted at the time by a friend, a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So they were rather happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The clouds of the war were sort of coming, but yet we did not realize to the fullest the seriousness of the situation of -- in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="BUILDING">lyceum</span> , which was equal to <span class="BUILDING">junior college</span> here, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And the radio started to play national Polish hymns and the patriotic speeches, and we were listening to people telling us that we were invincible, which was very laughable because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> did not have the technology that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> possessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">In a few days, the Germans went in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , which was not that far from the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And while Germans were coming with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , the Poles were fighting on their beautiful horses with lances, dressed beautifully. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Being patriotic and brought up in the spirit, everything was beautiful to me, but the reality of what was happening was ugly. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Very soon after that, the Germans started to issue laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Curfew was one of the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We were not permitted on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> past, I believe, 5 o'clock, I'm not too sure about that hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We were required to wear yellow stars with the sign Jude identifying us as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The money was frozen in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , and we started to be very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">One particular time, I was walking on a <span class="DLF">street</span> not too far from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I was called by a German officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He called me, motioning with his hand to come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My heart was beating wildly. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He asked me to go upstairs to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and being a young girl, I was just petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He asked me to clean the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He took his gun off, put it on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and was sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> next to it watching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Well, I didn't know too much about cleaning, but I cleaned very fast, and I did what he asked me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And he looked at me, and he said in German "It is a shame that you are a Jew," and he let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">This is another of the moments that I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">After that, I wasn't going out too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">My mother and my grandmother tried to shield me. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Since the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that we were living in belonged to -- this was a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which belonged to us, we knew many German people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , Polish people of German origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And my grandmother, who is very wise, asked one of them to come and be sort of a supervisor of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , so she made an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we did not have to display anything on the <span class="DLF">door</span> identifying us as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So for a little while, we were spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">However, pretty soon the Germans caught on. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">One day -- this is another of these moments -- one day there was a ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">An officer with an aide came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The officer had a scar on his face identifying him as a student who had dueled probably in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Germany University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He also had a black skull on his head, a skull which identified him, I think, as a member of SS, and we knew what that was, Gestapo SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He walked into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My grandmother, who was very fluent in German and knew that he represented danger, asked him if she could contribute to the German Red Cross, money. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She thought that she would mollify him and that he will leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">At which point, he hit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He had suede gloves, and he hit her with a gloved hand across the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He proceeded from <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a man and was pointing to things which struck his fancy, and the young man started to pack them. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">At the end of one of our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span> filled with fern greens, and there was a cage with a canary hanging there. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Once he saw the canary, his whole appearance changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He became enchanted with the bird, and he asked us "Is this a male or a female canary? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">How lovely does he sing." </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He was a changed man. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At that moment, I realized that a canary was more important, had more meaning to him than all of us human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">This is one of the moments that I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The man was an educated man; I knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And we were nothing, but the canary represented something wonderful to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">He was mesmerized by the canary, and he beat my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Well we were staying in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for some time until the Germans started to throw people out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I need to explain the term of "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> " to many people and children who are listening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is an isolated part of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> situated in what used to be a very poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and consisted of several blocks of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and small <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And we knew that we are going to be thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And since we knew somebody that was an engineer who was well acquainted with my family who lived at the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and he asked us, since he was being evacuated, if we could live in his little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and take care of it, which we agreed to greedily because it was clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It had three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And a <span class="DLF">garden</span> was very important because there was some food growing there and we moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">After a while, they started to send Czechish refugees, Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and they were being assigned <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was small; there was not much <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Well, we received a couple, a husband and wife -- a charming, lovely couple whose children were being kept by some Czechish neighbors, Christian people who helped to save the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And the couple stayed with us for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But we were being already used to the rations, and we were deteriorating at a slower rate than they. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They were thrown in directly from the good life to the very, very bad, and they both died fairly soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We were all being starved, and my grandmother had an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The so-called "Aelteste der Juden", you wouldn't know which one. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The man who was in charge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> was named Chaim Rumkowski. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Before the war, he was an agent for an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and collected money for the orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Since my family was involved in charitable work and donated money to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , my grandmother decided that I should go to see him and ask him for some help because there was some sort of help. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">There were so- called talons (ph), small pieces of paper for some food distribution, and I went to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It's another moment in my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was a long <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He was at the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and I was at the other one, at the other end. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I was led in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I said to him in Polish " Panye President," which means Mr. President. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And at that moment, he picked up a cane and wanted to hit me because he resented the fact that I didn't speak Jewish to him, which I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I quickly told him "I am from this-and-this family." </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And at that, he stopped and said, "Where do you live?" </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Then I gave him the address and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He sent next day somebody with few of the pieces of papers for some sugar and for me to work in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And that was a life-saving because I could eat some bread in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , and I could take some small pieces <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my ration card was being used by my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">This lasted three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Three months later because they were changing -- three months later, he remembered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He had fantastic memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He switched me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was called <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> -- some sort of <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They were feeding for two weeks soup to workers who were essential to their production in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had several <span class="BUILDING">establishments</span> working for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">In order to stay alive we were obligated to produce some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">In that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I worked as a waitress. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And one day about a week later, this Mr. Rumkowski's sister-in-law came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and she saw me and she said, "Cut your hair," and I didn't understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And said, "Out," and she threw me out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Well, that was a tragedy because that's where the food was. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I spoke to the aide to Mr. Rumkowski, who was afraid of her because she thought that she was a princess in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">People had very wrong ideas about themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He was instrumental in assigning me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where they were peeling potatoes, and I was very happy about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I was peeling potatoes all day long, and trying to steal some of the peels to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because peels meant food. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">All this ended soon after. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was being systematically emptied. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">There were transports; people were being sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">At that time, even Rumkowski couldn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He had several people whom he knew from before the war from helping the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> or whatever, and he sent -- I don't remember the number -- maybe there were 40 or 50 of us young women to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the outskirts called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marianské</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And we were there, working there in some meaningless work we performed. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We were supposed to build cement blocks for the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were being ruined in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They were trying to have cement blocks to build some sort of shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We were there for a while, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was being systemically emptied, one transport after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And Rumkowski amongst them. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were going then from August 1944, and after a while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was almost empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">My mother and I and some of my friends were still fortunate enough from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , which contained 500 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">There were two groups left in the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">One was ours from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marianské</span> , and one was hidden on a <span class="DLF">street</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jakuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I only know about it because I had a friend who was hidden there. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">At that time, I was not aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The 500 of us were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> had a couple of physicians with their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We slept, my mother and I, in a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with about 20 other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I think we had -- I don't remember if there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , but we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We would lie down in rows. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">For a small infraction, a couple of people were being taken away and sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The German who was in charge of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called Hans Bebolt (ph), typical, extremely good-looking man. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Blonde, typical Aryan appearance; he was brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He selected one of the girls and then he shot her. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">This was the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">There was one incident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which I forgot about. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">If I may, I'll go back to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">When we were still living in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this gentleman who gave it to us and we were so very hungry, we decided that I will try to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to people that we knew from before the war who lived in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were of German origin, but Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Their name was Mensel family. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I took my star off, the Jewish star, and I smuggled myself through the <span class="DLF">wires</span> , and I walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">with the fear in my heart looking at people, looking at little dogs which reminded me of my dog that I had to leave at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , everything seemed very normal to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But I knew that I didn't belong there. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Finally, I reached the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we left, and I walked up a very broad <span class="DLF">staircase</span> , my heart was beating wildly because I didn't know how they will react to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Will they let me in? </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Maybe they moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It was a long time, and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and it was opened by young Nina, who was the daughter of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">As she looked at me, I saw the terror in her eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">She was stricken with terror looking at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I was taken aback, but after a minute, she composed herself and put a finger to her lips indicating that I shouldn't speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I found out that there were some German people invited to dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They were some sort of relation of Mr. Mensel, and she brought me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and Mr. and Mrs. Mensel saw me and hugged me and gave me dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I ate with them dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I was sitting at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> looking at the tablecloth, looking at the proper appointment on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I ate like a normal human being, and I started to resent the fact that I had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I almost forgot about everybody else that I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But, of course, the situation changed in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">After some small talk, the man was -- the German was in life, he was a professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He had a great deal of knowledge, and the conversation was so welcome to me, so normal, and I was not used to it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And young Nina helped me, she said to explain to them that I came for some books. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And the books, of course, was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And she and her mother prepared some food, and I was already getting nervous because the curfew hour was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And they gave me some parcels and said that I'll be back. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The young soldier wanted to see me next week, and all my friends said that they will let him know if T'll be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I took the parcel, and I started to walk towards the <span class="DLF">wires</span> , towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Again, my heart was beating wildly. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I was so, so very frightened because there were German patrols going on both sides of the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And I had to time myself to a split second when they turned around and won't be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And when I saw that he turned around, I ran to the wire, so I spread them through the parcels, and I caught part of my dress on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And I saw it, so I retrieved a little piece, grabbed the parcels, and ran towards the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was not too far from the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And when I reached my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the stress of the entire day gave up to tremendous, tremendous sobbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I just couldn't believe what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I knew that with my family I had to move from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> after certain couple of months because the Germans were making the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> much smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And we moved to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on Zierske (ph) Street. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">This was a main <span class="DLF">street</span> in that part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> passing by. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Since we were -- and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> belonged to the population -- since we were not supposed to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> , 1t was cutting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in half. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They built a <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span> over the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">When we lived, for instance, on one side of the wire, and we worked on the other, we had to cross the <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> assigned to us was right next to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That was before I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marianské</span> where Rumkowski sent me to the girls and then back, I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , which was my last stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There was a German -- I cannot recall his name -- I tried so hard the last few days to recall his name because I was looking forward to this interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">He promised to take this group to his place of work and spare us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">He was to take this group to his place of work and spare us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I knew about a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> that they were gassing people because there was a hidden radio in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and once even I listened to this radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">This German reassured us that when you will be taken away, we won't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">When we walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to work after the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was empty, it was a very weird feeling and the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , open <span class="DLF">windows</span> , flowing curtains blowing with the wind. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">No people. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Once we thought that we saw a glimmer of somebody in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , or a candle or something, and, of course, we averted our eyes not to give away to the German escorts that somebody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">In November of 1944 came our time we had to be taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The entire population of our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was walked to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> were, and we were loaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It was a horrible thing because people had to stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit or squat. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">If somebody was sick or even dying, he died on his feet standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It was just unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Water was the worst, lack of water, the thirst was the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I tried very hard to suppress some of the moments because the life is beckoning, life is normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I want to live a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I want to be part of my family, which is very wonderful to me, but from time to time, these things keep on coming back and they haunt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I'm particularly happy that I am able to speak of it and to leave something behind me for mostly the young people, the people who never will, never heard, or heard a little bit about it, what it is about man's inhumanity to man. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">This <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took us to first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruick</span> was mainly a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was large, we never knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We were the only transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> that did not go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; he kept his word about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="247"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> , though, was a <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We were stripped of our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We went through a medical examination, which was -- I cannot even say the word "embarrassing" because the people who conducted it were less than human. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They were less than animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We were many young girls who never undergone gynecological examinations, and they were looking for, God knows, diamonds or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We were subjected to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I had never seen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> like that before in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We were humiliated at every moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Our clothes was taken away from us, and we were directed to a heap of clothes which probably was left from the group that was killed previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I received some sort of a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I tried hard to remember, but I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But there was some sort of a dress that was a little warmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">My mother, on the other hand, was given a long, silk dress, and it was November and it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I don't know what kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The food we were given was, of course, of no nutritional value, no value whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It was watery soup, one slice of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We had no possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">All of us stopped menstruating because we had no nutrition in our bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We started to resemble skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I developed on my right arm large pus deposits that would swell to the size of egg, which I covered under the sleeve because there is still a will to live and to survive no matter how horrible the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Our family, when we were still together, promised each other that if one of us would survive, we should try -- at least one -- to shout to all the world, to all the <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> , to all the people and to bear witness to what we were going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">To what people were capable of doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we had to get up at dawn -- it was dark -- to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">These were so-called appells, an <span class="DLF">Appell Platz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We were standing in rows, long rows of miserable looking human wretches, and we were being counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They were twice a day, the Appells. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">One day I was fainting because between the hunger and malnutrition, I was just fainting. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And the Germans had dogs with them, large German Shepherds, who were being trained to attack people. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And they let one go as I was lying down, and the dog came to me and licked my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That's another moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I came to. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I adore dogs and animals, and I don't know if it's true if the dog sensed it or not, but that's the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The dog did not touch me, he licked my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And my friends picked me up, and I was again standing there as a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">That was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> had many women prisoners from different <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We did not see them because the <span class="DLF">block</span> -- there were <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The <span class="DLF">block</span> that we were in was so temporary, we were coming and going, all being killed or sent somewhere to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They were mixed bunch of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">The wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were about two or three tiers high, and I was with my mother on one middle one and across from us were German prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The German prisoners that were across from us were prisoners from before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The were murderers; they were all kinds of outcasts of the society. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">However, they were superior to us because they had the German blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We were only Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The two German women who were across from us were two women; one of them was called Peter and she was the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I was 16, 17, 18, 19 years old, I don't remember, and this was the first time that I was exposed to something like that, and she could hit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We had no right to say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">She was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">In that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were issued triangles of different colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">The black triangles, which the murderers wore, were given to the murderers and to the prisoners of crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The green ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The green ones, excuse me, the green ones were given to the thieves, common thieves. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The purple ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses, who were wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">These were Germans who did not believe in violence, and they were thrown with us and shared our lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I promised myself that if I survived the war, I'll help them -- let me compose myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I kept my word. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I never sent the Jehovah Witnesses from my <span class="DLF">door</span> , never excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">May I have a tissue? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">This was first time that I saw some sparkle of humanity in this Gehenna, in this <span class="NPIP">hell</span> that we were going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They were gentle and they told us to hold on because the war will end and the good will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Going back to the triangles. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Pink were given to homosexuals, which Hitler didn't consider as pure German. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">One of his balonies there. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And we, the Jews, had red one with a yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Pure red one was political prisoner, but with yellow was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We were on the lowest rank of this diabolical system. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We were nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was niece of and Audette (ph), a French resistance fighter who was well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They were kept separately because they were valuable to Germans as eventual exchange prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We were there about four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Our work to which we were assigned was carrying stones from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another and then back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">There was no purpose; it was hard; it was almost impossible; it was freezing cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We had no clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We had no food, but we had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">One day there was announcement made that the people from our group are to assemble. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We were being shipped somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We were shipped again in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We reached a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Elbe</span> , which 1s in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Of course, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's united now. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">At that time, it was the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> was a medium- sized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">The population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> had two things that they were proud of. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">One of them was <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arado</span> , which produced a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And the other was the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in which Martin Luther put the 95 theses to the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had a deep religious background. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">However, this did not prevent the population of being cruel and less than human. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We were placed in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , numbered <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and the only fortunate part of it was that we, the Jewish girls from our transport, were all in one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">One lady amongst this group was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">She was about, I say, about four or ftve months pregnant, and we tried to shield her as much as possible because we were all so skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Because she was skinny even being pregnant because there was no nourishment there. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Being on our own in this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> proved to one point was good that we selected the person who was in charge, and she was very fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">She cut the pieces of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The other <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">There was one German woman who came up once and hit me and broke five of my teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But it was all nght because she was German, and I was a Jew, so I couldn't even report this. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were taken to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we were needed to work in the <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The previous group that worked there, I believe there was an accident, and they needed replacement. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Since we were the meat they handled, we were sent there because there was a great supply of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We had to get up at dawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We were counted again on an <span class="DLF">Appell Platz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And then we had to march to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was -- I don't remember how long was that march, but when we reached the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we crossed a few <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And the people who saw us walking were spitting at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Children were taught that we are goddamn Jews, no good, dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We didn't look too appetizing; that's for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But did they ever think what the circumstances were that brought us to this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Because I remember watching documentaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">How did the German soldiers look when they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and they were being defeated and they walked through the snow with the rags on their feet and rags on their heads? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They didn't look any better than we did at this time, because they were being reduced to subhuman state. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">It 1s the circumstances that makes people look this way, and we were being made to look this way by other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">By other people who during the day beat us, tortured us, spit at us, killed us, and then went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to their wives and children and dogs and played with them and ate their dinner, and they never even gave a thought to what they did as what they considered work. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The work became to them a hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They were being conditioned to like their work. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They did not consider us as somebody who has brain equal or better than theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Who can think, who can feel, who can love, who can teach, who give and share good things with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The man who was in charge of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> lived right across from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was surrounded by <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> and had high <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> with machine guns manned by the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">When he left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at sa certain hour, he had his God that he loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He had children running around the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I could never reconcile the fact that he was called a man, and I couldn't say that he was an animal because I like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Well, we marched through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to our <span class="BUILDING">place of work</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We were supposed to work for 12 hours straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The work was divided into two 12-hour shifts: day shift manned by us, and night shift which was manned by the Russian prisoners of war who were kept somewhere there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We were assigned to different parts of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They were called Halle A, B, C, D and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">My misfortune was to be assigned to Halle Ha, which is H. There were only a few of us that were assigned there. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">My supervisor was an elderly German man, so-called Meister, who knew that the war was being lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It was 1945 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He took his revenge on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He beat me, stomped on me mercilessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">One day , the work in that particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> of work to which I was assigned was to rivet parts of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , the wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I had a riveting gun, which was made of steel and was very heavy, and rivets. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I had to put the rivets through two <span class="DLF">holes</span> to join the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and they were spaced every so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">The work was very hard because it was freezing cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">You can imagine how tremendous the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> being assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Huge, and it was very, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And the steel gun froze to the flesh of my hand when I was riveting. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">There were four of us that I knew that were in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , H. One day I noticed a very tiny script on part of the wing in a different script that I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It was a Russian script. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And one person knew how to decipher this, and it was written there "Try if you can to skip every so often when you rivet and leave a little bit of opening." </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Now, we realized that if we would do that, we risked death, but this was a lifesaver for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We can do something positive because logically if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> 's in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , the force of wind may force this rivet out because it's not completely sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And if enough of them would be blown out, the part would disintegrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And we were delighted, and we started to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I did this for a little while, and one day I infected my finger with part of steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I knew that the infection was bad because I had a red stripe going up my arm and swollen glands underneath my armpit, so I knew that's bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And here it was already March '45, going towards April. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">April, it was April. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I don't recall the dates exactly, and my friend said, "You must survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We could hear the sounds of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We knew that the armies are coming closer and closer and closer because we were being sent more and more towards middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And I developed high fever, so we had so-called Krankenrevier, which is place the sick people were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Prior to this, they were taken away and shipped somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But since this was already so late, they took me there and two of the prisoners amongst us, the Jewish group, were doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Two young lady doctors, and one of them Dr. Levine, who I don't know if she's still alive, pulled my nail without any anesthesia, without anything -- she had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Pulled the nail off me and squeezed the pus. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Normally, if this would happen here, if you don't have penicillin or streptomycin or antimycin, you probably die. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I didn't die of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It some sort of healed over. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I had no nail. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I had some straps all around it, I think, from the dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I don't remember what she wrapped around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I was in pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They permitted me to stay in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> for sick, and I was sitting in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">All the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were blackened because there were air raids already coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And one day an SS woman came and she asked, "Who can knit?" </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And I said to myself I knew how to knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I knew that properly brought girls were supposed to play piano, speak French and German, knit, and cook, besides the schoolwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I knew how to knit, so I raised my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And she said, "I have to have a sweater within few days." </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And she brought me knitting needles and wool, and I was knitting without this finger, constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But she brought me soup and piece of bread for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">As I was knitting for few days, one day they came to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ; they boarded the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They didn't let anybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The Russians were already at the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and the fighting was going on and we heard the fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We didn't know who was coming, but we knew whoever it 1s, it's the liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So to us, it didn't mean much. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So we all stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The plan was to destroy us, but they didn't have enough time. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Just a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But what I think we should do is why don't you back up to the SS woman coming in saying, "Can anybody knit?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">The SS woman, a heavy, big woman, came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were, the few sick people, and asked if anybody can knit, and I thought that maybe this will help me to survive since I'm the one -- I'm still here. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I said, "I can knit." </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I raised my hand and she brought knitting needles and wool and asked me to make her a sweater as fast as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Evidently, they wanted to shed their uniforms, which we found later on spread around there, and have civilian clothes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They were big, heavy people; they had sticks with them to hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And I started to knit in spite of my broken ribs and finger which was bandaged superficially and pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I knitted and knitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And she brought me some soup, some cold soup, and so- called bread, which was made with some sort of sawdust, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I ate very greedily, and I knitted the sweater until few days later, I found out that nobody could leave the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> because the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were boarded and so were the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And we didn't see through the cracks, we didn't see anybody manning the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">The German soldiers were gone, so we realized that we are sentenced to be disposed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">It was almost a tonic. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We heard the sounds of fight -- guns, couldn't identify what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The <span class="DLF">sky</span> was turning almost crimson red, and we were huddled. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Then one of the girls who was very enterprising, she said, "Nobody's here. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Let's break the <span class="DLF">door</span> and go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Food was on everybody's mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Food, food was life. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They broke the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Now, I couldn't; I was lying down. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They broke the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the main <span class="NPIP">place</span> , from the main <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and from the <span class="NPIP">sick place</span> , and they ran to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">What they found in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> were bars of margarine bars, and raw potatoes and couple of eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They scooped the margarine with their hands, and they brought two eggs and some potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And since the <span class="DLF">door</span> was broken down, we decided to leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">My people took me by my arms and grabbed me, and we crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> to where the commandant's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Well, his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was empty; he ran away with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So we went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">There were six or seven of us -- seven, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">How to cook the two eggs and divide, and the raw potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">While they were busy cooking and as they were cooking, the commandant came back with a cocked gun facing us, the seven of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">There was group of subhumans watching this man, this well-fed, big man with the gun, and he was afraid of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">It was -- if it wouldn't be so tragic, it would be comical. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He backed out with the gun and he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We decided it's not safe to stay there, so we started to run towards the fire because where the fire was coming from, whoever tried to liberate, was there fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">As we were running, we encountered two young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They happened to be Polish, and they were there not as prisoners, but they were taken from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> because their young people and old people and whoever was capable was fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They needed people to work the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and the two Polish people joined our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">One of the girls was killed by a piece of shrapnel in the very last moment before liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And the rest of us started to run toward the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They were holding me all the way, and we reached a <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- it's another moment -- where a dirty, strange-looking man in filthy uniform with Asiatic-looking face, very tiny eyes, with a little cappy sort of a hat and big boots, and we realized that this is not a German at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We were ready to kiss his boots as filthy as he was, but he told us dawai, "In the back, in the back." </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We were so called liberated, we didn't know what was ahead of us yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We went behind -- this is still the <span class="DLF">war line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They are fighting -- go. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Food, they had a bottle of herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We started to eat this herring, one after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And we were tremendously thirsty, and there was no water because the pipes froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We all got sick, very sick from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">See, the Russians are, I must say, very sturdy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They were fighting eating the herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It was incomprehensible to us, but that's the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And they told us to get away from there, so we started to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was not touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , neat <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , lovely <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , and sounds of starving animals because the Germans ran away and left the poor beasts unfed. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">They were running for life, so there were cows, there were pigs howling. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We got to one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and since the firing was going on both ways, we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">There were the two Polish guys and man and five girls, frve women. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> which was very well appointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They had <span class="INT_SPACE">sleeping accommodation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">They had shelves stocked with jars with conserves, with meat, with whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And they had a barrel of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">They were very well prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">We ate and we lie down. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was approachable by some sort of a <span class="DLF">door</span> which swings out and up and down, and in the middle of the night two Russians came and opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And they wanted women. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I became hysterical because if I survived to this point, I don't want to live anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I told one of the Polish men that if he would save me, I would do anything possible because my family's very influential. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I thought they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And he put me down on one of these wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> , which was prepared for sleeping and covered me and sat down on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">The other girls did the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The third girl hid in a <span class="NPIP">corner</span> , and two girls were raped. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">One of them is still alive that's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but I understand that she's in a <span class="BUILDING">mental institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Once -- the demeanor of the Russian soldier is very difficult to describe now because we see them now after all these years of changes, these were people who were fighting the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The closest I can identify them, they were grunzens (ph) or kalmucks??. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They couldn't understand the difference, what's the difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">A woman's a woman; I mean, a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">What's wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They were childlike. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Here they were fighting, and here this is quite all right, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They drank whatever was there, and then one of them took a gun and started to shoot the jars with the fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And the pieces of glass and the red fluid from them started to seep all over, and I had glass embedded in my left leg throughout the winter because I wanted to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I reached that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I was going to tell the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I remembered my promise, so I had the glass in my leg and the red fluid all over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I was -- and the Polish young man was sitting on top of me, and that was till the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">When the morning finally arrived, we decided to leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we walked, walked, walked to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , there were beautiful <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> all beautifully prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Food, chickens, china. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we scouted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We saw that there was an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So we ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I remember the two young Polish guys were running up to the chickens with a stick to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We cooked the chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We took the china with the tablecloth, threw out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We weren't going to save anything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">This was our little revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Silly as it might sound now. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We decided we would sleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We took the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We climbed the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and slept quietly in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">One of the girls was a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">She decided she liked one of the Russian officers, so she stayed downstairs, and she went with him wherever she wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">In the middle of the night, we went to -- we were alone on the top in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The two Polish younb men are sleeping in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> downstairs, and we hear German voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It seems the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were facing a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">young forest</span> , and there were Germans hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">They were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">They wanted to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They got to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and they were eating food in our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So we were very frightened, even though we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We went underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> there upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We went underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">One of the girls could not hold her bladder from fear, and that's how we were lying in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And two Polish young men jumped out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> because there was low part there, and they went to the Russians wherever they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They had already so-called stabilized the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they told them that there were Germans in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So the Russians came over, and we hear them <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="550">Let's throw grenades," or whatever the name is of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They were going to kill the Germans or dynamite the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">They didn't care about property either. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But here we are, four of us, under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So we started to scream, "No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">There are Polish people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">There are Polish people here." </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The two Germans opened the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> and started to run to the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They were lying there for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Each one of us took something from the German body. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I had a pair of scissors, little scissors that he had on his body. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I still have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The next day there were French prisoners, ex-prisoners of war, who lived in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Now, I could communicate with them, and I told them that I'm scared to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">The other girls decided they want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I was afraid to make one step <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So the French people invited me to stay with them, and that's how I parted company with the Polish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">French house</span> , and they said they would protect me; they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Each one is a separate story, and there are numbers of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Because the brain is supposed to be a storage of all these things, but yet it's almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There are things that I omitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">There are things that are coming back now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Can I ask you a couple of questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  I'm not going to go in chronological order, necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Your mother was with you when you were deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  And your mother was with you for how long, and what happened to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  My mother was with me until we worked in that -- until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> , and then she was taken somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">My mother was taken away from me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> , and I didn't know what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I found her after the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg Sachsenhausen</span> , which was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and she was already mortally ill and she passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">If somebody was not capable of carrying the work, they were useless to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And even though she was quite young, she was 42 years old, but she had swollen legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">She was skeleton-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">She deteriorated very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">She was useless.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  But she carried stones with you at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  And when she was taken away, do you remember how that happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I mean, were you there?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , tell me what you used as a support system. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Did you use your imagination? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Tell me about what --
ANSWER:  My support system was very much the family background. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">The basis that I was given from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">The love, the support, the thirst for education and living, and, most of all, the promise that we would try to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We would try to bear witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">We would try no matter what and how, even if it would require something that is out of ordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">For instance, my grandmother was an observant Jewess. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">We were not, but she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">She was not supposed to eat meat that was not slaughtered in a certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">She was not supposed to eat horse meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">But when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the beginning, they were sending some sort of horse meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And she ate it because, as I understand, our religion teaches that in order to survive if you are very sick there are certain things that are permissible and this was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Like an absolution, she ate horse meat which would be unthinkable under normal circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So the thirst of being here, surviving, and telling the people -- you have no idea how very much I look toward today, the moment that I can share some of my experiences to leave behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">To be part of the oral history, I will feel that I accomplished something very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I am more than delighted that this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> came into being. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I feel that it's a tremendous tool for all humanity, that it 1s the most necessary tool to teach people of all persuasions that such a thing must never happen again to any people anywhere, anytime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , religious practices were forbidden, I assume, and did you witness any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  As I previously said, I was not brought up religiously. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">My religion was mainly the tradition of our people, and we were invited by grandparents for the observant holidays that we shared together. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I loved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I loved them; I observed the tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">It's still something that will stay with me and something that my daughter now values and my granddaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">She said to me, my granddaughter, which is the future -- the young person that will carry on. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">She said, "Nanna, no matter who I will marry, I will remember my background, and I will always carry on in my heart and life the thought of who you were, who we are, and what has to be done." </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So this is like carrying the torch. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It is, to me, religion, and the religion observances are not as necessary as in my heart I feel I am a righteous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">That's what my father taught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">My father said that God surrounds us all, no matter what his name or image 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">God 1s in every blade of grass. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">God 1s in every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> that flows. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And if I observe the commandments, which all of us should, then I am a religious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">There were some people who would have liked to have observed candlelighting or somebody that would have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there are still some candles which my grandmother had. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But later on, we didn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I didn't even -- I was not even aware which day this is, what holiday, what day. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The days were melting into one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">You were not aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">You were busy trying to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Did you ever have dreams about food?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Our food was very important of our dreams and our talks, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">The body needs fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Food is the fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Once your body 1s satisfied then you can function properly, so we shared the dreams of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">In one particular instance when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with my mother, and we were issued the daily portion of small piece of bread and soup, my mother taught me to share the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">To share, that means to divide into two portions: one to eat when I go to sleep and the next one in the morning before the long day of this horrible work. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I tried to obey her, and I put this piece of bread underneath me and she put hers, because we slept together. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I dreamt and I dreamt of bread and the thoughts were coming how wonderful bread can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Fresh and sweet smelling and when you put the knife to it, you can smell the aroma. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I said (sniff) oh, I 02:30: could imagine the aroma of bread, how wonderful bread can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We never thought of it, how luxurious bread can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And I was thinking what I would put on my bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I was making it up, stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Plum butter, butter, wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And, of course, that was a revelry because the Ukrainian woman who was the Kapo, I don't know if this term is being explained is where the helpers for the German soldiers, the women who took care of us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="656">The Kapos started to wake us up, heraus,heraus means. "</span><span class="sentence" id="657">Get up, out." </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Always roughly, there was no normal language there. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I didn't want to wake because I still had this image of bread before my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And my mother said, "We must, my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">we must. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We have to go to the <span class="DLF">Appell platz</span> to be counted." </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And we looked for the bread, the precious piece of bread, and it wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">It was stolen during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">All ethical upbringing sometimes disappears in times like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Some people were not capable of preserving their humanity, and somebody stole this precious piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And I wrote a story about it, and I ended the story with if I should hate the thieves. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I came to the conclusion, no; I should hate the perpetrators who reduced these people to this level. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">That the people who stole the bread were not strong enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Their hunger was greater than their morality. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There were some of them who couldn't stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">There were some of us who had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">My mother wanted to share her piece with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I wanted to share my piece with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">This is what differs us.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Tell me about your beatings and how you were hurt and why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  The last beating that I received was in April of 1944, and it was done not by SS, but it was done by the German supervisor in my <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where I worked <span class="BUILDING">Arado</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I was very sick at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I had fever, my finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I couldn't perform the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">He didn't know that I was sabotaging all along, but the beating was about my inability to perform my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He threw me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He wore high boots, and he started to stomp on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They didn't have guns, the Meisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He was stomping on me breaking my ribs. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I had a fever anyway because my finger was infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And the two girls that worked in the same division, the same horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> , had come back after our work and that's when I went to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the sick people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And they said, "Don't say a word because in a few days we will be liberated." </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We knew the fire was -- we were liberated April 20-something when the Russians reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> and displaced the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They had no time to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">The plan was to kill us, but they just plainly didn't have time and I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">As a result of the beating, I have to wear a brace for the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I did not have proper medical care, because the Russians were too busy fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They did, however, provide bandages which they rolled around me, strapped me when we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I asked them, so I was rolled in their bandages. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And that was maybe one thing that I was not very useful to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I wear a brace. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">As a result of the brace and the ribs that didn't heal properly, I developed tremendous curvature of the spine which worsened with the advent of my pregnancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">The doctors warned me that this would occur, but I didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I thought that I do have to have a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I owe it to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I owe it to myself, and I owe it to my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And I have been blessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I have a wonderful daughter, a wonderful son-in-law, British. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I have a a wonderful grandchild. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I have wonderful husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So in some way, somewhere my family up there knows that I have been blessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Many times I am asked, especially in two <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">One was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> that I spoke last year and the nuns and the children were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And another <span class="NPIP">place</span> there was very good reception was the Navy Intelligence Unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And one of the questions that always pops out is "How did you permit this to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Why didn't you defend yourself?" </span><span class="sentence" id="743">See, young people in the Navy, strong, hopefully intelligent -- if they are in the Intelligence Unit, they must be very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">They cannot perceive the conditions that we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We were surrounded by population which was not only unfriendly, but openly hostile to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">We couldn't have a gun if we would beg them on knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We had nothing, we had no food, we were starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">We had no strength to do the most minor, meaningless things. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">We were absolutely helpless. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Many people gave up, committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">A number of them, because they did not want to continue this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Many people gave up because they thought somebody from the family would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Many people said, "Is this what God wanted for us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And yet, many people died with God's name on their lips, so there is no one answer to this 02:41: question. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Then they asked me "Can you forgive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="756">That's different question. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I cannot forgive the people who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I can't ever forgive them, but I have to forgive the younger people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because they were informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And I have to give them the opportunity to show their outlook on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They are not guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They did not participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Some of them who were born of Nazis trying to repent for their fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Of course, there are some pro-Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">There are neo-Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But we have everyone everywhere, wherever we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We have always a group of people who are, I would say, inferior, and to show their so-called superiority, they think that other people are not up to their par and do not deserve to live or do not deserve -- whatever 1s their philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But I dismissed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I have to forgive the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">There is nothing to forgive, the ones who didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">As a matter of fact, when I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> through the Quaker Society, I arranged to have German young people who were exchange to visit us, to share our meal and to discuss things with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Not of the past, but for the future because that's what we are talking about, the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We are interested in the future, and I think that I made some strides there. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I think that's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I think this is part of the philosophy of our <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , to talk about the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">That the past should never be forgotten, but 1t should never be repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  Don't you think that your sabotage was fighting back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  Tell me again about your sabotage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  That's very interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I did what I was told to do because it wouldn't have occurred to me on my own, and it was a great deal of satisfaction that I was able to do something against the war machine, against the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It was some food for my soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I was doing something that they didn't know of, something to help to dismantle the war machine in as little a way as I possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And one day when I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> -- I am an ardent book reader- I came upon a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">It was a story about mother and daughter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and the story sounded so much like my story that I decided to write to the author. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I didn't know who wrote the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was a mother and daughter working 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near a <span class="BUILDING">bomb site factory</span> , and they were going to take the mother away because she was not able to perform the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And the daughter begged her to leave the mother and she would do work for two. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">They refused, and they took the mother away. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">There are three subplots in that book. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">One is that there are some American airmen who know that there is a group of German airmen who are planning to bomb Downing Street Number 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Now, this was the seat of Winston Churchill in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">So here you have the story of the American airmen, the German airmen, how they trained, and the story in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And to make the whole story shortest, the air raid is on. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They German whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> is flying towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and so do the Americans from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And the Americans are able to shoot every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> with the exception of the leader <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> who was able to reach <span class="BUILDING">Downing Street 10</span> and release the bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And the bomb falls and does not explode because this is the bomb that the girl didn't put the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> as a revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">That was the bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Well, when I read this book, I just had goose pimples because I did something with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">So I wrote a letter and I sent to the publisher of the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And a month later I received a letter from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , which I have it with me, from a British writer who wrote the story and wrote me a beautiful letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And who said, "It is people like you, the little, quiet people, individuals who tried to do something to whom we in a way may owe a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">You performed some" -- I have this letter which I'm going to give Mrs. Jones, and it makes me feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Incidentally, I receive every year greetings from Mr. Clyde and I write to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And we keep up a correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">He knew the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ; he knew the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , were there -- did you ever witness torture or executions or --
ANSWER:  Torture, yes; beatings, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I experienced it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I did not experience murdering before my eyes because they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I've seen, though, girls running to the wires, the electric wires and being executed -- exterminated, well, they committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Incidentally, which reminds me that I never, never, ever, when I speak to groups, I never use the word "extermination." </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Because in my mind you exterminate vermin, but you murder human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">You don't exterminate them, you murder them. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So you exterminate roaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">We cannot be compared to roaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">We are human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  Do you remember incidents of unusual courage or selflessness in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Sharing food was one of the most unselfish things that one can think of because food represented life. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">There were people who were giving away part of their portion to others; that was unselfish. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">One of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends -- I went to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> for girls -- one of the girls from my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as well, with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And she became very, very ill, and they wanted to deport her. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">All of us who were her friends from our meager portions decided to take a little bit and get it together and bring to her every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">You can't imagine the value of food in those days to give away. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I had a glove, somehow, somewhere, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So the glove was being worn by everybody by my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">We were sharing the one glove, so one hand for few minutes was getting out of the numbness. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I don't know who the glove really belonged to, but I was given it, and we shared this glove. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And I remember this glove, and when I met one of the girls after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , she said to me, "Blanka, do you remember your glove?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="829">Yes, I remember the glove." </span><span class="sentence" id="830">This was something that was very important at that time, the glove. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Like the bread, like the canary, like the little flower, the glove was very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  Is there -- do you think -- maybe you can't answer this, but do you think there was something different about the experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for women, in general, versus for men? </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Do you think they confronted it differently? </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I know the sabotage is one thing that got suggested to the women by the men who worked at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And the men, the Russian men, they were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">None of them survived, but they were trained for war, and they knew what to do and they told us what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">We, the four of us working _, had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">We needed somebody to tell us, and these people were soldiers and they had some idea what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And once this occurred to us, it was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">It gave us a shot of energy, of being useful, of doing a little part. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were together, women and men, and I worked in several <span class="NPIP">places</span> before I went to Mr. Rumkowski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="843">One of them was <span class="BUILDING">knitting factory</span> , sweaters, which we were turning. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And there were only women in my division, so I couldn't tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">There were men and women in the <span class="BUILDING">distribution place</span> where the food came, but I had nothing to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">That's why we were starving so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Women sometimes, as enemies sometimes can be more vicious than men. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">The women SS were very, very vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">For instance, when the dog came to me, he was directed by a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And the dog didn't bite me, but licked me and came back to his master. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">He did not do anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">He could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I wonder if this would be a woman, if she wouldn't have killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I don't know the answer, but the men somehow realized that the dog heard that I was his friend, and he let me live. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">There is so many incidents that collectively helped me to survive, and this is another moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It's like carved in my memory forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">It's a moment, it's an etching. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And this was one of them, the dog.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="861">ANSWER:  They were very brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Most of them somehow were very heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They were very busty. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And I don't know if they ate so much or if they had such good positions, but they were extremely heavy, the ones that I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And they were brutal; they were -- the hatred came from the eyes already and the Peitsche (whip) was always ready to strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">They were -- they felt so superior and, God knows, they were nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But they felt so powerful, they thought that this will never end. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But when the one came for the sweater, she cowered. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">She took the sweater because I finished the sweater and she ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I never have seen her since. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And my memory -- I don't remember her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I think it's merciful. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I think that certain things, subconsciously, you don't want to keep before your eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I erased her from my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I don't recall what she looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I don't remember the face of the Meister who crippled me for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I remember his hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I remember the beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I remember the terror and the pain, but I don't remember his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">That's another situation that I probably want to erase the face from my conscious and from my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I don't want to be haunted by this face. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Merciful.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="891">QUESTION:  Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">In September of 1939, when the Germans already occupied our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and after they ordered the curfew and all the other restrictions on the general population and especially on the Jews, people became panicky. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">My mother had one sister who was married to a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He was mobilized as an officer in the Polish army, and with the Red Cross left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He was going toward the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Unfortunately, not knowing that eventually the Russians will cut them off and start war against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the <span class="REGION">east side</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">east quarter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And he was caught and eventually we received a small, small notification from him from a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katyn’</span> , which became very infamous in years to come because there were 10,000 Polish officers who were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katyn</span> ' and buried in a common <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">After the war, the Germans accused the Russians, and the Russians, in turn, accused the Germans who killed the 10,000 Polish officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">In the meantime, his wife was left with one son with us, and in the panic the rumor started that the families of the officers would be deported or arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So my aunt with her son, who was at that time about 11 years old, decided to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">People started to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Walking sounds very innocent, but this was an unbelieved movement of masses upon masses of humanity moving in one direction in darkness of the evening and in silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">You could only hear the footsteps. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We looked from our <span class="DLF">windows</span> and there were tens of thousands of people just going. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="908">They didn't know where, but they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">All kinds of rumors were flying around. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which we were living at the time with my grandmother was -- had five stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And one day during an air raid, we were standing on the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> because we didn't have <span class="NPIP">places</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Somebody ran in and told us that they saw somebody on our <span class="DLF">roof</span> with a flashlight. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">There were many, as I said before, German-origin people living in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">They were called Volksdeutsche, and they were showing signs to the enemy, to their friends with flashlights. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">We couldn't even realize these were neighbors, friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Watching the masses going and going, we were discussing should we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Grandma couldn't walk that far, so we decided to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">My mother decided to stay because this was her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I decided to stay because my mother stayed and my mother's two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And that's how we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Then they threw out some of our neighbors who were actually renting their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from us 1n the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , so they moved and stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And, eventually, there was a group of about 13 people, but we had a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so this was still no hardship. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Remembering the moving humanity at darkness at night silently was one of the very traumatic memories that I keep, and this was the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Eventually, my aunt reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I don't even know how, but I know that she reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And as a wife of a doctor, she was given a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with her son in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Since her husband was a physician and he was an officer on the way to war, they gave her <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and she was in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">We had couple of communications from her until 1942, where the communications stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz Ghetto</span> was formed at first, you still lived outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a while, didn't you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Can you give me some idea of the dates, as well as you remember them, the periods of time that were involved, and when your family actually moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if you remember the month?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="932">ANSWER:  I wouldn't remember the exact date, but I know that the war started in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Sometime late in September, my aunt left with her son for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">We stayed, we had some helpers at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a cleaning lady and -- who lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">They had their own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Unfortunately, they were less than sympathetic forgetting all the good years they spent with us, and they very brazenly came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and demanded this fur coat and this and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And they said, "Now, we are the ones who can tell you what to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And they took it and left, and, actually, we were glad they left because they could have done much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">One of them was very pretty and acquired a German boyfriend, so at that time, we thought, "Well, it's better that she's gone that she would come with him there." </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So we stayed without her, and you can get used to any kind of situation that you are thrown in. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I remember we didn't have fuel, so we had installed a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> in the middle of the beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And we had the bread rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">We were toasting the bread on top of this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Why do I remember this? </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Because I thought the bread tastes so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I never realized it before, so I remember this detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I also remember that before the war, I attended <span class="BUILDING">Polish private school</span> , many girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I remember with sorrow that not one of my girlfriends thought of coming over and bringing me some sort of food, not one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And yet they were good friends before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">They used to come and sleep over, stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I gave them help with work, small work. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">We were very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">That hurt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">But in the scope of time, it became very unimportant. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">At that time, I was very bitterly disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">The people who moved with us, from the other <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was occupied, were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">They lived a number of years with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Also, the family, Mensel family to whom I went once, smuggled myself through the <span class="DLF">wires</span> , were people who lived in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and they were lovely people. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">We entrusted them with several valuables because we thought that after the war we would be able to retrieve them. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And strangely enough, after the war was over and after my experience after the liberation, there was a period of time of two weeks that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">There was -- I don't know how to explain this, but this was a Polish man that had several little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> , and they were leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">They had a large Polish flag, and they said anybody that wants to go and join him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> can do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And I lived with the French ex-prisoners of war at that time, and I said to myself, "I should go because maybe my mother came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Maybe my aunt came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">My first responsibility 1s to see who came back, so I will go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So I joined this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravan</span> , an indescribable journey, we finally reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was reduced to rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">It was unrecognizable, and I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I had no money; I had no clothes; I had no luggage; I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I was just -- and there was a man with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">semi truck</span> , sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">When I found out that this man standing there, he said, "Hop on. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">You can go with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And I hopped on, and we traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And he stopped on the way, and he went to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I didn't want to tell him I'm hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">We drove all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">He never thought of giving me piece of bread, but I reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in before, the Polish superintendent who took care of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> reacted with tremendous surprise; not elation, but surprise that I survived and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And what for?

then they went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">To survive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for that many years, you have to do things, all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">You have to be brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">You have to have some sort of position there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">You have to bribe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">In that way we were very innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">We were completely unaware of anything when we first came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Our experience with the selection, we had to stand naked in front of the -- I don't know -- doctor or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">You couldn't have a pimple on your body. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">You had to be perfect for work, and then looking for the jewels, the vaginal experiments that -- it was -- the <span class="NPIP">hell</span> started right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">We were stripped of every, every human trace of behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">The brutality, the killing, the siccing the dogs -- the dogs were sicced at the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They were ripping the people apart with the exception of me, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And they had pleasure, the people liked to look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">The same people who lived a normal life outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">They had two kinds of life, and they completely reconciled with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">It was their work, and as they cleaned up in the war, they were assigned to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">But they embellished their love of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">They did it with pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">They didn't have to sometimes to do things that they did, but it became a badge of honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Human beings reduced to beasts, unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">To preserve sanity, to function after surviving this war, I don't think that we are 100 percent, but we try to pull on our reserves from our background, from our civilized way of living, from our teachings, our parents, and our teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">We try to create environment for us, ourselves, for our children, and we try to share our knowledge and forewarn future generations of the horror of what human beings are capable of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">That we must be on guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">We must protect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">We must speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Like Pastor Niemoeller said in his very famous speech, which I don't remember verbatim, but he said, "First, they came for the cripples, and I said nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Then, they came for the Communists, and I said nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Then, they came for the Catholics, I said" -- I don't remember completely. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Then, they came for the Jews, and I said nothing because I was not one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Then, they came for me, and there was nobody to speak up for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">That's why we must have the red flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">We must teach, we must educate, we must do the very least we can and we are capable of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">This is one of the reasons why I wanted so badly to come here and to speak up in my own little way to contribute from my past, from my knowledge, from my experience, from my broken down body. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">To tell the people the horror, the tragedy, the Gehenna that we went through must never happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1222">QUESTION:  I think that I have covered everything that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Do you have anything else that you want to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1224">ANSWER:  Well, I do hope that my message -- I don't know if it's going to be in the <span class="BUILDING">Archives</span> , in Oral History Department or whatever, that it could be shared with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">That I'm sure that many people before me said the same things, that they are being widely distributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I hope that in my own way I was able to impart and bare my soul and expose the horror that I was witness to and forewarn people and beg people to think and to pool their own resources. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">To read, to see if there a movie of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">Not be protected of themselves, like some people say, "I've seen enough of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">I can't take 1t anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I don't think it's right because once you see it, you're alerted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">It reinforces you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">It helps you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">That's why I feel that if one person can do something, it's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">That's why Schindler was important because he was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">His ideas maybe were different in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Maybe he did this for personal gain, that's how he started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">But, eventually, he was the savior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">No matter what his motives were, he did save a group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And these people multiplied, and they have future generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And they're grateful to him and his memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">That's why individual counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">That's my message.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">QUESTION:  Thank you very much.</span></p>
