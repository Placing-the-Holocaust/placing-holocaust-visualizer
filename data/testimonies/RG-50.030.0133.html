<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay, we’re on camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Would you tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My full name is Johanne Eva Liebmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My maiden name was Hirsch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  How were you called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Hanne.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  I was born on November 28, 1924, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> , <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  What did your parents do? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">What was your father's occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  My father was a photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He had his own <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My father died in February of 1925; I was obviously just a few months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my mother continued the business until 1938, December of 1938, when all Jewish businesses had to be closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What was it like for you, until 1938, growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Well, I would say that we had a very nice family life, in spite of not having a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My mother had three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They were in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They were in haute couture. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And, it was really a very loving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I had also my father's mother, my grandmother, who was a very elderly lady and our family life really was a very nice one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, I entered <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> like all children at age six, and I think I hated <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from the first day I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was made ever more difficult, because the teacher we had was even then a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I was a child that couldn't sit still, and had my mouth open probably all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And was punished for it a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It did not improve my love for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Did you have friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Were they Jewish friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Christian friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  I had a lot of friends 1n <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I think we were the only class, first grade class, at the time we were 24 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Out of the 24, 12 were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Fifty percent! </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was an extremely high percentage. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I think that was the only class ever that had such a high percentage of Jewish students. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> until 1936 when Jewish children were no longer allowed to go to public school unless their parent or their fathers were in the First World War and were in the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">These were the exceptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in 1936, and I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until Easter of 1940.' </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So I really didn't have a hell of a lot of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And after, I would say 1938, after Kristallnacht’, due to the fact that we had so many Jewish- old Jewish teachers that were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for many weeks and months, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was every other day two hours for many months until everybody had come back and there was a semblance of a normal <span class="BUILDING">school</span> day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Would you tell me a little bit about after 1933, ‘34. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">How, besides <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , how did life change for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Well, I would first like to go back before 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We lived and had our business next to a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">This newspaper was a left-wing newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we had daily street fights, mob scenes, shooting, flag burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">These are the first of my memories as a child outside the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It was a very violent <span class="DLF">street</span> we lived on. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">These are really my first memories and my mother or someone from the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> pulling me back from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and as soon as they turned their backs, my brother and I were back out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> watching what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">These are really my first memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">One of my other memories 1s the boycott of April 1933 where our <span class="DLF">show windows</span> were plastered with "Jew!" "</span><span class="sentence" id="55">Don’t go to the Jew!" </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">These are really some of my childhood memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Family life was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Outside the family, it was not so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You were insulted in the <span class="DLF">street</span> many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">You were called “dirty Jew,” things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">For several years, I did have Gentile girlfriends and, of course, under the pressure of the Nazi time they could no longer associate with me, and I would not dare associate with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Were you taunted by your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> mates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  By some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And like my husband, I beat up one. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And not only did I beat her, I actually tore her sweater to pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was not standing, you know, not letting it happen to me all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  As the Nazi regime went on, what else happened to you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Well, as time when on, of course, there was Kristallnacht. [</span><span class="sentence" id="70">01:06:00]
QUESTION:  Tell me about that. ' </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The interviewee later corrected this date to 1939. * </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Kristallnacht, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> obviously, and something seemed wrong, yet I didn't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And when I came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I mentioned that I saw the fire engines standing in front of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and in the back of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span> , I was told, "Don't you know what's going on?" </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I said, "No, I don't." </span><span class="sentence" id="76">She said -- this one told me, "My father was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">His father was arrested, and it was just a terrible situation." </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The teachers, other than the female teachers, did not come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And they sent us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I think, after about two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all our <span class="DLF">show windows</span> had been smashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My mother was sweeping up the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">To the taunts and harassment of the population or the people who were made to look like the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Next to us was a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that dealt in oriental carpets. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The <span class="DLF">show window</span> is gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Ink thrown over the carpets. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was, it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The only reason our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and business was not touched at the time was that they simply knew there was not a man to be arrested, so our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and our business upstairs remained in tact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  What did your family do after Kristallnacht? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">How did you mother manage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Well, we managed first of all to take care of a lot of customers at the time because every Jew needed an identification paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">To these purpose, you had to have a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The picture had to show your left ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So that every person had to be taken -- the picture had to be taken from this <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Your ear was supposedly an additional identification mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Another harassment. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And so we were really very busy in the business until the very end, until we absolutely closed on the 31st of December. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And, since I did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I helped in the business as people drifted back or came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , many times their first stop was really with us because they were so afraid they had to get the identification paper, the photos and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I saw many men with their ears frozen, their hands frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">My mother would run pots of soup to feed these people first before they would go wherever they needed, you know, went. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">It was a very hard, very busy time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  What happened after that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Nineteen thirty-nine, the three sisters of my mother who also had to close their business moved in with us because we had a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Obviously, we shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Half was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , half was business. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So there were all these empty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , so my aunts moved in with us because there was no more income so you had to reduce your living expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My grandmother had moved in with us after my brother left in 1937 because she was very old. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">She could no longer keep a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> of her own. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And so here were six women in one <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Not necessarily an ideal situation, but it functioned somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">When the war broke out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was on the list of evacuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">In other words, most of the population, meaning people with small children and very old people, were evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And SO we evacuated my grandmother, of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And many people went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , other <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they could go; my mother decided she was not going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And my mother's three sisters decided they were not going to go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We were going - just going to stay where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">My grandmother we sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> because it was very hard to move her in any emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">She was 90 years old, and so she was away from us for maybe four or five months, and then we took her back because there was actually no war. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There was war, but there was no shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There was nothing going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So what then was called "Drole de Guerre,"” and, and so we took her back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">This went, of course, until the day we were deported on the 22nd of October 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I would like to interject that in the spring of 1940 I was for four months in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , where my mother had sent me, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> if you wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It taught agriculture and horticulture and all sorts of things and my mother sent me up there because she didn't know what to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I was hanging around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I could not do any apprenticeship of any kind and so I was up there for four months and, I think it was four months, maybe five, and then I came back, I think, in August of 1940 because she was not feeling well. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And then we, of course, were deported in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Would you describe the process of that deportation? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">How were you notified and what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  My mother went out shopping early in the morning, as a matter of fact, and she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in a hurry and said, "I met someone in the <span class="DLF">street</span> who told me that we would be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Said everybody would be arrested and deported." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">She did not believe it and she went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , which was only two blocks away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And sure enough the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were closed, and then it dawned on her that there was something to this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she told me, "Well, I guess we better start packing." </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And before she had finished the sentence, the police was there and told us that we are arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">No, the first thing she did was, "If we really have to go I have very good friends and I promised them certain items from our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Take them over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Go over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Take it, take it over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Give it to them." </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I went and it turned out that this lady's husband was really German underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He was a lawyer, but he must have been busy in the German underground because he knew exactly where we were going to be taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The man was later on the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> right after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  What's his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  So he was, he was very clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Was Mr. Veit. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">His name was Veit. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They were very good friends of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so I took the items, and by the time I came back the police was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> telling us to pack and, and so my mother started. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And the policeman knew my mother very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He was from the <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And he said to my mother, "I will see if I can get your mother-in-law to stay in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and you cannot be moved out of your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ° Funny war (French); The Phony War. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">until I come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Now he knew very well that no Jewish people were accepted at this particular day in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So he gave us two hours to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So I packed everything for my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">My mother packed for me and for herself and my aunts, of course, packed for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And so six women were eventually guarded by 12 Gestapo and policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Six helpless women. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Right! </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I was 16 and my grandmother was 91 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Totally not comprehending what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Not that she was senile. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It was simply, it was something that was incomprehensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And so we had to sign papers stating how much the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was worth. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My aunt first refused and she was threatened that she would be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and so she signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And we had to leave and we were loaded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> where everybody slowly was assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And I believe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> had some 930 or 950 Jews that were deported together. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">All together from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> and the Palatinate and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Saar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There were some Jews from the Saar that were also deported with us, only a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It was 6,500 people, I believe, that were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">The ride to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> was horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was absolute horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My husband has explained to you, each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> had a person in charge for each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and then someone was put in charge of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They really had nothing to say until the Germans turned us over to the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Why was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride a horror?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  It was a horror insofar as we had no food or barely any food was given to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">For the first time we were given some sort of soup and maybe some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Two of the old people, my grandmother being one of them, lost their minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Most probably due to hunger and the strain and stress and eventually, there was a doctor on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the last doctor that I knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> and he gave me a handful of sleeping pills to give to my grandmother and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And it really meant, “Put her to sleep, let her go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">She didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And at the end of the ride, when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oloron-Sainte</span> -Marie; because she was totally confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So was the other man, a Mr. Weil. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">She was taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and disappeared for at least a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We did not know where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">My mother offered to go, asked if she could go with this old woman and was refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And for at least a week or two we did not know where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We never knew where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">All of a sudden we were told that she was in the next <span class="DLF">block</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">She must have been in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or someplace because when she came back, she was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">She knew us. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">She could not understand her surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Obviously, who could? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But she was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">She was no longer confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So you can understand that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, aside from everything else, was horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">My mother's sisters were -- the oldest was very ill and had diabetes, was in her 70s so the ages were great and having two people in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , not in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> going -- losing their minds the same way was a little tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When we arrived in Oloron- Sainte-Marie, as my husband mentioned to you before, it rained buckets. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It rained. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We were loaded mostly on open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when we arrived, it was evening and, of course, total bedlam and confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And the adults, and we were teenagers at the time, were totally traumatized and in shock and functioned barely. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And so it was on us, the young, to get some semblance of -- you can't say order -- but there was a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they were giving out straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So we ran to get straw so the people at least could sleep on straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">My husband was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He had even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span> or whatever he called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Later on, we were given stuff to put the straw in to make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But the first few nights we had straw and not even enough of that because some people really did sleep on the bare <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And for the very old people it was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">A young person can always shift, but very old people, it is very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So it was the young people who had to function first and did function first. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And slowly, you know, things started to fall into a pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Gurs was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> full of mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It was clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">When it rained, you sank into the clay up to your knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The first persons we lost, or one woman we lost really choked to death in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">She went at night to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">She fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">She could not extricate herself and she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So our experiences were horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It is not -- I would not say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but it was what they called “the Little <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> before the Big One,” meaning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Our food was minimal. </span><span class="sentence" id="231"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was short on food, it is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The French felt called upon to steal much of the money that was allocated to feed us so instead of the little, there was even less. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">There were people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who stole -- were in a position to steal and did of this little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So it was really a very difficult, difficult survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> from, as I mentioned, October 25th, 1940 until the beginning of September 1941.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  What about your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  My mother remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Her two sisters were able to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> and were lucky enough to make their way via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> , <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , and later on to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">My mother was not this lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And she was deported in August of 1942 to -- I suppose, first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">She was the very first transport, or with the first transport, to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">End of July, I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> see my mother who had been very ill and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had given me permission that I could enter for a week to visit my sick mother and they would let me out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And when I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was closed to all visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I saw my mother twice across the barbed wire, an empty <span class="DLF">field</span> and then, of course, wire again so it was a good distance of maybe 150 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I saw my mother twice like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And then I was told that the deportations are starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I was told this by the Red Cross, the Red Cross that was active there, and by the Quakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And that they made arrangements for me to be able to see my mother on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">freight station</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oloron-Sainte</span> -Marie in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And so I went down there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It's about 12 kilometers, I think, 15 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I went down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I spent the night in the <span class="DLF">street</span> between two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on a little -- on a low wall until very early, maybe five o'clock in the morning at which time I was allowed to enter the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> or the <span class="DLF">freight yards</span> really, and I did see my mother and that's the last time I saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And this transport, I think, left, if I remember it right, on August 6, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I went back from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , first seeing my then boyfriend, now husband at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Talluyers</span> , and he told you that we discussed then if there's any danger -- because there was talk about roundups and arrests and deportations even of the people who were living outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- that he should come up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I met my husband in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Let us back up indeed and let us go back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Would you describe -- you are now still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , how did you meet your husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  I met my husband -- Well, let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I worked in the so-called <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Each <span class="DLF">block</span> had, as it was called, ilot*, its own <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for administration purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And his mother was working in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I ran the errands. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I was the messenger. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I distributed mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I did messenger service. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They needed young people to walk through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I did that and this is where I got to know his mother, and when he came to visit his mother, I came to know my husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Did you did you get a chance -- were there any kinds of activities, anything going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> where you and he had a chance to go out and just be together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Go off and be together? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Well, he could come pretty often because he was involved in making music. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">There was a cultural life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">In fact, a very excellent one. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We had a lot of artists, a lot of performers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We had some very outstanding people with us and since he always made music and was involved in a quartet, he had a pass that let him -- and he worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in his <span class="DLF">block</span> -- he had a pass which allowed him to * Block of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> (French) circulate more than other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And so he could come to see his mother more often than other people would have been able to. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And, yes, we would go in the mornings, the Swiss Red Cross fed us breakfast or supplementary food and he would come up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and would wait for me until I would come out of the <span class="DLF">block</span> and then we would walk up there together and have breakfast together and walk back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That was that was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">dating camp</span> style.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  What were the circumstances under which you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  The circumstances under which I left, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> was that a social worker from the OSE” came to see my mother and explained that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> Le Chambon, who was looking to help young people to take them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and would she agree to let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And my mother asked me whether I would want to go, and I said, "Of course." </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And she never said, "But I will miss you. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I don't want you to go," or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">She let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">She loved me enough to let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Because there were parents who did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">You're looking at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">There were parents who did not let their children go. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">As incredible as it sounds, they held on. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">My mother let me go and together with six other young people, teenagers, we set off beginning of September 1941 to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> was, of course, <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , primitive as it was, it still was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The food, of course, was much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">In fact, in the beginning we couldn't eat all the bread that we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Not that it was such tremendous amount of bread, but it was more than we could eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And so we would toast it very, very hard and make little packages and sent it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because our constant worry was what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So we would make, all of us, little packages and sent them. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We would also go and steal maybe a couple of potatoes from the farmers in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and sent them because they had no potatoes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It was an unknown luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So, we would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I would say we were content to be where we were, but the constant worry about the family left behind was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">You saw the documentary by Pierre Sauvage. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">You saw some pictures of very happy looking youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Yes, we were happy maybe and joking and fooling around at times, yes, but always underlying this was the situation we are in. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">The situation of the parent or the other relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It was never hurray, hurray. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Nothing bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Now we come to 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Excuse me my dear before we get to 1942, would you tell about the family with whom you stayed? </span><span class="sentence" id="321">You said you stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Oh, this was a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which was under the hospices of Swiss Red Cross, to be precise, Secours Suisse’. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We were there not just the seven of us who came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but many French children. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">There was with us also Elizabeth, Elizabeth Koenig, née ° Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [Children’s Aid Society] (French) ° Swiss Aid (French) Kaufmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">She was with us for some time, before she was lucky enough to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I think it was February or March of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And we were a nice group of youngsters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  What was your role in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  Well, I was one of those who didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Madame Trocmé’, to this day, cannot understand how it happened that I did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">How her husband let this pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I felt -- I did not speak French at the time, and I felt well, here I am, 17 years old -- almost 17, and they're going to put me in the second graders in order to learn the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">This was my concept of the time, at the time, and so I did not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I had some French lessons by a Mademoiselle Hoefert®, who was a refugee herself and taught at the <span class="BUILDING">College Cévenol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I believe she taught Latin, if I am not mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I had some French lessons from her, and eventually I did pick up the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Mostly so because in spring of 42, I was hell-bent on making some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And first Pastor Trocmé’ talked me in -- or whoever was in charge of that, thought I might be able to work in a <span class="BUILDING">photo store</span> , being that I came out of this line of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And then this was rejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Maybe they felt I would be too exposed in an open <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And I took a job as a maid in a <span class="BUILDING">preventorium</span> that was just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We had there children with TB'” and children who were in danger of getting TB and I worked there for several months until, in fact, I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> to see my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The object was to make a little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">In the bargain, I learned French.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Well, I sort of helped taking care of them, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Guespy</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I did help with the cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I did errands. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I felt maybe being the oldest one, I felt a little bit responsible for them sometimes being the spokesman for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  What did that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  And being the one who would say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Okay?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  Can you describe the daily life in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">What did you all do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  The daily life is that most of the youngsters went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It was a very routine life in a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> if you wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It was a very primitive set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">In winter, we had barely any heat because there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Food was more plentiful than it was somewhere else maybe, but it's still not -- was not very much for teenagers who can eat all day long, incessantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And we somehow fell into a routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The winter was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Again, because we had no heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Water had to be pumped by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The pump froze in. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">It meant we had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We had to go out into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , which was not very pleasant, especially at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">The boys had it easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They opened the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Not so lucky for the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">But we all survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We all made the best of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We were a nice group of youngsters who got along. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Whether it was the French children or it was us, it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We got along.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Talk a little more about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">How did you feel recetved by Les Chambonnais?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Les Chambonnais. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Very Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We felt very much at ease or at least I did, feel very much at ease in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I eventually met some other people, French people, and there was never a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I met once a farmer who said to me, "Even if we had less to eat, we would want more of you people." </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Now this was an absolute reversal of what we had experienced all our lives from the outside world that someone would say even if we have less we want more of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So does this explain to you the attitude of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">In 1942 when the roundup started of the people outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> when I came back we were hidden by the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We first had a confrontation with the Germans at which the Director of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , Mr. Bohny'! </span><span class="sentence" id="415">was extremely clever and diplomatic because we were caught, not in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived, but in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we went during the night in the '' Auguste Bohny-Reiter hope of not being caught at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we stayed, but we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And, of course, they were ready to take us along and Mr. Bohny explained to them that we were under the protection of the Swiss Red Cross, that he was responsible for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And he talked to this man and talked and talked and talked until he finally said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You're responsible for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">We will clear that with our authorities whether this is correct and you make sure that they are not going anywhere." </span><span class="sentence" id="420">After they had cleared out and daybreak came, we left in a hurry and went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and were all day long in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and were picked up in the early evening and were dispersed to various <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I stayed actually on two different <span class="DLF">farms</span> for a total of about four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The <span class="DLF">farms</span> -- each one had an encounter with the French police in one <span class="DLF">farm</span> , we were hidden behind a wood pile which was very cleverly put up in that it shaped was U-shaped up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and you could pull out one bundle of wood and we would crawl in there and sit in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">There was just enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the other girl and myself to sit in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was totally covered up top. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">You could not look in from the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And we were sitting in this wood pile and then you, of course, put this one bundle of wood back in so there was no <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We were sitting in there until they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And your heart beats very fast and very hard and you're scared until they leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">In the second <span class="DLF">farm</span> , again there was the police coming around and there we were hidden in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> behind old clothes with a row of shoes in front of us and we were standing in there totally quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Now, we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">upper floor</span> of this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">The police was downstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And we could hear them ask the farmers, "Do you have any Jews here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And the farmer answering, "What are Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We don't know what that 1s, but would you rather have a glass of wine." </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And we in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> hoped they would say no, because it was a little bit tight in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armoire</span> and so eventually they left and we could come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So we were very, very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And four weeks later, we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">The razzias had stopped for the moment and it also helped me to make up my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Even before that actually, when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> after I saw my mother that as safe as Le Chambon 1s, we need to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We need to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And I told my friends and I told the young people in the <span class="BUILDING">student home</span> Les Roches'*. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There were some friends of my husband there; there was a map on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and I said, "You see where we are here and this is where we have to go," pointing to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and they looked at me like I had lost my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We cannot stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">No matter what, we cannot stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And so eventually, I did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Please, would you tell me about that visit and your part in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">When I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> and the short stop I made to see my then boyfriend obviously having seen my mother deported and the last thing I saw of her was a white handkerchief fluttering out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I don't know whether you can.... No, you cannot understand what emotions you are going through, and I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> and I had to bring a horrible message to my friends because most of their parents had been deported at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And within -- I don't know whether it -- I do not remember whether it was the same day or several days later but it doesn't really matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">There was a get together and I believe -- I cannot be sure anymore -- it might have been in the Céteau Fleuri where Pastor Boegner addressed the people who were there and I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I don't remember who went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It is sort of a blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">He was telling us we should be calm and confident and nothing is going to happen and so on and so forth and after having had the experience that I just had, I just became very angry and I confronted the man and said, "Instead of telling us these things, why don't you do something? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Rather than talking, do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I did not know at the time who Pastor Boegner was. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">He was just another man. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">A man who was giving a speech that to me was totally ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And so I confronted him with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And I don't think if I had known who Pastor Boegner was, I think I would still have done the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  What did he say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  There was no answer as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">What's there to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There was no answer to, to, you know, be calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Remain confident. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">How can you remain calm in the face of what was going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Or what I had just experienced? </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So that was my confrontation with the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant Church</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Next? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Well, then we went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">That was after my confrontation. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Pastor Trocmé was very upset that day with me when I came back that I did not first report to him what had happened and it was really not on my mind to go to him and to tell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I did not realize they had really worried if I ever even would come back and not get caught on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">The thought never entered my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I didn't go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I just didn't see any reason actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Now I know what he wanted to know from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But at that time all I knew is that I had to tell my friends what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">That was the overwhelming feeling and terrible duty I had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And everything else was wiped off the slate. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So, he was angry with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I learned that afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And it really didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">'S Pastor Marc Boegner

<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Well on my way back, as I mentioned, I saw my boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I told him to come up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> if things become difficult where he is because I was sure that there would be help, that he would be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And he did come. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And he told you how he found me on the way walking from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Now I have to think a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I lost my thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">What did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">When I came back out of hiding, I was moved to another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , also of the Swiss Red Cross where there were smaller children. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And I helped for several months to take care of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We had an outbreak in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of lice, head lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Nothing unusual! </span><span class="sentence" id="515">My wonderful job was to clean them up in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Have them all nice and clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Send them off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the next morning, only for them to come back with a new batch, which they picked up in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So, 1t was an evening exercise to clean the children up. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I did that for several months helped with the children, helped with whatever had to be done in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">In the meantime, I was in touch with my family in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">My mother's sister was married in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> since the beginning of the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I made it clear to them in letters; I said I wanted to leave and said I wanted to come and stay with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And they, in turn, found a woman who arranged for crossings into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">What they first did, however, was to apply for a visa for me to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Now I could never use this visa to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> legally as a immigrant because I could not get an exit visa out of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Mr. Bohny had at the time tried to get an exit visa for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I made the application which, of course, was turned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And so I could never physically take possession of this precious visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And so in February of 43, through this woman my family had found, a man was found very close to the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> who would literally take me across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I made my way alone from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annemasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I met this guide in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annemasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">There were three or four, five other people which he crossed at the same time, so we were a group of six that he crossed over into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">His crossing over consisted of carrying us across the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> physically so we would not be wet, depositing us on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and saying, "Now you have to walk in such and such a direction and you will then meet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> that will take you into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , and you get off at a certain <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and there will be a contact person who will take you to a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for the night." </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And this is how I entered <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Once I was on <span class="REGION">Swiss soil</span> , I was perfectly legal, not like my husband who entered as a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So it was a long while my husband had a guide all the way with his friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I had no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Mr. Bohny happened to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when I left the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I did not board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tence</span> which is the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> below. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And he was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; and he went with me as far as, I believe, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And then of course from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">From there on, I was on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> was full of German soldiers because all of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was already occupied at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">This was February of 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Were you accosted in any way on the course of this journey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  I was accosted? </span><span class="sentence" id="548">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Once when I got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I believe, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> I had to show my false identification papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I mean to them -- to me I knew they were false. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">To them, they were supposed to be real. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">There was a guard there, asked everybody for his identification papers, and I showed him and I walked on. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And then when I walked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annemasse</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , there was a little <span class="BUILDING">customs building</span> and I figured well, it's war time. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">This is ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">What customs? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">What traffic can there be between <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and I walked on. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And he called me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And I had to show him my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And then he said, "Are you Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I don't know where the answer came from, but it came as, "I have nothing to do with that dirty race." </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And I really don't know where this answer came from, but it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And he sort of smiled and let me go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">What happened now once you have gotten into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> I was this one night in this little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and I told this contact person to immediately call my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">It was around 11:30 at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">She said, "But it's 11:30 at night." </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I said, "Never mind the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Please call." </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And my aunt came the next morning to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I lived with my family for a year and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  Would you describe the conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> at that time, living in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  Living in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with my aunt and uncle was extremely difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They had absolutely no understanding of what I had lived through, what I had experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They were very nice, solid, extremely well-to-do Swiss citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">People cannot understand really and truly what you went through, and my history is easy compared to what people went through in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> or any of the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So yet, here I was, 18 years old, or a little older, with all of these experiences: having experienced death many times over to some of my -- the people around me, and their life has always been a very bourgeois life. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So how can they understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I was 18, and my uncle was in his 70s so -- and very Victorian. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So right here was a tremendous clash. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And now I was supposed to live the life of the very nice bourgeois girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And so there were many clashes and whenever I did something that was not quite the way it was supposed to be my aunt would say, "What would your mother say?" </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Well, one day I had enough of what would my mother say and I said, "Why don't you leave her alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">She's dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And this was the one thing really that my aunt could not admit and confront because rightfully she had to feel guilty for the loss of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Simply because they had not done enough to get her out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The problem always was money. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So even my life would not have been saved if not my cousin, her daughter-in-law, would not have put them to shame by saying, "How long will you wait or do you wait before you do something and will she have to be lost also before you move?" </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But I didn't know that when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that my cousin at the same time was working on the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">But my life with my relatives was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It was extremely difficult, and eventually I left without permission to leave the city of Bern and took a job as a maid with a Bulgarian family, also refugees, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And at the same time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and I got the job through the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> Mademoiselle de Montmollin, who was running the social -- the course where my husband took social services -- that social services course my husband took. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So here we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  At the war's end! </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  And by 1946, what did you do and where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  Well, in -- well, I had my daughter in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We were in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreux</span> , to be precise, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Territet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I was busy with the baby and again, I came down with a case of pleurisy and I did not do very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">My husband was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I did a little bit of office work, but nothing to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Everybody had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Then came the moment where the Swiss government decided that any immigrant living in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> has to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Now this, of course, applied to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Now what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">You have an infant that can stay in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">My husband is in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but I have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So we rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">It's -- Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I had to take my meals <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">After some length of time, the government decided that I could come back into the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because after all the child was there, and I had to take care of the little one but I would have to pay <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I had to pay <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board at the same rate as the Swiss employees who were running the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- the Swiss administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So, it wasn't much, but it was a lot for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">At the same time, the Swiss government had a very great dilemma. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Namely that our daughter had a refugee father and an immigrant mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">What should the child be? </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Refugee or immigrant? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Now children born in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> are not automatically citizens like they are in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">That does not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So after lengthy discussion, the Swiss decided she should be a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Otherwise, we would have had to pay for her as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So they made her a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Does that tell you how people were harassed? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Unimportant things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  How long did you stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">ANSWER:  We could not immigrate before February of 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">It was a matter of not having an affidavit and my relatives here had to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They themselves did not have enough funds to give an affidavit, so they had to find someone to give us an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And eventually they did; the man gave us an affidavit with the understanding that we would never become a charge to him because you guarantees it if something happens, they take care of you, that the family would. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And under these -- with this agreement, he gave the affidavit and eventually we came here on the 3rd of March 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So we were eight years on the <span class="DLF">road</span> so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Will you tell me a little about settling here, the first years in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  The first years were extremely difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">First of all, our total assets when we came were exactly $90 for the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The first week we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> relatives of ours paid for our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board at the <span class="BUILDING">Stephen Wise home</span> , on the West Side 70s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , but after that it was be on your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And luckily enough, my husband found a job within ten days after coming here, so we had a little bit of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">My husband told you that he went to the HIAS"* to get some help the first few days -- which, of course, was no help. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And, but one of the things they first said before they would help, you have to move out of the <span class="BUILDING">Stephen Wise home</span> and you have to move into one of our <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> which was the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Marseille</span> on <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> and, I think, on <span class="DLF">100th Street</span> , I believe it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It was a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So as soon as we could and my husband was making a few dollars, we moved out of there into another one-room hotel situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And during that summer, my husband got sick and I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And our daughter was first with my relatives upstate for about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And when this episode was over, he found another job and eventually things started to move along a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">In September of -- no, not in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">In November of 1950, I started to hemorrhage during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I coughed and I started to hemorrhage and went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They took an X-ray and here I had a wonderful case of TB, The next step in this situation is, of course, that the family has to be X-rayed, and look here, who also had TB was my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So now we are both sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And here's the little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> social services was very good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">They referred us to the Jewish Child Care’’, who placed our daughter into a <span class="BUILDING">foster home</span> , and at our request she did not stay in the City of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I was scared to death to leave her in the City of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I was afraid that she would be playing in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and no one would properly supervise her and she would get hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So I requested that she be placed outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And so she was placed out on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> with a very, very lovely woman who had taken in foster children for many years, and she just knew how to handle these children and she did a terrific job. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So that was, so that was really two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We were almost away for two years in the <span class="BUILDING">sanatortum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">The child was away two and a half years, and when we came back from the <span class="BUILDING">sanatortum</span> , my husband was enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which came under the rehabilitation program of the State of New York, and he became an accountant and he completed a program in nine months which really takes two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So he worked very hard and studied very hard to do it so quickly so that he could go back to work and earn a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Well, that was our beginning this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Quite a beginning! </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p>
