<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  How did your parents meet each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, my parents met each other -- you -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where they used to live are very close to each other, about six kilometers, I think, or maybe less from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skundaliena</span> and the other was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barovka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And they probably knew each other much earlier than -- before they got married.</span></p>

QUESTION:  And so can you tell us a little bit about your mother’s family and background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My mother was born actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Daugavpils</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but 1t was si -- six kilometers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skundaliena</span> as I mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my grandmother, he -- her name was -- maiden name, Kuperschmidt, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And my grandfather’s name is Hayman. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So where they got married, they had a small <span class="DLF">farm</span> , let’s say maybe 18 acres, s -- a -- a <span class="BUILDING">country store</span> and a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , maybe seven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and th-th-they possess some <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It -- 1t’s unusual, I think for the Jews to possess land, right, in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So they considered themselves more or less well -- well off, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And so my mother actually, since her childhood, she worked in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and worked in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , keep the book -- bookkeeping with her sister and older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Her older brother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Daugavpils</span> and then became a -- a -- a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And she and her older sister and their mother, they -- they ran the st -- the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And my -- on my father’s side, my father was a blacksmith and so they were poorer, much poorer. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And my -- you see, my mother was a foo -- of the so called -- maybe they considered themself intelligentsia or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So she married late, because she was very choosy, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So -- but she realized that my father was a good man and had a -- a head on his shoulders, so I guess it’s how - what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  How religious were your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">February 27, 2000
ANSWER:  This is a peculiar situation because my mother was never a religious woman, and my father was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I remember that on holidays my grandfather used to send a -- a kishen. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We’re talking in Yiddish, but it’s a pillow in English, with a -- with a chicken, you know, ga -- slaughtered chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I do -- even remember the blood in the kishen and the -- a-and the feathers, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And my -- my father tried to have a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , kosher, all of this, but my mother always resisted and sometimes my father was take -- would take a -- a knife my mother used to cut butter and then use it for meat, and throw it out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And this what the situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">You know, so there was a -- you know, I would say, a contrarian interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Of how you call it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  A little disagreement, contention?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  To each other they spoke Yiddish, but to me they always spoke Russian, and we lived in a -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Is -- but -- but in -- in those <span class="REGION">areas</span> , they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Latgalia</span> where people mostly spoke Russian language more than Latvian, because it was close to <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So they spoke Polish, my mother spoke German and my father, of course, spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And my father served in Latvian army too, when he was a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">February 27, 2000
QUESTION:  Did your parents feel that they were Latvian first, or Jewish first? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">What do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  No, it’s hard for me to tell because I was very young, but I can imagine that when you live in a bu -- how it 1s, I -- of course they’re Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">F-Fir -- first and foremost they’re Jewish people, but you’re loyal to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It’s -- it’s why he served in the army, and dealt with the -- in business and everything, it’s -- it -- and he stayed, even -- he’s -- his brother actually left for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1934 to become a chalut, but we stayed in -- now I want to turn off and I want to say something, but I don’t know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Turn off, please. [</span><span class="sentence" id="82">tape break] What -- where did we stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Well, you were talking about this organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yes, you see, in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> there was an organization called [indecipherable] and this organization actually an-anybody could belong to -- to this organization, but -- and my mother and my aunt, and probably my grandmother, I’m not sure, belonged to this organization, [indecipherable] just was a pure Latvian organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I would call it guards, and because you were a property per-person, you should have belonged to this, especially in <span class="REGION">rural areas</span> , that’s what I want to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  An-And did they belong? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">February 27, 2000
ANSWER:  Yeah, they did belong to this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Of course, during the Soviet times it was forbidden and we’d not -- you wouldn’t mention that you belonged to this organization, but if a -- as a matter of survival you would like to belong to this organization, my mother did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Did it require her to do anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  No, it didn’t require, probably only paid dues, and you know, probably only that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  What are your very first memories?</span></p>
