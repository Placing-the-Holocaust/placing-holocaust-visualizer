<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  In 75? </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Where was she during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  She was hiding with false documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">As I mentioned, nobody was looking for her, because was not registered as a freed person, and so she could get false documents and she could hide.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  It was not very difficult because many refugees came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She had also a document as a refugee from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and she just -- I don’t know was recommended or in the newspaper -- she rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">private room</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">family house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The only danger was that somebody recognized her or was suspicious whether she is a hidden Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">If they called the police, and looked after the documents, they are real. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It was very difficult to check whether it was a real document or not because very often it was a real document. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Only from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Did you have to pay a lot of money to get one of those?</span></p>
