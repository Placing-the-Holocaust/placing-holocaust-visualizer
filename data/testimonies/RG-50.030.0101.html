<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  [Born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , April 11th 1929 (phrases missing)] ...small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> considering in con...1n the context of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American cities</span> , it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1">But a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that had a lot of educational uh establishments and the opera would, for instance, come and perform. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Uh I never traveled very much as a child except for the in into the immediate outskirts and I came from a family where there was a great deal of love and a great deal of concern and a great of care and that continued until our total separation which came actually in 1940... in 1941 for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your, about your friends, growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">What was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I have attended a number of different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , probably because my mother and father were looking at what was the best educational outlet rather than a particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> uh which I didn't like terribly much. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">and them my sister and I spent about a year or two in <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">There were only five or six children and we had, strangely enough for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time, uh Hebrew instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">But there was an excellent <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and then after that I attended a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> (ph) and my formal education per se actually was abruptly stopped in my fifth grade level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  What about friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Well, I was - my sister was a great hot-head (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="13">She was a champion - champion skater, champion swimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">She was very musical - played a number of instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I was given piano lessons, ballet lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I was particularly interested in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And during the Russian occupation from 1939 to 1941, uh the Russian authorities go after talent and recognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So they said to my parents, we're not interested in how well she will do academically. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We have discovered that she has a very lovely voice and she's very musical and she dances well and she does very on stage - we are going to overlook her theatrical career. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And so I sang as a soloist at the age of ten with all the major <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">choirs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I designed and choreographed some ballet without knowing anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was just a natural outlet, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Uh I played with a lot of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We would invent some wonderful plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It wasn't a store-bought toy. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We would play <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We would play uh I remember reading a great deal in addition to Pushkin and in addition to the other authors a lot of the movie magazines, and so we pretended that I was greta Garbo and my friend would be Marlena Dietrich and we would just go on that way and get some carrots and potatoes from our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> and pretend that we were homemakers and children and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So we really had a very kind of a free, delightful uh existence, in spite of the fact that the anti- Semitic climate was very strong, very strong, and I was, we were all rather blue-eyed, blonde, fair-hair, so that no, people who didn't know that I belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , that my parents did, that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But there were pogroms, quite a few of them, and I kept asking why, what's what what's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It's very hard for parents to explain because we believe in a different religion or we belong to a to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> rather than a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that people don't like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And so I grew up both on one <span class="NPIP">level</span> uh happily because I was loved and protected and got the best possible education that I could through my parents, and family life was very important and I imagine that kind of upbringing and that kind of rooted embedded uh understanding of my parents that they gave to both my sister and myself, probably helped me a great deal later on to have that base, that strength of knowing who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Without understanding it, without going into other philosophical discussions about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We lived in a perfectly beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Niemen</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh my mother was more religious than my father and we were religious I suppose like everyone else without being fanatic about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And my childhood was really quite free of any worries except for the fact that I started to recognize that there were stones being thrown at our <span class="DLF">windows</span> towards 1938, 1939, and uh I was also told that on Passover which was very beautiful in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my father would, I'm sure to the dismay of my mother invited half of the people who had nowheres to go to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so they could share that special evening with us, that the Christian children were told that the Jews drink the blood of Christian children during the Passover Seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And it was just something that a child, even as an adult I cannot quite comprehend. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But that's the kink for archaic teaching that essentially, eventually with ignorance led to the disaster of the catastrophe of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So when you ask me what was my childhood I can describe it in terms by saying that it was a pleasant, delightful, carefree surrounded by a lot of love and a lot of attention and the hand-writing, even as a child without understanding, were already lingering in the in the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  When did this change? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">When the Russians came, what else happened to you, to your life in addition to the special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Were there any other changes from '39 to '41 that you noticed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Yes, as a matter of fact not understanding what Stalin stood for, not understanding political uh politics per se, I loved being there at that ttme because the pogroms have stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I was indited into what they called the Pioneer, the Young Pioneers Group. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They showered a great deal of attention on the children because that's the way they get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My parents probably were dismayed and couldn't do anything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My father I believe was imprisoned for about three or four months because he must, he was, he must have said - I didn't really know why, but it was obviously for political reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He may have said something that did not please the Communist 1n.. uh people. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Now you have to understand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> is about, I'm not sure that I'm being accurate, but it's about sixty miles from the <span class="DLF">Lithuanian border</span> , or maybe less. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So that entire <span class="REGION">area</span> uh was a changeable <span class="REGION">area</span> geographically. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It was first, my parents were born there or close by and then it was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">When I was born it <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and in 1944 it was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> again, and it is <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So that uh I did not speak Russian until 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I speak Poli...[ spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We spoke basically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something, my sister and I would go get furious about that, and she would speak Russian or French to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And of course at that time I still didn't speak either one of those languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Well, uh <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , the Soviet Union occupied that part of, well, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1939 as we know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Half of it went to the Nazis and the other half, the eastern, the traditional <span class="REGION">northeastern part</span> went to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balystok</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> and that entire <span class="REGION">areas</span> became Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I learned White Russian because that is really Bieloruss and Russian and did a lot of dancing, a lot of uh gymnastics. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My sister was the one who really was known gymnast and I had won quite a few competitions in singing and dancing and they encouraged that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And life seemed perfectly alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And then in September of 1941, uh everything broke and we were hiding in the bonders because the <span class="DLF">air</span> the air raids were pretty severe. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And uh very shortly the following day somebody walked up out of the compound and said we've just seen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Now again, you have to understand I did not understand the idea what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> , what kind of ominous clouds that would sweep around Europe and what it would mean, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> are in front of your <span class="DLF">door</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  What did you do when you heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> , when your family heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">What did you and your family do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  They were very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They recognized because we had known, we did hear terrible stories coming out from the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , people who may, who escaped uh what was happening to the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But again I must say that maybe because I was playing with dolls one day, and the next day I was asked to be a grown-up, it hadn't quite sunk in, what the tragedy of the entire period meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I could only reflect today as I have post- Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">When I was in it I didn't really know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I was we were in a vacuum. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was in a vacuum. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I can only speak for myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  That's what we want to talk about, of course, is what you did and thought then rather than now. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Then what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Did <span class="BUILDING">school</span> continue for example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Not in '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">In 1941 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did not continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It was actually not even the beginning of the school semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Very shortly after, uh we were still in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , within a matter of a few months if I remember correctly, they had two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in, not very far from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And very shortly the entire the entire Jewish population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> was being uprooted from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that I remember very distinctly and with great pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We had some beautiful china. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We had a very lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Wasn't rich but it was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The Germans would come in and simply at the whim of a wisp, just like that (fingers snap), remove the most beautiful china and just throw it against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> to break it, for fun, and started to taunt and tease. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And you didn't really have to be all that young to recognize that this was the devil in the flesh. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We were evacuated to a to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> uptown, my both my father and my mother and my sister and I. Uh my mother was one of three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">One had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the other was married to a prominent professor with three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">One of my cousins was a uh young man who I believe was only 23 but he was considered to be a genius, so much so, electronic, that the Germans used him for two years as what they called a Einutzliger Jude (ph), a useful Jew, and when they have extracted what they needed, they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">His older sister, my other cousin, was a, completed the <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw Conservatoire</span> and was a concert pianist and somehow managed to escape to uh to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alma Ata</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> [NB: <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">The younger of the three cousins uh stayed with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Because my uncle was considered in High Intelligentsia they have, they rounded them up and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">When were in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I believe my cousins, my cousin, just my aunt and my, my and her younger daughter were with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We had improvised <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> meaning that we still believed that the world may not have gone altogether and that we will need an education, and so we continued with our studies on an improvised basis by having the teachers who were there get the children and get them together. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Uh I'll tell you something rather interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My father worked as a forester. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That means that he was a specialist in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and primarily worked with peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="106"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is known for beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He was extremely well liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He was, I remember my father more often on a horse in a leather cap in a leather jacket and leather boots riding on either - we had two horses, a white one and a grey one. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on day and said that some peasant families said let me have your children for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They are both very light. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They don't look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Why don't you let us have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We will hide them for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I remember having a little conference and both my sister and I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">If we cannot be together then we're not going to be without you. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">In November of 1942 the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where I was with my family got split up. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They were obviously starting the evacuation process to the many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that we didn't know anything about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Can we hold it for one minute, (Sure) and I'd like you to describe the life in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">What was your daily life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You mentioned <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">What else was going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  With all due respect I cannot be absolutely clear and remember it to that extent except that it was bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was bearable to the fact that my parents were with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">My sister was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We tried to improvise and play. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I'm sure my parents felt differently because I was so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And because I was so young I didn't stop to think what is going on except that somehow we were not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with many other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh life was no normal, but we were still a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And then very abruptly, as they usually do those things, and for me - I don't know what go what went on with the with the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where they the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> - as I said we were in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> - they probably started to, in fact I'm sure they started to evacuate because this was already in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">No doubt that the Jews who were in the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had already been evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But this is the <span class="REGION">eastern part</span> and they you know they had to start a whole new program. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Uh they rounded us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We had no idea why. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I had no idea why. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Maybe the others did. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My parents and I, my sister and I and my parents were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">My sister and I were taken to, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto number one</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We had no idea what happened to our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I had subsequently learned that the transport, that was, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they were in a way entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as most of them of course did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My sister and I remained in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">That was already very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was it was wintertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The selections were, in other words the evacuation process began quite earnestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We work in a in a <span class="BUILDING">tobacco factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My sister and I would share a kind of little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> in somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ____ the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> belonged to a friend of mine who, they were no longer there, and we were, we managed to hide every time, like maybe three or four selec...uh not selections because they weren't all called selections but the raids - in other words to find the Jews to send them to wherever they were sending them - we didn't know where - we managed to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we continued to give ourselves some kind of moral support by saying look, we'll probably leave here and I'm sure we'll be with our parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But, on January probably the 18th or 20th, somewheres around there, 1943, we hid behind very heavy snow behind the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which is where they would run, round everybody up and we could no longer hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We were found and walked to the to the to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and what was so dreadful and I remember that - I did not see Shoah but the told me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The people were standing and watching as the people, as their neighbors - I don't know, I didn't recognize anyone but were being obviously dragged without too much clothes, without any necessarily private possessions, to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And then we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And that's when the reality set in but I still had no idea that a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That they were still doing the actually burning people. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My sister gave me my mother's coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">A long coat, and I think that coat may have been responsible for my going into the camp rather than to the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My sister was very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">She was very cleaver. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">She was absolutely wonderful, tremendously liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Her name was Sala (ph) and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was probably one of the worst things that I can possibly remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was utterly horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">People died. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There was no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There were no sanitary facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Whatever was had gone very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It was about three and a half days. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And then we stopped and we saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And we said I bet you we're going to meet our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Well, we were right to some extent, except that we didn't meet them. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">During the time that we were that we came down, in other words we were at disembarked or let from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , Sala said to me, don't speak, don't move, let me think for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We were about twenty-five hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I have a book by the way, from somebody from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> who had just published the entire history of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> and it's the most incredible thing is that even my number is mentioned there, so that I learned something about - I mean as I said, there are (ph) these are documentations that are there because there was a trial of the Nazis of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Maybe I was very dumb or just very young, but I didn't understand or knew as much as many other people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">When we embarked my sister noticed that the majority of the people from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were being pushed to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and a rather small group was being pushed to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , both men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">She said don't ask any questions, just walk over to that small group, and she followed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And the guard the guard said, Genoch. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">There were eight-five women and a hundred and twenty men out of something like twenty-five hundred who were then brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The rest went directly to the crematortum. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Now we didn't know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But after one day you did know because the, at that time uh when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> which was January, January 24th, 1943, the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> were very high and the smell of flesh was very prominent, and you no longer could pretent that this is the place where we're going to meet our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So this was my introduction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And I suppose you want to know what happened and I will tell you briefly...
QUESTION:  Let's slow down a little. (</span><span class="sentence" id="186">Alright.) </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Uh tell me when you arrived into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , where were you taken and what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  I was taken, we were taken to a <span class="DLF">block</span> , I don't know exactly where. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We then were asked to undress completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I had some photographs of my family which were torn to shreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Hair was completely shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And a rather painful tatoo was put on my left forearm. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">My sister knew my terrible fear of doctors as a child, I don't know why, and she kept whispering to me, be brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And my number was 31386, and her number was 31387 and in those days they gave the numbers smack in the front of the left forearm, not <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I think they ran out of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> or ran out of numbers or maybe they recognized that perhaps it is not such a good idea to be quite so prominent about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">For your information I had it plasmically removed uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Not because I don't want to remember but because I don't always wish to talk about it, or to talk about it perhaps 1n an interview such as this where it has meaning and it has a realistic archival uh value for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Alright so we were stripped and the hair was shaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ...uh Russian prisoners of war and taken to some <span class="DLF">block</span> and that was the beginning of two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  Tell me, who was...
ANSWER:  I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They were speaking all different languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I did not know German. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I did not know Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Actually the Hungarians came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Mainly I think the people at that time were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Uh possibly Czechoslovakian but I really am not totally sure so I can't tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Of course later on you know, day and night became, time had no meaning at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But it was dreadfully hard because the winters are very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Uh the mud - when it rained it was just muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Uh food was unbearable if you were - you eventually learned to eat that but it was uneatable really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  What did you have to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  I think, you know the fact 1s and I, my sister and I used to joke because my mother and my father would make me eat like so many parents you know, drink your milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">You know, here's a piece of chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Uh I'll take you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The bribery aspects because I was very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">In fact I was the youngest of everyone and the mo..the sickliest of everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Finally they thought I had some kind of a heart condition which may not have been true but my parents were very protective of my health so I wasn't allowed to plant <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> which I wanted to do and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And this is the irony that I am the one who survived and my sister who was never sick in her life died three months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Uh and I was glad that she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I will tell you in a minute why I say that in such candor. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Uh we were going to work - these were probably the most horrendously difficult months, the first three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">If you survived the first day, maybe you survived a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">If you made it through the week, chances are you might make it to the second week. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Time had no meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We were very shortly put to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , carrying very heavy stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But the most horrendous part of it all, there was a man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> who name was Tauber (ph) and I eventually asked uh Wiesenthal whether he knew what happened to this pretention of a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And finally he was caught and or he died anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But I remember him very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He was in charge of the selections as people would come back from a very long and a very difficult and a very hungry day. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">You were made to jump five feet over a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> if you, and many didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It you made, if you were able to jump across, about five feet or maybe more, I don't know, then you were OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">If you didn't then you never went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I mean this was a little play. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Cruelty in its most perfect form. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And that went on for quite some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">During that time my sister once put her hand in her pocket because it was freezing, and I never will forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I heard the tremendous slam of a whip on her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Uh the officer, uh one of the guards said don't you every do that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">In other words you're not allowed to put you hands because you were frozen to death in your packet. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Uh Sala one day complained of not feeling very well, and she says I don't think I can get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was a Friday, and I said I don't care whether you can get up - you've got to get up, because if you don't they will take you to <span class="BUILDING">Block 25</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">You know, you become very wise very quickly and you learn to know what Black 25 1s because when you would pass by you would see dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">That was a daily sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Nobody you know, you don't even cry anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">There are no tears left. (</span><span class="sentence" id="247">Cough) Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But Sala couldn't go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">She probably had typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I mean it took - Sunday night she was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">She didn't go to work on Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I went to see her in this <span class="BUILDING">Block 25</span> or <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> - whatever that was, sad as it was - on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">On Sunday I came to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">That was April the 10th. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So here is a beautiful, brilliant, talented, healthy, athletic eighteen year old girl, delirious...with fever looking at me and she says I have to get up because tomorrow is the birthday of my sister and I didn't get her anything and I held her in my arms and she died in my arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Watching this incredible drama was I woman that I did not know she...came up to me and she said in German, which I did not understand very well then - she said I don't have any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I'm not married, but if I had a little girl, I would like her to look just like you and be just like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Martha had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> three months before we had arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">She was a nurse by profession, an operating room nurse, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at that time she was carrying dead corpses which was - she witnessed this incredible little drama and she said ___ (ph) - don't worry little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I will take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Martha was about twenty years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And take care of me she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">She saved my life about four or five times. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Four from the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> and others when I was deathly ill with typhoid or God knows that else, and she would steal injections and save me that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So Sala died and I cried very bitterly that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And then years came and went by before I cried again. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I just did not cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Once you let your defenses down, you're done. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">People say you know, you're very strong and I said that's bull. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">What does 1t mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">How do you practice the art of survival anyway? </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It's not a question of strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You don't even know what's happening to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">What it is a sort of self, self-discipline by saying if I'm going to make it, I'm going to retreat from all that and emerge in a way into my own fantasy world. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And it's very healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I have subsequently done quite a bit of reading in my studies, in my undergraduate and master's programs in various psychology books, a lot of which by the way I do not agree with, and Bruno Betelheim idea was something that I really could not agree with. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The survival, the guilt of survivors - I don't have guilt for surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I was guilty - I said why am I the only one but can one question God or nature or fate? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I don't know but this whole idea that one is guilty because one survived - it's not guilt - 1t 1s something else, and I don't think it's guilt at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But the idea of fantasy is a very healthy idea, even today when things become a bit difficult and I am alone - I am at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> everywhere, and I'm <span class="BUILDING">home</span> nowheres. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It's my, my life has been so totally uprooted at such an early stage that I have never been able to say this is the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> I feel <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I can feel <span class="BUILDING">home</span> everywhere, or make my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anywhere and be perfectly comfortable about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But to come back to your original question, uh Sala's death was very painful because she was a tremendous moral support for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She was my older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">She and I recognized that we will never see our parents again and I knew exactly what happened to my parents and I still am to this day don't want to know or think that hopefully they were not conscious when they were thrown into the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And I had worked there for three months uh sorting the clothes of those who went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Uh I continued to work and then eventually uh I don't know how - [ really can't tell you - I transferred to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was, this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">When I talked about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> the way we know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where some of the medical experimentations were done etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">but the camp where or where, I don't know, I think two and one half million Jews were slaughtered, some were Christians, but for different reasons - and that's just as terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I was transferred I think to Lager C and then I was made what they call an___. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">There were no children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> by the way when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">There were I think five children because they only took the healthy, like say from eighteen to about thirty-five and so on, and I was really not. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">As again how I made it I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">That's something I can never understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">When I was in selections, which were all the time, and Mengele looked at me because I was so very fair, but anyone who came from the north whether you were Swedish or whether you were Norwegian or Polish, if you just happened to be light then you were light whether you were Jewish, Christian or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">He looked at me and I remember his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">He ways are you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">What, first of all, not only my number but I had a little triangle that indicated that was even, you know, put salt on the open would. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Were your parents Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I says Umeglish (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Someone said shut up. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Don't you know this guy conducts experimentation of all kinds, experiments of all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He may want to do something to find out what, whether your blood 1s different from that of a Christian child. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I didn't ... but I was exposed to a great many and again without having any kind of understanding whatsoever why I was spared, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">On on four occasions I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But I was very very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I couldn't walk and I was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And again uh Martha uh smuggled me into the <span class="BUILDING">Christian hospital</span> - when I say <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I mean the <span class="DLF">block</span> where only the Christians were - the Jews and the Christians were often not together. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And put about seventy-five different dresses on me because they all worked in the cre...you know in the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> where you could get those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But I couldn't walk because I had probably typhoid or whatever, and they would inject me with glucose or whatever else they could their hands on to keep my strength up. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I was fourteen by then, look like ten, and one day kline (ph), Dr. Kliner or whoever else was there came in, took down my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Now we knew, we knew that once your number had been taken - that's the kiss of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And there wasn't even a question of crying - you sort of accepted the fact that you are going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And you lived with that death. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I have to interject something right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Later on in my professional life as a singer, I studied for one of my concerts a beautiful song by Franz Schubert (ph) to the poetry by (ph) Klaudius called (ph), death and the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">When death appears as friend, he says come, give me your hand, you sweet and lovely maiden - don't be afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I am your friend and I will take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Well, later on when I studied that song it became extremely meaningful because I was praying for that kind of a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">During one of these, during that time when I knew that I was not going to be here tomorrow, the woman who was in the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was a student of Sigmund Fraud, somebody who was a well-known psychiatrist and she was also a she died...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">This 1s now in the <span class="BUILDING">Christian hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  This is now 1n the <span class="BUILDING">Christian hospital</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="330">Thank you.) </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And I dreamt something quite incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And I told her about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I dreamt that I was walking on a very high <span class="DLF">precipice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I had very long blonde hair that mother used to do like you know Shirley Temple style and I was wearing a white and pink dress that was that was like a it was purely, it was a dream - I was walking and it was kind of moving around and I knew I knew that when I would that I was walking towards the end and there was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I would have to fall and die. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I kept going anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Now I couldn't walk in those days mind you, but I was sort of running. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And as I approached that enormously steep <span class="DLF">precipice</span> somebody jolted me and I woke up and there was Martha standing in front of me with tears in her eyes and she said my Kindchen (ph), little girl - a miracle just happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We have been able to erase your number from Kline's list and you are not going to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I told it I mean I didn't understand what psychology was. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I had no idea who Freud was you know I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Uh I thought reading Anna Karenina under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was something forbidden you know because uh and she said that was a very revealing dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">She says you are you have predicted your own future without even knowing it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That happened a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I was made __ meaning messenger. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And because of that, because I was young and because at that point you sort of I don't know - they just accepted me there I guess...
QUESTION:  We are now back in Lager C...
ANSWER:  Oh, we were in Lager C all the time, but there were different aspects of the "life", quote, unquote, in Lager C. During Lager C times there was a woman by the name of Irma Grese who was very frightening to be around. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">She was extremely beautiful, dressed as cleanly as you can possibly, you can see you could see your face 1n her boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">She was always with an enormous German Shepherd and a whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And I was really very frightened of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Everybody was. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">She would sick her dog on a poor inmate for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And the dog would just about demolish that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Very peculiar things kept happening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">One evening, well evening - I don't know - one late afternoon after, we were never allowed you know we had our great big meal - stale bread and maybe a piece of salami and some horrible smelling coffee, then you could not go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">That was curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Someone, the head of the <span class="DLF">block</span> _____ of the woman who was in charge of our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> who was always an inmate, came up and she said uh Grese wants to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now I did not know that and I didn't even know what homosexuality was but apparently she was a lesbian and because almost everyone there was five or six or seven years older than I was, and she and people said, oh boy, shall we kiss you goodbye you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">God knows what is what it is that she wants to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I walked into the that little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and there was this Irma Grese standing 1n civilian clothes and I must tell you she looked like a vision out of another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">She was wearing a yellow coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Her hair was blonde and usually she was it was always very tightly pulled back. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Her hair was long, let loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">She wore perhaps a little lipstick - I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But she was wearing a yellow coat and she smiled at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Imagine! </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I was frightened to death, and she looked at me and she said, I'll never forget that conversation - you know, I have forgotten a great deal purposefully because you can't live with all the memories, but there are some things that kind of stand out and she said uh, come her, come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">She took my little cheek and she said, ah ha. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">She said they tell me that you look a lot like I, and I wanted to be sure that was really true. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I in my total natvest said, oh I said, I don't think there's any, I've never seen anyone more beautiful, and I meant it. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I mean she was like a vision. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">You know, you have to understand we haven't seen anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">The woman took a liking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Thank God she never did abuse me, but she made me stand guard in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> while she would make love to the most beautiful Jewish girls there. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She also gave me an extra piece of salami and made me uh do her boots or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">In other words, she sort of took a slight liking. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I then found out to my horror when I was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and bought the book called "The Belsen Trials," which is really the Auschwitz trials, Kramer and Hoess, that she was one of the five people who were actually executed for her crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">She was twenty-three years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  What did you know of her role in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">She was SS...
ANSWER:  Oh no, she was (or did yu know’) she was more, yes, I don't know whether SS - I don't know she probably were. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">This was a, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guards, such as Grese and a commandant like uh Kramer (ph), they were of a different breed of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">They looked human, but these were not human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They, you, people, humanity as we know it, even in the worst possible way, cannot behave that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">There's a predisposition, there's a pre- election to the kind of evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They must have been chosen for the very fundamental and the mental qualities that these people possessed to be able to perform and do what these people did, because "normal", quote and unquote, people who are, who have sensitivities and uh and human qualities per se in the smallest quality cannot possibly behave in that manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">She was one of the those. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Now she could be perfectly lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">She was nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But it may have been a little toy to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I mean you know, that I didn't have a relationship with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Uh she was in charge of Lager C. She was, she had total power. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">She could do anything she wanted to anybody at anytime because she was the, I forget the German word, ober... something or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Head, head guard person, and that's all documented, and I as I said I bought the "The Trials" after the war when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and read it studiously in horror - to read my own my own history so to speak, because I lived in a in a little vacuum, not really knowing that in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> other things were happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  What did standing guard for Irma Grese?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  I beg your pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  What did standing guard for Irma Grese?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  You mean as far as I was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Well I was told that she that she was a lesbian. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I did not know in those days what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And that she was making love to another woman and would I stay guard to see that maybe other Germans would be coming or other guards of her caliber would be coming along and she wanted to be alerted. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">That's what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Not all the time - sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  To your knowledge, did she injure or kill the women that she made love to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  That I don't know, but she injured and killed an awful lot of women period. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">She had close to I mean thousands of people that she had tortured, but I don't know whether that was done during her uh tryst or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I doubt it but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">That I can't I can't tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  Did you, can you describe any other indicates with Irma Grese, her behavior with other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Yes I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">When we would have what the called the Zel (ph) appell, that means that in the morning the roll call would take place, and because I was (ph), that means that I would be there to deliver messages to the central off...to the <span class="DLF">central block</span> , to the commandment, or to anybody and bring it back to the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Uh she would make us stand for hours at a time in freezing horrible weather or very hot, depending __ I was one of the - I still don't understand - I was there for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Uh I have told people when the they used to ask me what my educational background 1s, I said I have a Ph.D. from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">That covers a lot of ground doesn't it. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The world really doesn't, the world is not really that interested from the human end. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">There are always those who are. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The majority still have really no idea what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It's too painful to grasp and they can't be bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But Irma Grese would let us stand for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">People would faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She would trod on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">She would beat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">She would sick her dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">She would punish people very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">She was very cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">She was extremely cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They did not execute, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> did not execute many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">A great many people were put into many different sentences, prison sentences, but they executed her, so they must have had far more evidence than I'm giving you here today, documented but from my own personal experience that is precisely my recollection, except that she was, I didn't realize that she was twenty-three. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Age at that point didn't really mean terribly much, but she was twenty-three years old which seems pretty extraordinary to have reached the power of such depth of degradation at such an early age and so she was executed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  You have mentioned that you were in selection with Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Can you describe one of those selections for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">What was so striking and in fact everything that I'm saying to you today is sort of in retrospect how weird those events were. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Mengele never raised his voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He would simply stand there with this finger, and this meant one thing and this meant another thing, and he says, you know you've really lived long enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I think its time to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">In that kind of a manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I never heard him raise his voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">He didn't have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">He relished and enjoyed every moment of his glorious power. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So you see, when you think of Mengele, which 1s unbelievable, this is a monster. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">This 1s a medical doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">When you think of Kline (ph), when yu think of the great minds in a sense, educated people, the crematoria as I've mentioned in some of my speeches when I, the few times that I do speak subjectively, and this is one of the few times that I do, the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> were built, were designed and built not by idiots, not by people who didn't know what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But by highly educated, trained Ph.D.'s who knew exactly what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And they designed that whole "Dant'es Inferno" - you know, there's a <span class="DLF">line</span> in "Dante's Inferno" that says Lachate Oni Speranze Voiche (ph), that means abandon hope all ye who enter here. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Now when Dante wrote this in his inferno, he must have been thinking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or places like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Or people like Mengele or like Kramer, like Hoess, like Grese and like so many other whose names I don't exactly remember - we were not formally introduced. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The other thing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that I remember that helped me is to have a sense of humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Some people say how can you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">If you cannot laugh at yourself, you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">By the way, that's true of today too. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">People who take themselves very seriously are bores (ph), but when you have to, when you do not have a sense of humor during that time, and you really recognize the depth of the tragedy around you, you can't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You see the mind can still function. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It can overcome all kinds of extraordinary circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So say, he, I'll see you tomorrow on the soap board. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And that sounds horrible doesn't it? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But the truth is that as you know, they would make all kinds of, I mean the Germans, the Nazis I should say, were very cleaver as to what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They wast...wasted nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Everything was a must for fortunes of war, and the fat would be used for certain productions including soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Now it sounds horrible today. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It sounds depraved. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But at that time it was a way of saying we know what's going to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">There's nothing we can do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So let's laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  On that note, let's hold it for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Let them change tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I need a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Tape #2 (Tape snag - technical conversation)
QUESTION:  Uh you had described several times that Martha helped you a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Can you describe other incidents uh other than the one in the <span class="BUILDING">Christian hospital</span> where she helped you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Well I was first in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Well, I, the hos...the word <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> 1s incorrect. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It's fallacious. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There were no <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">There was a <span class="DLF">block</span> where you went if you were sick and if you were Jewish which that means you never came out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Martha worked with the doctors because she was a nurse and somehow she was able to man...to get medicine, injections which she uh was able to administer to me which kept me alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Uh the Christian inmates 1n the in the <span class="BUILDING">Christian hospital</span> were allowed to get packages from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and would share some of the goodies from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with me because I was the child you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I was that little girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Uh and then on a few occasions Martha actually was able with the help of someone else to remove the number that was written down for me to go pastures 1s the only way you can put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Uh something that the normal mind and I say, when I say normal mind I mean people who thank goodness, thank God have not experienced my adolescent years, would find it extremely difficult to grasp. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Maybe people who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Viet Nam</span> might to some extent understand that when you walked out in the morning for the roll call, you would literally see hundreds of emaciated bodies still warm, piled up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and you didn't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It was like you are in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and that's part of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">When I think about it today I said how is it possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It's beyond me. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It is a question, when people say how did you survive, I haven't got the foggiest idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">There is no earthly reason in the world why I was chosen to talk to you today. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Maybe there is some plan that the heavens, God, whatever, that I'm here. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Maybe to bear witness, and that is why I have set my own feelings aside, which 1s not easy, to uh to share with you some of my own remembrances so that perhaps those, the people or the children or whoever is going to perhaps hear what I have to say today, will recognize that the madness that 1s in our society today Neo-Nazis who say that the Holocaust never happened, that this is the pure imagination of the Jewish community, will know that uh theirs is a dangerous pack, and the Holocaust did not only happen but it's a very living reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  I there anything else about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , before we move on, anything more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that you want to add or to tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  The only way I can describe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is it wa the de...de...de...deepest dissension of what we considered in our wildest imagination, for <span class="NPIP">hell</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="498"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was the final the final apocalypse. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It cannot be described really. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Even I who was there for twenty-four months, have difficulty, and I'm sure that I have deliberately forgotten quite a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I don't think I could function as a as a human being and be as an accomplished in many way and continue on with life if I had to live and remember what happened to me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And I think again here the mind works some miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It was, you remember what 1s essential, but you sort of forget all the other - it's like having a baby - you remember the beauty but you don't remember the pain, because other wise no woman would ever have a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Uh and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was something, it was the cradle of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It gave people who were deranged the absolute perfect opportunity to exercise their wildest macabre behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Under what circumstances did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  Actually I didn't leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I was evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I was there until the last bitter moment, excuse me (cough). </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Before I answer you that question I just want to say something which I find very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Yes, there were many other people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , Christians, political prisoners, uh prostitutes, homosexuals, uh murderers, but I want people to understand one very important thing - it was primarily an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> of the Jews of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Because the Christian inmates were not subjected to the same treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They were not subjected to uh to <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">If they "sinned" (quote, unquote) according to them, they were hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I don't know that there were any selections for the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">They were there were any selections for the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">They were there as criminals and treated as such as though it was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">A terrible <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> of Europe were made for one reason and one reason alone and that is to - I don't want to use exterminate - it was, you exterminate cock roaches - for the murder of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And six million died, not just in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> - in others. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I think that's very important to understand. (</span><span class="sentence" id="522">Thank you.) </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I have primarily spoken to Christian groups in my short few years that I have decided that I had a responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I wanted to speak to the Christian community, to make them understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Now, I left, or I would say I didn't leave - I was evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on January 24th, - I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , excuse me, I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on January 24th, 1941, and evacuated on January 18th, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">That was another terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We actually went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and saw a leveled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">By that time I spoke fluent German, fluent -you see I did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there - fluent German, fluent Hungarian, fluent Czechoslovakian, and fluent Italian I mean - there were so many people from all over the world, and I wound up in a dreadful <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  How did you get from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  By <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I don't know how many days it took but counting was not one of those things that we did there. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It was by that time the end of January, maybe two weeks later, maybe ten days after - I really don't know, but it was in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="532"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> was built for x amount, like maybe thirty-five hundred people, and at that time we were there were something like fifteen thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It was dreadful, horrible, and extraordinarily - I met Martha there, and she said to me at that time, if anything happens and either one of us is alive, I want you to meet me in such and such a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And she's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">She's in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> , and I went to see her in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">She's quite ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">She has never recovered from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I guess she must be about seventy-five now perhaps - I don't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Uh but anyway after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> of which I have a blur because it was terrible, and like typical Martha, she shared her slice of bread with me and still reprimanded me because I, I mean she sort of imagined herself that I was her little girl, and then...
QUESTION:  Do, don't don't go by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> even if its a blur quite so quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  I would say about three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  What, through the blur, can you remember, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Masses of people, death, terrible starvation, no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We didn't work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">It was, there was there was some chaos at that point, and don't forget this is January '45 and I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in fact had already been liberated by the Russians, and we were just, kept going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I can't tell you too much about it because as I said I remember being uh praying let's get this out, I don't want to live anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I mean, you know, you can't go on like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I knew there was no one left as far as my family was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I knew there was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Uh I don't know what happened to Martha after that because we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And then again we were put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and ridden further into what was still the remaining of the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I wound up in a camp called Retzof-am-Richlin (ph), which was apparently not originally a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It was a camp that was built for the men or the women who worked adjoining uh there was a very large <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they I was told they manufacture the uh the missiles that eventually devastated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and so that it was a much more relaxed camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">There were no <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Uh it was already confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I mean this was already like you know beginning of February, end of January, February, March, April - I was there actually until, perhaps I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> longer than that because I think I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzof</span> for about three and a half months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for us? </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Where were you taken first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It was not the same procedure that was both either at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Uh we were brought on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> 1n fact, not on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were quite sure they were going to shoot us because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzof</span> is surrounded by many <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Uh what struck me about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was that it was relatively nice, meaning that it was not, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">They were much more, they were much bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Uh it was smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">There may have been maybe two thousand, twenty-five hundred people, mainly women. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I don't remember seeing men there. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">It was much looser in discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">How did that manifest itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  How do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  You say it was looser in discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">What did that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  It meant that uh they'd fill up, the behavior of the guards was not as obnoxious and as scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They were primarily men, German soldiers, rather than women. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Women could be terrible, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The women in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were horrendous, the German women. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">There were to my recollection no women. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> , but there were mainly men who were the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The commandant was not as scary as I remember say Hoess Ora Kramer. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">The majority of the pe...the workforce, we worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> where we would uh chop wood for the war production because again this was around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we never felt by the way that we would get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We were quite sure that we were going to be shot, that they could not let, not everyone had a number - not that many were out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but some of us were. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">In fact the majority really. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There really are not that many who have that kind of a number as I do because uh - don't ask me why. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Providence. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Je ne sais pas. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So that Retzof particularly after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I mean you could, and again they asked me what did I do - I mean what, everybody sort of did something if you survived that long, my God, you know, what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Said I was a loifering (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Oh good, we need a loifering (ph) here. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So immediately they gave me that bandanna with the gothic letters and I became a loifering (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="594">That means that I could go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and sometimes they, the German woman in charge would throw me an extra piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I didn't need very much in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I think that may have also, I really think that may have contributed somewhat to my survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">As a child I didn't need much food. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I didn't, I did not eat very much there, and so much so that when I eventually came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and my aunt was very concerned because I could go three days without eating, and she took me to the <span class="BUILDING">Valley Hospital</span> for some tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They found that my stomach had shrunk very considerably. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I simply was not accustomed to sitting down and eating a normal meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I still can't do seven courses in on in one evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I have tried to justified, to justify why I and why not somebody else, and it's not the guilt in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">It's the questioning, why, and I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">It is absolutely against all odds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  Can you tell me, what did you do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzof</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Did you work and what was your work in addition to being a loifering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  Primarily I was a loifering which means that I stood in front, inside the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and be ready to be at any body's beck and call from the main Block Fuhrerstube (ph) or the guards who needed something, or bring their supper or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And then I worked for a while in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with the other kommando chopping <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> which was a little heavy work, and that's basically what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">There was, there were other things there. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">There were mis...uh seamstress who were doing some clothes correction I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">As I said this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had different things but you have to understand again, I wish I could be more descriptive to you as to what, how and when, but I really can't because I can only tell you from my memory what I did when. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I really don't know - there were so many other aspects. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And we didn't exactly share the information on what was going on five blocks away, so that a great deal of my information about, not about my own subjective experience, but about the entire tragedy of the catastrophe I learned by reading about other peoples' accounts and by reading historical and documentation of that nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  We of course are going to focus here on you. (</span><span class="sentence" id="616">Right.) </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Uh, can you tell us of uh, do certain things that went on in the camp or in your experience, stand out in your memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  Yes, It does. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">In fact, what stands out in my memory even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , was that humanity was not lost among the among the survivors, among - I shouldn't say survivors, among the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">People did care for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">People did give each other moral support. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">People did commensurate with each other and tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">There was very little because people were dying and the suffering was so intense that it was very difficult to give strength to someone else, but Martha is a perfect example. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">There were a few others who extended a helping hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But the one incident that comes about me 1s a very unusual one. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">and a very far-out sort of an incident because it came from a German soldier in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzof</span> -am-Richlin. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">There was a young nineteen year old guard who very shortly after I arrived there, started look at me very differently, and I didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">He, eventually we spoke, we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">He was actually from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">He was a medical student. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">He was brought in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He said to me, what are you doing here, the first time I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">He was a guard standing on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffold</span> with a gun, and I was down here standing and he started to sing me a little, a little German song. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I thought boy, this guy has a real sense of humor, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And he said listen, what are you going here? </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And he didn't say it in an angry way. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And I thought to myself, he's crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I said, well, I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And he apologized and he said, he was obviously very green. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">He didn't realize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">He said look, I knew what was going to the, I knew what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with the Jewish community, but I am, I was a medical student until just a few months ago, and I had no idea to what extent the brutality went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I am only now learning from the older guards who talk about it with relish, and I go out and I vomit. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">This young nineteen year old medical student, SS guard because they needed new people to they brought anyone in, Rumanians, Bulgarians, eventually within a few months, was willing to risk his life by saying to me, you are not going to survive because they will kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">This, the rumor goes around that they will shoot everybody here. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">They can't, they don't want to whatever is left, they can't let, leave that much evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I have contacted a woman in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who lost her husband and two sons and is very bitter, told her about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">She says she will give me civilian clothes and I will take you there when there is a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I promise you. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And I said why are you doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">He said because I love you. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Now you have to understand that here was a Jewish girl, sixteen years old, speaking to a German, to a man wearing a German uniform saying I love you and I'm not going to let you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I'm going to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I said we can both hang for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Don't say a word to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">It's a long story which I will not go into now, but I was Very...
QUESTION:  Please, do go into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  Well he was very, well, he was very, he was incredibly tender. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">He asked me to join the kommando because he wanted to tell me more about it and the he says, speak to the commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Everybody eventually winds up going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and working there, and he'll let you, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I was scared to death, but the commandant knew me and he said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You can rotate with other girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">As I said, this was a little more human. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">You simply didn't go to a commandant and stay, do you mind if I go work some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">This is just not the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And Lucien had all the plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">He was incredibly tender. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">He was incredibly beautiful, and I said what is going on with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">What is happening here? </span><span class="sentence" id="668">How, you mean there is still a heart beating under somebody who is wearing a German uniform? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Here was a Christian boy and a Jewish girl caught up in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and this, and I must admit I didn't know, I mean I knew that nature was beginning to play havoc with me, but I didn't know what the word love is or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I mean I didn't know that one does, that there are normal emotions which nature was letting me know were happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">One night he said, very abruptly and very angrily, while he was there, he says I want my supper in my in my Block Fuhrerstobe tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Bring it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So I brought the tray, and I knew there was something wrong, and I walked into the Block Fuhrerstobe. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">There was bedlam there. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">This was already April - I don't know maybe April 20th, maybe April 25th. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And uh I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and there he was standing without a gun and without a tie, the white shirt opened slightly, without his cap and I knew something was terribly wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">He said put down the tray. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">He said we've just got we've just got word that we have to evacuate like immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Tomorrow morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I cannot help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I cannot bring you out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But I pray to God that you're going to live, because I'm going to find you. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And he gave me a magnificent poem and a photograph of himself in civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It was the most bizarre thing - it was like a like a like icing on a on a cake of some kind that was just, what's going on here. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Well, to cut a long story short, we were evacuated, and then I found out that he was killed in action on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But he made an impact on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He made an enormous impact on me because he, people say to me, I have been asked, do you hate the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I don't like to hate anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I hate the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I hate the people who have perpetrated that disaster on people. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">But you cannot simply say everybody is rotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">They're not. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">People are people. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">There are rotten people everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">But this incident, having just spent forty-five months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , to have a, somebody in a German uniform with a gun supposedly guarding me say to me I'm going to risk my life for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I'm going to let you escape ____ (ph) will kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And I may be killed with it but I love you, was an inkling that maybe there 1s after all another world of which I knew nothing about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Quite a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">What happened to you next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  We were evacuated in the middle of the night, just as Lucien had predicted, and we were quite sure that we were going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And we were not put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">No idea where we were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">That was May the 2nd. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Mind you I'm really coming to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Everything, or at this point here, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was combined of a tiny little <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where the Americans and the English and the Russians and the French on all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">They kept going with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Of course, they the guards were much more relaxed. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">They knew that this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">There was just no way, but they kept walking us, for week...for what seemed like endless...a lot of people couldn't make it and want by the wayside. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">In fact that's when I asked one of the older guards, I said by the way, you know that young fellow, Lucien, who was at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , whatever happened to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And he looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He said, ah Buby (ph), we got word that he was killed in uh at the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> two weeks ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Well I thought, I'm the one, he didn't feel anything, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">We went on and on and on finally we couldn't really walk anymore and this was already like May the 4th and I say May the 4th, because May the Sth I was liberated, so I knew that it had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We hi...there was a terrible bombardment. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I mean we heard and we _____ to see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , hear the Americans...what I don't know whether they were American but they were certainly Al...uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Allied planes</span> and tremendous uh fires from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and stuff, and we hid during one of those terrible raids in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and never went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Nobody looked for us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">The next day, we slept in a, that night we slept in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> we found with the cows and the pigs on the bottom, and the next morning very early - the sun was still shining - I liked through a crack and I saw a Russian soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I jumped out, woke everybody - there were about twelve of us out of the girls who were with me or I was with - and he must have thought I came from another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Well, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And I spoke fluent Russian, so I recognized, and I'm very sorry to tell you that eventually when we went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we wanted to be repatriated so that we could find out, because we were completely isolated - this is now <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> - the Russian commandant, who whoever he was, who was repatriated, and I mean people had no idea yet what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">People did not digest the horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Maybe the Russians did because of uh because they liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but the generally speaking the May the 5th was not yet a day that people knew what was going on, even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> which was liberated by the by the by the Americans, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and all that, the general public so to speak didn't yet know including some of the Russians, and uh he says you mean to tell me that there are some Jews still left through all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">But he said it in a way and I thought here I was in all the Pioneer as a child you know, being taught about the greatness of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> - I believed that garbage - and here is somebody throwing that anti-Semitic remark to me right back in my face when I haven't even gotten out from the stained, blood-stained clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">That was quite an awakening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">That was an I was jolted into another kind of reality from which I never quite recovered meaning that, and this is why I have contributed some of my time - what had happened then can happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And unless you and I, people like you and many like you and the Holocaust Memorial Committee and the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> , do not keep an absolutely alert vigilant eye, we may all be in trouble again, and it may not necessarily be the Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">It can be anybody who has green eyes and dark hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Anything can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I hope I have answered some of the questions you wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Tell me how you got, very briefly, from there to here. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Uh what happened after liberation? </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  Very briefly, I will try to do it, but as briefly as I can, because I want I was in the I was first in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">repatriation camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Uh since Martha told me to meet her in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> which is <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , not <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , and I spoke fluent Slovakian and fluent uh fluent Hungarian which everyone apparently does there, and I knew that I had absolutely no one left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> and I mean there was nothing to go back to - I had been completely alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">That was a reality that hit me very quickly 1n the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Now what? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Uh, I told them that I was born in _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> , and that I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">The only trouble I had to convince them is that I really was sixteen, because I looked like ten, and they were going to put me with the orphans uh program and I didn't want to be with the children's program. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I wanted to go on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And so I convinced them and told them I was two years older than I really was, which they didn't really believe me, but somehow I managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Uh and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">That's another story, not for today - that's quite an incredible story all by itself...
