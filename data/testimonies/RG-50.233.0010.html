ANSWER:  Right and he got packages from time to time with preserves or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I don’t know stuff like that, that was the big deal and he would sometimes give to the more needy children, you know give them a sandwich or whatever cause some of them, the ones that were poor were really poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Like my father in his youth had two shoes, one for weekday and one for the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That was a big deal because the poor children had just one pair of shoes for the Sabbath and during the weekday they would just go barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">You know we’re talking poverty here. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Q; Yeah, how long was your father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkatch</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  He was there until he was about seventeen or eighteen although I think there may have been some other Yeshiva in there as well, some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> but I think he was away for a total of four or five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Now the time that he was going there this <span class="REGION">territory</span> passed from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Did he tell any stories about the Hungarians taking over? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Now he was, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">A Hungarian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">4
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  This <span class="REGION">territory</span> was separated from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at the end of World War I and then taken back right around the time that your father went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Now you’re not aware of any connection between his going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkatch</span> (he would have been over thirteen years of age) that would be late 1938, early 1939 which is when the Hungarians march in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  And he’s there for how many years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Four or five.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Four or five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So he’s separated from the rest of the family for quite a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Well, he would visit obviously and stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Yeah, but I mean he’s living apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Yeah, although he did tell me that the people in the <span class="REGION">area</span> spoke many languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My father didn’t speak Czech, did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But many of the, like for example, the typical Jew would speak Yiddish, Hungarian, because that was the dominant culture so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And then either Ukrainian or Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And of course he would read Hebrew because that was the prayer language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  So your father’s family, going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now, when they were growing up, were they speaking both Yiddish and Hungarian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Yes but they would speak Hungarian in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">That was their first language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Hungarian speaking but they all knew Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  They all knew Yiddish fluently, like a mother tongue. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And they read Hebrew and they studied in Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Your father did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Yes, and so did all the other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  But he especially in the Yeshiva training. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Any other languages/
ANSWER:  Well later on he studied German. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">What happened was, I’m not sure what year but I think he was around seventeen and eighteen he came back and they thought he should learn a trade because they thought that trouble was coming and they knew that the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> is going to be taken away or something, not by the 5 Germans because there weren’t Germans yet, but just the rise of anti-Semitism and the Kolneilash.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  The Arrow Cross
ANSWER:  The Arrow Cross, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  The Hungarian fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Hungarian Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  So he learned to be a tailor and he also learned German because that was the lingua franca of the <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  So he started to study German and tailoring.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Right, sort of like <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Did he actually go to a formal school?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  This is a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he went to in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> 
QUESTION:  You don’t know which...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  I don’t know where.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  This would have been when he was about eighteen you say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I know that he was very excelled in German, in language and the Hungarian German teacher never gave him (one was the best grade, sort of like the A. Grades from one to five, one being the highest, five being the lowest)...and he would never get a one, he would only got a two. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And one time he asked her how come I don’t get a one I did the best paper in the class? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She said to Jews I don’t give ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Now originally did anyone plan on him becoming a Rabbi considering all the studying that he was...
ANSWER:  He was sort of being groomed for some sort of professional role or maybe taking over the hardware store, I’m not sure but it was clear that he was going to be the studier of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But I don’t think a Rabbi as such was considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Now Adolph, did he lose the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Well, yes, sure the Nazis took 1t away when they took power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  The Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">6
ANSWER:  Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There were a series of laws passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">First there were quotas imposed on what Jews can and can’t do in terms of university admissions or ownership of property and then there were sort of numerous closes which means they couldn’t attend <span class="BUILDING">university</span> at all; they couldn’t have any property other than personal property. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So they were taken away and there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> created in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span> and then...
QUESTION:  But not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Najhalaas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  I don’t know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Najhalaas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  It would be too small probably but there’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in 1944 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  I don’t know if it’s 1944 but it’s some time in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Your father has returned by then? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">A; Oh, yeah, yeah, he was already back because when the trouble started he moved back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  So he leaves <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkatch</span> , he studies at a <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and then he leaves that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Well I think that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or near <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already, the <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Okay, so the family is together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  The family is together, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Including your uncle Julah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">My grandfather was very big on the family being together in the time of crisis and you'll see that later on also. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Q; What was your uncle Julah doing there in these years before we go ahead?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  You don’t know whether he was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or planning on a trade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  No, Okay, so back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">7
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that my father lived in because my father lived in the <span class="REGION">Jewish community area</span> where all the other Jews lived so I don’t think they had to move but they did have other people moving in with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The people from not just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span> but the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span> was sort of the local capital there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nadjhalaas</span> perhaps?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Perhaps -- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were brought in and they were shoved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> including my father’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My father’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was relatively comfortable because again they were pretty well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And they were moved in there and it was pretty uncomfortable because there were many people per <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">There were several families living in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And then I think the last year 1944 is when the deportation started so all the Jews began to be rounded up and they were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They weren’t told where they’re going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  By Hungarians or by Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  I think it was mostly Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The Germans didn’t have the manpower to do all this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">What they had to do was: first they had to take all their personal belongings and mail it to this address that was given to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were told that thats’s where they’re going to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It’s a Hungarian address. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So they had to package everything and mailed everything to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  To a Hungarian address to an assumed <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">This was their assumed destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Assumed destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">My father said that the address was a phony address. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They never really read the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It was just put on a thing and it was all taken and used by the Nazis or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Did he know that at the time?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  So they actually mailed -- the entire family, your father, his father, everyone sent...
ANSWER:  Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or whatever had to be sent to this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They also buried, illegally of course, buried some stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">One of the things that were buried was my father’s sort of tools of the trade, his sewing kit, his threads, because threads were ---apparently threads were very hard to come by because the economy, everything was geared toward the war so civilians couldn’t come by thread -- you know spools of thread I’m talking about --° so my father took like a box of thread, different colors, needles and what have you and buried it under the chicken coop. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">8

<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  So they were burying things because they didn’t want to give them up, so they couldn’t carry them and they were hoping to return some day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Right, right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And of course I guess they believed the story that they were being fed but they all had doubts also. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They certainly didn’t trust the Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And so right, like you said they had hopes of coming back one day and digging up stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  Did your family ever tell you what his father and mother and other family members were thinking or saying during these days? </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Anybody doing anything that stands out in your mind besides burying things? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Did anyone try to hide, anyone try to get away”
ANSWER:  Actually I think that there was some sort of paper that my father acquired. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I think it was my father who acquired it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Somebody in the family acquired it, some sort of forged paper that said that he was Hungarian, not Jewish which would have allowed him to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and move away. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But my grandfather wanted the family to stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He felt the best chance of getting through this was just to stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So they gave the paper to I think a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Actually it was a passport, a Hungarian passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They gave it to my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Actually this cousin is still alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I'll get back to him after the war.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">9
QUESTION:  The person who survived, did he survive because of the passport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  I guess partly. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He wasn’t deported so to that extent he was spared a whole -- he sort of increased his chances of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We know it’s just a question of increasing your chances. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You couldn’t be really certain that you would survive one way or the other.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> was certainly nothing that was known to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  Did anyone hear anything about massacres that had taken place before either in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by word of mouth, did anyone hear of Hungarian soldiers in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> returning?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  But nobody knew.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  I’m not sure about this particular journey but late on in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> in general it was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">One particular time, I’m skipping ahead a few months, but they were being shipped from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> after they were IN.......0.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">11
ANSWER:  All the prisoners had a little sort of like a cup, like a metal cup and this cup was used for everything from getting the soup rations to getting any water if you could find some and also in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> on this particular journey they were on for several days at a time there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So what the prisoners would do is they would -- the ones that weren’t standing near the side -- they would sort of use this cup and then just get rid of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  Use it as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">portable toilet</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  He never did tell you what it is like being in that -- tell you what people were saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Here he is with his mother, his father, couple of brothers not knowing where they’re going to end up -- any stories about what they were thinking, what they were saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  No, not that I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The anticipation -- I don’t have any information about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  And with nothing to drink, nothing to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Nothing to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So they finally got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , sort of like the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp that</span> everyone sort of checked in through. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And they got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and they saw these Polish Jews who were inmates or prisoners, I don’t know what to call them with the uniforms, with the stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">These guys would sort of have a few whispers as they walked by because they weren’t allowed to talk to each other but the Polish prisoners who were there for years because the Poles had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> before -- would tell them about -- they would say things like, make believe you’re healthy because that way you would be steered toward, what was it, the right as opposed to the left or whatever it was, whatever their options were. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The other reason that if they made believe that they’re sick then they wouldn’t have to work hard or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They would go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">That was counter-intuitive to make the....
QUESTION:  That’s right, you don’t assume that because you’re sick you’re going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Any other suggestions they were getting? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Make believe you’re healthy and of 12 course how healthy can you be after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride like the one you just described. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Any others? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">How about age? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Did they talk about age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  They didn’t have a lot of time to talk obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  What about children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  There’s nothing to do about children I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But the Hungarian Jews, they communicated in Yiddish, thought that the ??? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">was arranged, that these people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because there are some mental problems because after years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they were so dehumanized and the remarks were so outlandish that they thought there was something wrong here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  There was. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That’s an interesting observation. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Here they’re getting tips, what we would call tips, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Helpful hints -- and yet as they hear this it’s so difficult to believe that they actually suspect that the messengers are deranged, crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And yet what else did they see when they got there? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Were these people deranged? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">What did your father see when he got out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  He saw the sign that “Work Makes You Free” and he saw there was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that you went into to strip and get rid of all the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They gave you the prison clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  He didn’t see any dead people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  No, this is up front. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It looks like a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Well it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">How about -- I mean those who’ve been there recall the smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Was there anything about the smell?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  I think the smell started later because at this point they weren’t burning the bodies yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">That only started when they were running out of time, the Germans thought they were running out of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">This point they still had time to bury the bodies after the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Or at least there weren’t as many <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> or they weren’t going at full speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  So your father, is he separated from the rest of the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  He was separated from all but the three. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">That is, my father’s father, my father and his brother -- next to the youngest brother -- stayed together the whole time until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Pll get to that later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  So Adolph, Yeno are separated...
ANSWER:  ...are together, separated from the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">13
QUESTION:  Yeah, are separated, -- the rest meaning the mother and the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  I think the rest of the children were there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And of course they found out a few days later that they were all killed because the children and the mother went straight to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  They didn’t know that until....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  Until much later when they got a feel for the rhythm of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  Okay so together they get stripped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  They get stripped, they get showered. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Believe it or not they get showered, they get their haircuts and they have to give up their shoes and they get their uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They’re tattooed I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Actually I have a very interesting story about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">My father’s number was A3166 and his brother’s must have been A3066 were very close by but what I am saying is my birthday is April 30, 1966 so there’s something very eerie about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I know it’s just coincidence to you but to me there’s something -- well anyway...
QUESTION:  They’re still together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  They’re still together and so they go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They were given these -- the first meal that they got was the soup that was very thick, liquidy -- very thick greenish -- it was thick greenish soup that nobody knew what it was made of or what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">My father’s father, my grandfather and my father’s brother didn’t want to eat it because it tasted horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It didn’t taste like food at all, it tasted like cooked tree leaves or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But my father said to them that we better eat them now because if we get this today we get the same thing tomorrow, it’s not going to be better. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">If we don’t survive we have to eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">That was the theme throughout. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">My father was into survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">My father said take what we get and you can’t be picky because you’re not going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And so I guess they ate it or they forced themselves to eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Every day they got a bowl of soup, this thick greenish soup and not much else. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Once in a while in the beginning -- things got progressively worse as it went on -- in the beginning they also got bread in the beginning, sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  When did they arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , did he ever tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  I guess it was sometime in ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was the fall of °44, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  Or spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  The spring, that could have been it. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He was there for a year, all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">14
QUESTION:  Altogether a year because the war ends in the spring of ’45 so the spring of ’44 one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  How long was he in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  I don’t know -- a couple of months, maybe several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I don’t know exactly how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I can’t name the camps that he was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I know he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; I know he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I don’t have all the camps off-hand or how long he was in each. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Jussi, my father’s youngest brother was very good at getting things. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">My father described that one time they would -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with the bread would come by and they would load the bread into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and the way it would work is that the guy on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> would throw the bread -- like big 3 kilo loaves of bread -- to the guy by the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He would catch it and he would just....And so my father’s brother Jussi was very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He snuck up underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- again this was all the beginning when there was still so much food -- he snuck up underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and between like sort of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the other guy stood and as the guy picked up the bread to throw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The guy threw it; immediately turned back to pick up the next piece and the other guy was still sort of still bending up from the previous throw and so he jumped up and caught it and he went back underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and he ran like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> because if you get caught for that that’s shot on sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Or hanged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Or hanged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  So he could steal bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  He could steal bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">This is very risky. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It’s the sort of thing you risk it...
QUESTION:  I know and it’s very hard to hide a 3 kilo loaf of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  What they do was they went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and they ate two thirds of it right away and they saved one third of it for my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">The idea was to hide the evidence and eating quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">There are two reasons why you have to eat it quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Number one you have to hide the evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Number two things always get either stolen or lost or if you work hard it gets damaged or stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Prisoners would steal whatever they can get their hands on. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So my father’s father said always whatever you get in rations eat it right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Don’t try to save it or ration whatever for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  It sounds like your father and your uncle found it difficult to trust other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">15
ANSWER:  Yeah, there’s another little story that bears on that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It’s a very dehumanizing experience and you got to the point where you care about your own personal survival and nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Not someone else’s survival?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Not someone else’s survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The three of them were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">That was an exception but other than that...
QUESTION:  So it’s the three musketeers.....
ANSWER:  Against the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Against the world and other prisoners are part of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Were there other people from your father’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  Occasionally they would have people from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but as the time went by people would either drop dead or they would be dispersed so there were less and less people that he knew personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Occasionally he would bump into people he thought he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">One time he was walking by near the perimeter of the camp and there were these <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And the guard yelled down at him in Hungarian because a Hungarian Nazi and he looked up, you know pleasantly surprised and he threw down, the guard threw down a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So he figured wow, Hungarian, there’s some people love me up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He tore the piece of bread apart and the bread was full of little needles, little you know the kind of needles you have in your shirt when it’s new.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Pins.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Little pins. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So if he would have bit into it he could have damaged his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So much for the Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Another story was that my father, Jussi again stole beets. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And that was another hot commodity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  He’s developing a pattern here. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Stole beets. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Where did he find beets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  Near the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They would sneak into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Again these were all capital crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The three of them ate so many beets that for days their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> was red. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">That’s all they ate was beets. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Another story about my uncle Jussi -- this I think is later. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">One of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- they were building something. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I think it was a <span class="BUILDING">glass factory</span> that was being built. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">This was toward the end of the thing so ’'m skipping ahead a few months because the allies would bomb it. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They had the three shifts -- the Americans during the day and the Russians at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">16
QUESTION:  The British at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  The British at night, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was being built; they never finished because whatever they built is knocked down by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They kept bombing this thing
QUESTION:  This was you say near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dora</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dora</span> is one of the things, one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It may have been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dora</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dora</span> was one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> my father was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">and so there was a little wheelbarrow that the prisoner has to push up on this little wooden plank at an angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So they had to sort of run up to get enough momentum to get the wheelbarrow full of cement up on the plank and they would only fill the wheelbarrow half way up because you couldn’t get enough momentum to push it all the way up the steep little plank. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned, became one of them, especially picked out bully types, came by and he said how come you’re only filling the wheelbarrow half way because you get more productive if you fill it fully so one of the prisoners explained that we can’t because we can’t push it up the plank that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So he said let me try. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So he had the thing filled up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  The Kapo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  He personally had his own wheelbarrow filled up and he...
QUESTION:  You’re talking about the Kapo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  The Kapo, right and he tried to push it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He couldn’t because it was too heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And bear in mind that the Kapo was in better shape than the other prisoners because he got more rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And so he got steaming mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He was very upset because not only was he shown wrong but he was also...
QUESTION:  Shown weak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Shown weak, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And so Jussi loaded the thing completely, the wheelbarrow completely and he went up -- just then he went up and he succeeded in going up the plank.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Jussi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  The same one that the Kapo couldn’t push? </span><span class="sentence" id="456">17
ANSWER:  The same one that the Kapo couldn’t push. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So the Kapo was very pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He gave him extra rations that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So these were little tricks that kept them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">There was one particularly long journey that they had to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They had to keep moving east because the British were coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  This was east from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Remember we started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  We skipped a couple.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> we go west. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Now do you have any knowledge of your father’s leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because that’s the first step? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We’ve got to get him out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> before we get him to the other camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">One of them was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">In the beginning they still had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Later on they begin to march on foot because again the German war effort required the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  And they were falling apart?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  Falling apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So I guess I’m sure the first time or two they still had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and they were stuck on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They didn’t have any...
QUESTION:  The three of them together still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  I believe so, I believe so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  How is your Grandpa holding up? </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I mean he’s got to be a good deal older to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He was hanging in there at this point still. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And the way they would get water they would stick those little cups I told you about and they would take-- I guess they had a string around the waist to keep their pants up -- and they tied that around the cup, one end of the cup, one string around the cup and they would hang it out the little holes in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> so they’d scoop some of the snow that was adjacent to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> as it went by so that was the refreshment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  So they were being moved around in the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">What happened to my grandfather was that they were being relocated at one point and they had to march on foot. (</span><span class="sentence" id="485">End of Side One) 18
QUESTION:  So we were talking about your family is being marched from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to another and you were going to tell me something about your grandfather who is too weak or feeling weak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  His legs were giving out and he felt he couldn’t take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So the two boys, my father and Jussi gathered around him. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They didn’t want to leave without him so my grandfather told them to go and they still wouldn’t go because they didn’t want to abandon him so he commanded them, you know like invoked biblical thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother and he commanded them to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And so they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">My father later learned that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> the Germans of course were going to kill everybody, destroy the camp because they had to destroy evidence but this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> apparently was liberated by the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  The camp that they were leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Right and my grandfather was liberated by the Russians it seemed, later my father learned because the Germans didn’t have time to shoot the prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  But you don’t know the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  And you don’t know when this happened, this separation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  No, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  Time of the year? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Nothing in your father’s stories that reveal the season.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  No, not that I can think of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  But it wasn’t <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  I don’t think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  And it certainly wouldn’t be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Okay, so your grandfather was liberated by the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  Right, right and my father later learned that he was taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> but he never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The Russians treated the Jews as prisoners -- there were freezing conditions in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and he apparently died in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I don’t have any detailed knowledge on what happened to him because my father only heard through sort of people who came back from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and it was sketchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">19
QUESTION:  So your father and your uncle are marching...
ANSWER:  But had they stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they would have been liberated by the Russians and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian camp</span> would probably be better than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> so it would have been a better deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  Why was your father able to stay? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I mean there’s stories too of the Germans shooting people who couldn’t march.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  Right, I guess they didn’t have -- my grandfather -- I guess didn’t have time to shoot him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  But your father and your uncle were forced literally at gunpoint?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  To march?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Yeah, I mean at one point it sounds like your grandfather commands them to march but at any point are they being forced marched by Germans/
ANSWER:  I don’t think....
QUESTION:  Would they have been free to stay if they had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  I see what you’re saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">If they had pretended that they were sick and couldn’t march then they -- the Germans weren’t going to go around sending around doctors checking everybody so I guess if they were pretending they were sick they could have stayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  But did they realize that your grandfather would in fact survive that way? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I mean very often the Germans would kill people who were too sick to move
ANSWER:  Right and I guess they sort of expected that because their attitude of not wanting to abandon him shows that, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  That’s why I’m asking these questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Right, I think they figured that he’d be killed but nothing was certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Nothing was logical.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Nothing was logical, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  So how about this march that your father and your uncle.....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Now here’s the big march what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">First everyone was give relatively big loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Again my father’s philosophy was not to save it but just to eat it 20 right away for fear of getting lost or stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And they’ll be marched and it was a long march without food.....you had to march I think like eight or four in a row and if you fell behind then you’ll be shot because there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> behind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And see if you slow down --- but they didn’t give you time to sleep so what happened was they would sleep, sort of sleep as they marched and so like lean on each other or something as they continued to walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  How long did this go on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  I think it was a three day trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  Three days without sleeping? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">No rest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Without sleeping, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">At one point they came across a <span class="DLF">marsh</span> near the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and they were so thirsty that the people started running for the water and the Germans started shooting because they didn’t tolerate the lack of discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">My father didn’t run because he knew that despite like his natural urge, almost irresistible urge for water and for rest he kept going. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And this is something else that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">This sort of thing ? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">repeated later. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">At one point they were given a chance for a hot shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">There was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> full of hot showers and the people would be there for a few minutes but then they had to come out, after about two minutes or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And some people were so -- you know enjoyed the shower so much that they just wouldn’t come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The Germans would come in there with like with sticks and start beating them and they still -- you know people would just collapse under the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> rather than walk out because they were so deprived of any sort of physical comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  And this felt good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Right and this felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">My father tells me that he wished that once more in his life he can get a full meal of baked potatoes and then he can die, you know like his last wish but to feel satisfied with a stomach full of baked potatoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  So where did they go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  They went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  You don’t know the name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  I don’t know the name, some landmarks along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">One time one of the prisoners took with him a pair of phylacterites (tfillin). </span><span class="sentence" id="551">He put it in his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He snuck into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And so the people who were religious which I guess were most of them, I don’t know, a lot of them stayed up all night putting on the phylacterites, just putting it on quickly and taking it off, just for a second because they weren’t given an opportunity to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">21
QUESTION:  Where had they come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  One of the prisoners snuck it in his shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  All of this time they had -- or was this a new prisoner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  This was a new prisoner who snuck it in and it disappeared or something after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It wasn’t like an ongoing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Also later on toward the end he used to stay out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were too crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">If you stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and caught you’d be shot but it was still worth once in a while because I think there were about four people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So what he did was he’d hide under the dead bodies so he could have a -- stay out you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Yet you don’t know which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> this was? </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> from my guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  And he was never caught sleeping <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  No, I guess he wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">After time went on toward the end all they had -- their sole task -- they didn’t have to work any more ??? </span><span class="sentence" id="568">enter the factors -- their sole task was to pull the dead bodies and pull them into this big <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So they would have this little stick with a little thing, hook, at the end and they would put the stick like underneath the dead bodies -- I mean they weren’t necessarily dead, you didn’t know, you thought they were dead but you didn’t have time to check their pulse or anything -- you put it underneath their chin and you pull that stick with the thing at the end and you pull the bodies that way into this big <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">You [indistinct] hide the evidence because the Germans were running out of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  So prisoners like your father were doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Right, for months he did this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Your father and your uncle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">My uncle was getting very weak by this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  A few more things. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">When they were liberated...
QUESTION:  This was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  You know the British liberated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">22
QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Do you know the time of the year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  The time of the year, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Spring, °45, April.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So they came around with loudspeakers and it was announced in several languages that here we are to come to liberate you. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">My father was semi- conscious at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He was laying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and he didn’t really understand what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He really didn’t understand what liberation meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So they -- the British came around with these sort of paramedics who would check who was still alive and they thought my father was dead because he was in horrible shape, emaciate and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And my father sort of unconscious let out a sigh. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He wasn’t conscious of what was going on but I guess deep <span class="NPIP">inside</span> he had to let other people know that he was still alive because they were about to pull him away with the other dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So that’s how he was saved and he was put in the same --they were put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">There were two people per bed at this point because the British didn’t have enough rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And all the British had was these cans of lard that they had -- given to the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Imagine swallowing lard without any other food or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So you had to like just swallow it because again my father would just eat anything to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">My father informed the people that he had a brother, Jussi and that they should bring him to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So the next night they were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">They were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> They slept head to foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And Jussi couldn’t swallow the lard because he was too malnourished or he just couldn’t do it physically but he just couldn’t swallow the lard. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Had he been able to swallow the lard or had there been proper medical attention at this point he still could have been saved because -- Jussi still could have been saved because the --you --- he wasn’t like -- he was still conscious and he was still relatively speaking okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And so like the next night my father woke up, the next morning and Jussi didn’t move and that’s when my father -- I think he had a major, a major I won’t call 1t a nervous breakdown but he had a major sort of you know a major depression for several days or several weeks because this was the last member of the family, the last connection with reality that was still there for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  When ---I’m still trying to follow the chronology described. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">How many days after liberation did he die? </span><span class="sentence" id="606">You have them liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">The British come in and then...
ANSWER:  Within two or three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  The second day your father asked the British if he could bunk with your uncle and then another day and your uncle dies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">ANSWER:  Right, right so it would have to be the first three or four days or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">23
