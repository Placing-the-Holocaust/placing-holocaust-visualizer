<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you know why, perhaps, it --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, I can -- can’t remember why, exactly what the reason was why -- but -- why they were allowed to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">But basically Jews had lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , or in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> since sometime -- something like 1246. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The exact history of the Jewish community has been reworked now, and is fully available in the -- in a group that has been formed in -- since 1988 in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has been reworked now, and is fully available in the -- in a group that has been formed in -- since 1988 in that town, who -- a small group of people who have occupied themselves with the history of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And they have fabulous documents about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">So if you have to clear up something, this 1s where you can go, and anybody who wants to research the subject should go to these -- to these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  How large a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was there when you were living there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  There were -- about 25 Jewish families lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And there were Jewish families in every -- all the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a -- you know, was the county seat, and the -- all these other Jew -- little Jewish communities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , some of them had their own <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , but none of them had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> in the villages, some of them had their own synagogues, but none of them had schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And -- so everybody had to come to -- to p- all the Jewish children had to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borken</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We -- oh, I had one towa- want to mention one more thing which I -- this third thing is very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So the Jews in a -- 1-in effect, had lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for 750 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And though it was a free <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that means it was- it was -- it had -- it was an independent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which could make its own decisions, my father was the only Jew who was ever elected into the town council. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">There have been no Jews before that, and no Jews, of course, since that -- since itch -- there are no Jews living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Everybody emigrated, or perished in the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Well tell me, if you would, tell me your father’s name, and when was he part of this council, and maybe you could tell me a little bit more about him, and your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My father’s name was Maurice Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He was born in 1885, and he went to -- like a -- all the Jewish kids in na -- in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , he went into the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> for the first four years of his schooling, which we can suppo -- suppose we can calculate when that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And then, at the age of 10, he went into the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which actually was a larger, <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And he graduated from there at the age of, I think about 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He did -- he did not finish up as a full matriculation because there -- there was certain stages. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And from there on s -- from then he -- he went into the textile trade, and he was an apprentice in a wholesale textile ware -- company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , 1-1-in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He -- when World War One broke out, he was a -- drafted into the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and his unit was continuously short of food, and supplies, and he made it his business to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian towns</span> and get provisions there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And coming back from one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">expeditions</span> , a -- a -- he was shot at by his own people, who hadn’t recognized him, and as a result he lost a leg, and as a result of a big loss of blood, he lost a lung, and so he -- his whole like -- life from there on, he had only one leg, and one lung. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He was extremely brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He was lucky that he was sent to a Jewish home for recuperation in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> for recuperation in Switzerland because of having lost the lung. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Of course the -- you know what -- the --the -- the -- he was treated as if he had tuberculosis, which he did not have, and there he got involved in founding a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish recuperation home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I think it was called Itania, which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all those -- those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">When he eventually returned to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , he set up his own company, and my mother was his partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Now, ma -- tell you a little bit about my mother, because she had a totally different background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Actually, and -- first tell me when he was elected to the town council, cause you said that was such an unusual occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Yeah, he was -- I think he was elected to the town council only in -- either in 1930 -- 1930 or °31. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Then, of course when -- when the -- when the -- there were so many elections just before the Hitler period, and he of -- he was the chairman of the social democ -- democratic party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">When the social democratic party was reduced to only one representative in the town council, I -- my father decided that his non-Jewish social democratic -- what trying to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  A colleague of his, or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  A colleague -- colleague should stay, rather than he. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And so that he was out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Now, how did he get into this position that people voted for him? </span><span class="sentence" id="39">When he returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , after World War One, and set up his own business, he also took a very active part in the league of war orphans, widows. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And -- I’m trying to find a -- find a English wor -- when people who had been injured in the war, there was a -- a -- a league like that, and he beca -- soon became the head of that league. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He had his staff work on all the applications which were necessary so that these war orphans, war widows, and people who had -- war injured could apply to the various <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span> for the support to which they were entitled. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And he never charged anybody for all these services, and therefore he became very, very popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">His staff was -- his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> staff, which was concerned, of course with wholesale textiles, was a-accustomed to service the members of the league of war orphans, widows, and people who had been injured in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Oh, I also started to tell about my mother’s family, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My mother’s family lived in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falksen</span> , which was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And my grandfather, Maurice Frankel, had come from somewhere in the Brunswick area, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> <span class="REGION">Brunswick area</span> , Braunschweig at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He had set up his own business, and this is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , he was a total free thinker, didn’t believe in organized religion at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But -- and his wife, my grandmother had the same attitude, but it doesn’t mean that they were hiding the fact that they were Jews, they were not at all hiding, but they just didn’t believe in organized religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Their ideal were opera, and <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , German [indecipherable] you know, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In fact, one of the sisters of my grandfather was an actress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , and she was a paramour of the king of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">She was very good looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Even I remember her, though vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And of course, I’ve seen pictures of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, it was totally different type of upbringing, but nevertheless my mother also had to go to Hebrew school two or three times a week, in -- this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springer</span> <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> two or three times a week, in -- this was a town called Springer, which was a -- probably only about four or five miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">There -- you know, in those days of course there were plenty of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They went to and fro by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So she too had a smattering of Jewish education. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And then when she finished elementary school, her parents sent her to a finishing school, to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , a Jewish finishing school where essentially ladies learned to be good housewife, and as a result my mother was an outstanding cook, very much oriented towards the French cuisine, which she had learned in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , her parents sent her to a <span class="BUILDING">finishing school</span> , to Belgium, a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish finishing school</span> where essentially ladies learned to be good housewife, and as a result my mother was an outstanding cook, very much oriented towards the French cuisine, which she had learned in -- in Belgium. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">For a short while, she actually worked, after the [indecipherable] she -- she was a -- a companion lady or whatever you call this, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Rosensweig, was a German philosopher, Jewish philosopher who -- who -- usually his name is connected with Buber, who was in -- who was -- who was later on a professor in -- 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , at the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Of course, Franz Rosensweig was at that time already very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He had contact -- contract-tacted syphilis while he was in the German army in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And sa -- but he was an outstanding thinker, and ve- very famous in his interpretation of general philosophy and Judaism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  And what’s your -- what was your mother’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Else Frankel. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">E -- E-l-s-e Frankel. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Now --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And when was she born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  She was, I think, five years younger than my father, so she must have been what, 18 - 19, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Sol tell me a little bit about the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then, that they had for you, as you were growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Try to give me a picture of what the -- what that, you know, how your daily life was like at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and of course, could you mention, you know, the siblings who -- who are your siblings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I only vaguely remember the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which we lived during the -- during the first three years of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is not in existence any more now, but I know exactly where it was, it was near the railway station in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borken</span> <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> in Borken. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And my parents just rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> th-there. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Now, my father was very successful in business, he was a -- always a financial genius. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And -- and I think in the year 19 -- yeah, ’35, just before my younger brother was born, he bought a very stately <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , just outside the town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borken</span> , which had been built by a man who was the owner of a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> once, th-therefore they had -- they hadn’t -- not spared any -- any expenses, any bricks, or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is still in existence now, and it’s still an outstanding <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , up to the -- up to the sis -- da -- this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And it still has a lot of the features which it had when we lived in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">At the time when my parents bought it, and it was not developed around it, gradually they, you know, they planted <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and bushes, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So we had two maids as servants, we had people looking after the <span class="DLF">vegetable gardens</span> , and after the <span class="DLF">flower gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And above all, my father had a chauffeur, since he couldn’t drive himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He was always on the <span class="DLF">road</span> for -- during the whole week. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Usually he came back at night, sometimes he did not come back at night, but he usually came back at night and then went out again in the morning, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rural district</span> , to sell the specialty textiles to people who make custom clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So it -- it -- it -- 1 -- it wa-was certainly upper class. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I think we had a higher standard of living than anything I have achieved since then, or my brothers have achieved since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My older brother was called Karl, and he -- he was two years older than I. He’s still alive now, he lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Now he’s called Gashom Kadar. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He’s changed his name during wor -- World War Two, when he was serving 1n a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And my younger brother, his name was Tayol, and when he went -- went -- went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1950 -- let me see, he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">He too changed his name from Gans to Kadar. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I have to excuse myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Okay, if you could just continue to tell me about your life in your <span class="BUILDING">childhood home</span> , and was it a very festive life with your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Tell me a little bit about the sort of routines that you had, you know, as a family, and at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well the routine obviously was we go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Until the age of 10, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> , where we learned both the secular subjects and the basic parts of the Jewish service, including the translation of the five books of Moses and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So w-we had a systematic education in learning classical Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Then, at the age of 10, since our parents were well enough to do to -- they could send us to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , we shifted over to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Now, th -- the routine at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was that we’d all be in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until about one o’clock and then came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and had the -- the main meal of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">In the afternoon we were supposed to do our homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Had some sort of other activities, we were essentially free. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it’s -- is a -- <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was essentially Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Not -- we wouldn’t call this strictly Orthodox, call it like the modern Orthodox in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> now here. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And Friday evenings we would go to the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">After the service there would be a very festive meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My -- my father would be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Saturday morning we would go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> would finish at about half past 10, 11 o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We then would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and have a very festive breakfast, and after that we were obligated to go and visit our grandmother, my father’s mother, who was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And at that time she was beginning to be about 75 - 80 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And we had to visit her every Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And after that we’d go back to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for the afternoon service, a -- which was at about one o’clock, and about two o’clock was the main meal, and in the evening at the end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we would again go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and participated what’s called the Havdalah service. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, it was a -- a life that revol-revolved largely around the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">On Sunday we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , which was strictly devoted to Hebrew and Jewish history. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">one room school</span> with eight grades in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Of course, we who -- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> only stayed in it for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But there were people -- Jewish kids in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who -- whose parents could not afford to send them to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and who did all the eight grades in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">one room school</span> , this was a <span class="BUILDING">one room school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Which was very interesting because it -- it almost was like self education. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There was only one teacher, and h-he would attend to all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But when he taught history, or when he taught something to somebody else, of course you could always listen in. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And I think [indecipherable] that was very, very good for our development. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That’s in my -- in my days, the name of that first teacher we had, his name was Gunsberg, and he became an outstanding person in the [indecipherable] s-service, or [indecipherable] organization in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , when he finally em- emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , some time before World War Two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  When you started the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , tell me what age you were when you started the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and were your friends at the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> only Jewish, or did you have also non-Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  We started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> at the age of te -- 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Before the Hitler period, we mixed fairly freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Not hundred percent te -- hundred percent freely, but fairly freely with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And there was not much of a distinction made between Jews and -- and non-Jews, and you could communicate very easily with everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">In my case, of course, this only lasted for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And then in 1933, when I was 11 years old, Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But in the case of my older brother, this state of affairs had much -- lasted much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My cousin -- my oldest cousin, who was of -- the oldest amongst all of us who was at that time, he must have been already about 16 or 17, he had gone through that whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and of course had been totally integrated into the class in which he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So th-tha -- there wa -- there was not much -- there was not much distinction made, but there -- there -- there was -- always was a certain amount of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And the really wealthy families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , non-Jewish wealthy families did not mix with Jews, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So there were certain --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you remember feeling anti-Semitism in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> before -- before Hitler came to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">First of all, it was already 1932, the Nazi movement was already very active, and certain -- let’s say parents of certain -- of children have -- were already very active Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And they already came out with some objections to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It didn’t -- it wasn’t very serious, and we didn’t take it very serious, and we also had -- always had already answers to everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We always fought back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  What would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Well, some of the [indecipherable] I remember somebody say to him -- said to me, you Goddamn Jew, you have a bend in your nose, you know, Jewish nose? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I said better -- I said it’s much better than having a bird in your brain like you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I said -- that’s the German expression for -- for being a nut, 1s to have, you know -- so -- but it -- 1t more or less stopped there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Did you ever feel, you know, physically harassed, or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well now, are you talking about f -- before Hitler, or after Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  First before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Before Hitler, I don’t -- I don’t think -- I personally had no encounters of physical harassment. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Maybe it was just lucky, but I -- I don’t think it was very common to have physical harassment before Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Would you say -- can you tell me how large the overall <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was, how many people lived there, and was it -- would you say it was pretty good relations in general between the Jewish community and non-Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had 8,000 in habitants, and as I said before, there were about 25 Jewish families in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The relationships were, I think, pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">There were, of course, very Jewish businesses, and there were certain people who were anti-Semitic, who were just avoided. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You just didn’t con-contact them. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Of course, the -- the point of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with 8,000 inhabitants is that everybody knows everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">You couldn’t hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But by and large, I think it was a pretty peaceful life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Now before we get to the time when Hitler comes to power, can you give me just a very brief snapshot, the personalities of your family members; your mom, your -- your father, and your siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Just give me a sense of, you know, who they -- who they are, and -- and their personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Well, my father was the -- was very, very respected by -- by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He was our greatest friend, and w-we three sons had a extremely good relationship with him when he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">This is tape number one, side B. If you could continue to tell me -- you were starting to tell me about your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  My mother, of course, had a hard job educating three sons, and no daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And she was -- could be quite volatile at times, and put on quite some scenes when we wouldn’t go along with what she preached. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And w-we could at times form a united front against her, and she would complain like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> to my father, who w-would get very upset about it, when he heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But -- and I don’t want to underestimate the fact that, of course, my mother was in the afternoon in -- in my father’s business, and we were somewhat educated by the maids we had in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We had two maids, as I said before, and we had other se-servants, and that had some sort -- quite a bit of influence on us, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Which I suppose is the usual experience of people who have grown up in -- in we-wealthy homes where there were servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">My older brother was -- he was very much the intellectual. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He we -- he -- he was what you called a bookworm. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And he -- he loved reading, and it came -- came -- c-came in very handy later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I can go into the fine details afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And my younger brother, he was outstandingly good looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So -- and my mother always said that I’m -- I was her only s -- d-daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I had to learn all the practical skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I had to do all the stuff in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , helping and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">My -- my older brother was shielded from that -- he was quite awkward, too, that’s because he was so bookish. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">My younger brother, of course, was spoiled like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> because he was so good looking, and so I had to have all the practical skills to -- to help everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So those -- those were the personalities, and they somewhat remained that way all our lives, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  So tell me now about Hitler coming to power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Well, of course it wasn’t a -- it was not unexpected. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">There had been so many elections, and every election <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was going further and further to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">More and more people were voting for Hitler, or voting for the right wing parties, some of which were eventually merged into the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Another thing, another point I have to point out why all this was not so unexpected. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">When we visited my grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falksen</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , they lived in -- ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was largely Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very radically in with the Nazi before Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we went visiting there, there were a lot of kids who didn’t play with us because we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And they were already converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So it’s a -- a -- th-they -- this is where the indic -- these were the indications of things changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">This a -- well, I never forget the day Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We were having lunch, and we were listening to the radio, which was on because we listened to the one o’clock news. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And the newscast came out, and then suddenly the announcer said, “And here is a little message, which has just fallen on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , the president of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Hindenburg, has appointed Adolf Hitler as the chancellor of -- as the next chancellor of the German state.” </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I remember my mother was very, very shocked to hear this, and somehow we took it and said -- said well, that wa -- this was just one of the things we had to face. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The full implication of it, well I suppose we didn’t ful -- fully realize -- at the time the kids didn’t, but my mother obviously did. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">My father was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I can’t remember whether he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But soon -- he certainly came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very soon after. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Now -- things changed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> now very -- I would say very rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">There -- some of the cra - oO -- some of our classmates were keen to join the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There was no Hitler youth in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and every time they had a demonstration, they had to call out the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which included us, for all their -- their demonstration, and whatever they were celebrating at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Eventually my father got us out of there, we didn’t have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what -- what do they call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It’s called in German [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Had the torchlight parades and all that sort of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We didn’t have to go -- go along with that any more, but in the beginning we did, because the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> just said everybody come tonight, there’Il be a torchlight parade to celebrate this, that, and the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And so we had to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Now did you always feel and know that you were against this, even though you had to be there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no identity cris -- crisis. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That, I think is the advantage of having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">My father’s father had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to marry my -- marry my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And he had grown up with the Sephardic Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , though he was not Sephardic himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">In fact they were from the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> that borders on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And every time the word <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> was used, he spit. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I didn’t know him personally any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He -- he died in 1917. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He had a hernia [indecipherable] there was misop -- mis-operation, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that sort of things was part of the Jewish tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And there were two Jewish families living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , who had come from either <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and who had been exposed to this whole business of pogroms, and -- and ma -- Jewish persecution in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So again, everybody was Orthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one’s history. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We had absolutely no identity crisis when all this came. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">People find that hard to believe, particularly I -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lot of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not brought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when someone was in the army, and people [indecipherable] working professionally, and who had -- who -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to power, and when they were excluded from the social life which they had practiced up to that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But as I said -- of course, the other point was we couldn’t socialize that well with other pe - with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn’t eat in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and eat with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">As one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the ha -- we first went back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , this -- we -- <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were not that comfortable in those days, and we all were friends because we played on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So the -- the intimacy that one now can experience in being in each other’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we had -- we did not have that in any case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  So did you start to experience more restrictions at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And also who -- tell me a little bit about the composition of -- of the student body at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I think you s-said in your memoirs mostly Catholic, but tell me a little bit about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">The -- of course the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was largely Catholic, and most of our classmates before Hitler belon -- belonged to a Catholic youth movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That was the standard thing to do, for everybody to belong to the Catholic youth movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">That of course we -- we were already automatically excluded. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We did not, at that time, have a Jewish youth movement to which we belonged, but we did later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Now, all these -- of course, now the pressure became very strong on all these members of the Catholic youth movement to change over to the Hitler youth, and most of them did, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It took a little while for everybody to go along that <span class="DLF">line</span> , but this is - this is where they went, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And our attitude to them was you are wrong and we are right. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Well, it’s a -- things came to a head on the first of April, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Now, this was only what, three months after Hitler came to power? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He come to power on the 13" of January, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The -- they started this boycott movement against <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And it was a Saturday, and there were storm troopers in front of every <span class="BUILDING">Jewish business</span> to make sure that people wouldn’t buy at -- in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And w-we of course had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday, we didn’t write, we didn’t ca-carry our satchel because we were Orthodox, but we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and listen to the school classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And while we were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the -- one of the teachers -- of the most trusted teachers, [indecipherable] was trusted most, came and called us out, and he said -- he said to us, I remember there were four Jewish boys in my grade, “Look, you know what’s happening to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I think it’d be safer for you to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So, when we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and well, you know, this- this was the dramatic, the most dramatic change you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Course our parents were -- I won’t say shocked, but they were stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And my father wasn’t going to take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So he immediately [indecipherable] the Shabbat was out, he got on the telephone to the headmaster of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and he says, “Hey, what’s happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I’m not going to send my children back to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> if you can’t guarantee their safety.” </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I am convinced that that headmaster then had to contact all the necessary party lines. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I don’t think there was a Gestapo in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> yet, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I was very much aware of the Gestapo when it finally came, because of course, they -- they- later on, at the outbreak of World War Two, they took over our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But I’m sure he -- he couldn’t give my father a direct answer, he had to square this away with all the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Anyhow, by Monday morning he told my father that all the Jewish students could come back to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and they could guarantee their -- our safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  How did you feel personally? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Were you getting worried, as -- as a youngster?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Not in the least. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Not in the least for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They were wrong, we were right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Do you want to take a short break?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Yeah, I have to get my medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Okay, if you want to continue telling me recollections of -- of this early period when the Nazis came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  So that was April first, and the next lightning bolt struck on May first. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Of course May first is always celebrated in -- in Europe by all labor unions and people who have anything to do with labor, you know, which the Nazis thought they were -- were too. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">This was a big celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And of course there again, we had to have a -- a parade, and again, since there was no Hitler youth, so we -- we ha-had to collec -- come together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">There wasn’t a big demonstration, but we suddenly -- one of the teachers came out with a swastika emblem, which showed that he’d been - been a member of the Nazi party for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I don’t know whether it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">There’s a long history attached to this character. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He was a dis -- teacher of mathematics, bio -- and particularly of biology, and he eventually was charged with teaching the signs of a racist, a subject -- new subject, which the -- the Nazis had thought out. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Anyhow, on May first it turned out, he -- he came out with a swastika emblem on his coat, which showed that he had been a long time member of the Nazi party.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  And you -- you witnessed this yourself, this was --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I have a long history with this man, who of course now, by now he’s dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But he was an invalid. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I can’t remember from what any more, but he -- he -- he walked av -- one of his legs wasn’t functioning properly, so he was never called into the war, he stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> through the whole war period, and as I said, I had quite a history with this character. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Anyhow, now m-my older brother, who decided that we should not communicate with our classmates any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We -- we shouldn’t wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He was -- my older brother was the sort of leader of the Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">My cousin, who as I said, who was about at that time was 16 - 17 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">When he died last year he -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He was -- he -- he wasn’t in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more, anyhow, so my older brother became the leader of the Jewish children, and he decided that we’re not going to wait until we’re excluded, we’re going to separate ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So from that time on was -- we did not communicate with our schoolmates any more in -- in the -- in the a -- in the periods between lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Well -- we -- communication was absolutely at a -- at a minimum. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">You know, without any degree of intimacy between them and us. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So, and this how I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">My older brother, who left in 1935, who -- which was three years later, and went to, at that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And so he was out, and so other Jewish children were taken out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and sent abroad, or didn’t continue <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Emigrated and gone [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So eventually, by the time -- by the time I left, there -- there were only very few Jews -- Jewish children left in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  Did you feel -- what about the Nuremberg laws? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Did you and your family feel repercussions also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Yeah, the Nuremberg laws as far as we were concerned meant that we couldn’t have any non- Jewish maids any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We then managed to get some maids whose nationality -- we-were Dutch by nationality, you know, it’s in a -- in a fr-frontier area like that wasn’t that difficult to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But that was the na -- the major effect it had -- had on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I am not aware of any other of these, you know, manifestation of the Nuremberg laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  What about your father’s business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  My father reduced his business considerably, and he started -- he -- he concentrated all his efforts on getting cash out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he set up a new business which sold vacuum cleaners, and irons, and you know, for -- for pressing clothing, things of that nature, because he saw a chance to do business of that nature, to get a lot of his money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacuum cleaners</span> , and irons, and you know, for -- for pressing clothing, things of that nature, because he saw a chance to do business of that nature, to get a lot of his money out of Germany, which of course, was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">There were schemes of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I know my uncles had had schemes of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My father’s brothers who were -- all of them were doing very well financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And - and including my father’s best friend, who became my father-in-law later on, he too had a scheme of this nature, and this is how people who had money managed to get some of their possessions out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , some of their cash out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It’s -- it’s a complicated way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Might be interesting to investigate it some time, but I think it goes too far to talk about it in great detail here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Do you -- do you know at least where, in general, he was sending the money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Yeah, to -- largely to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And he -- he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> very frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">He had a cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Winterswijk</span> who cooperated with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And I don’t know all the details about it -- it -- but there -- there always was some money available for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in the early stage, when he -- he went on a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I think in -- first time in 1936, or 1937, and you know my -- of course my older brother was there, and he obviously had to pay for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my brother went to Ben Shemen together with all the -- a lot of the famous leaders of -- o-of -- a lot of the men who became the famous leaders later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ben Shemen</span> together with all the -- a lot of the famous leaders of -- o-of -- a lot of the men who became the famous leaders later on in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Tell me --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Including -- in -- and amongst these -- his classmates were people like Rabin and Dayan. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So he -- so, as I said, money was available from -- for him to attend these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Tell me what were -- what were the conversations like within your family, and at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">What were you talking about now? </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Your father’s business was changing, the changes at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">What - what kind of conversations at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Was a -- what were we -- what were we talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Well, I don’t think the subjects changed that dr-drastically. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">My parents were still very much interested in literature, talking about s-sub -- subjects of culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And they -- they did occasionally discuss what we should and should not do, and what we should and should not say in public. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And -- and if you had to be cautious and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">At a very early stage of 1933, of course they came and -- the police and the storm troopers came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they went through my father’s <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , but they weren’t -- weren’t enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious background. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So my mother, too, had no -- absolutely no fear of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So I call them a bunch of drunkards who -- who belong to a club of dr-dr-drunkards, meaning the storm troopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And I’m sure they -- my parents are not afraid of them and nothing close to -- very radically happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But my father was in the -- interesting point, my father was in the town council. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">He had advocated that the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for girls, which only had 50 students in it, should be combined with the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> of boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Now, of course, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic town</span> that was out of the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">My father had always based this on the huge expense the 50 student school was for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to support, and they said there should -- there should be a combination of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Well would you believe that within two months after the Nazis came to power, they combined the two <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="329">My father was away, I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> at the time, and my mother -- I remember my mother telling him on the telephone that this has happened, but of course she didn’t say it direct because the telephones were probably listened to. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But she said -- she used some Jewish expression to -- to make him aware of that this was -- was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Finally his scheme was being translated into reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So from one day to the other we had girls in the class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  Now, was your -- was your life a-aside from not interacting with non-Jewish students at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , were there other things about your daily life that really changed, or was it largely the same as -- as before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  It was largely the same as before, except that [indecipherable] we cou -- we couldn’t show our faces any more at sports events, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">You know, these sort of sports events that are organized, what shall we say, by kids themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">There was a certain amount of exclusion there, and that it got worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But there were -- there were classes to teach aircraft design in the afternoon, which I participated in and I’m sure we were allowed to participate in. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So it’s -- 1-1t didn’t change too drastically, except now, the other thing was of course that now we had a different teacher, who was very, very keen to -- to st -- to teach much about -- we had a different teacher -- teacher of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> , and he was very, very keen that we should go into much -- to greater depths in -- in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And eventually we went to Hebrew classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Now, I’m talking about modern Hebrew speaking classes, every -- every day, except Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Every afternoon we had Hebrew classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So that -- that was a radical change. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And of course it did us a lot of good, and -- because go -- got us much into greater depths into Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">This teacher, who also later on was -- became the headmaster of the Mizrachi high school in Tel Aviv, he started the -- also the [indecipherable] movement to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a little bit of a organization which was -- through which we met other Jewish kids from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> <span class="BUILDING">Mizrachi high school</span> in Tel Aviv, he started the -- also the [indecipherable] movement to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a little bit of a organization which was -- through which we met other Jewish kids from other towns occasionally, and so we were -- became the members of the Mizrachi. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Now it’s a national religious party, but it wasn’t as radical as that in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">The youth movement, and we were part of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  So this was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borken</span> , and was this a Zionist group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, it was a Zionist -- Zionist group. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">That must have started round about 1934 or so, because my older brother was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when we started it, and he became one of the motivators of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And as I said before, he left in 35, I think, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So that -- that was another connection which we had -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">This is tape number two, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My mother’s sister had gone to the Jewish agricultural school near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , as -- when she had finished <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish agricultural school</span> near Hannover, as -- when she had finished elementary school. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And there she met the man whom she eventually married, Alex Mo. And who was one of the teachers in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And both my uncle, Alex Mo, and my aunt, spend all their lives until they emigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , being in charge of <span class="BUILDING">agricultural training schools</span> for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Now, in 1932, I think it was, I spent a summer in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which they ran at the time, which was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gutwinkle</span> , and we somewhat participated a little bit in the work they did, and ma -- we were rewarded for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But then, in 1933, they took over a very large, what we called a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hashavah camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cultural training camp</span> for Jews who were changing professionally to agriculture. [</span><span class="sentence" id="357">indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And I spent almost every summer there, until I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And this of course, 1t was a fantastic influence on all our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We -- we loved the ti -- to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Since my uncle was in charge, we had, of course, a lot of privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">One of them was that we did a lot of horseback riding, and s-systematically learned horseback riding from one -- one of the teachers who was there, non-Jewish, who had been in the German army cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">My uncle himself, who rode around all the time, supervised the work that was being done in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> by these trainees, who were changing from all sorts of profession over into agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And to a child this was an absolutely 1 -- ideal way of -- of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We -- I have interest stories of the -- of the life we led there, and it was a -- a [indecipherable] connected with the work and play, and it was a terrific experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And I had -- it’s of -- very much set the atmosphere, both for my brothers and for myself, as to wh-where we wanted to go professionally, eve-eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Some --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How did it -- how did it establish your direction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  Well, my uncle thought well, of -- you know, he -- he put -- put us into whatever we wanted to do, and was -- wherever we could be used. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We -- in the morning we always worked, and he soon found out that I was very, very handy, so he assigned me to the <span class="BUILDING">repair shop</span> which they had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And that sort of set me on my -- on my aim to become an engineer for repairing -- for agricultural machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I played around already at that time a little bit with the idea of becoming a chemical engineer, but it was -- there was -- everybody said you can’t do that without doing it full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And I always felt that I would never have the money to go to a full time <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So, there -- that was, of course, my idea, and I’ve already mentioned, my older brother went to an eke -- went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , went to Ben Shemen, which was the agricultural school in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ben Shemen</span> , which was the <span class="BUILDING">agricultural school</span> in -- in Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So that set his life, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And my younger brother, he -- when he finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , eventually he also took up -- there was a -- a job in -- in agriculture, and stayed in that <span class="DLF">field</span> all his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He later on became a specialist of fertilizers and things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So all our directions were set by this agricultural experience, which we had in the <span class="BUILDING">training schools</span> run by our uncle and a-aunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  And this is when you’re a teenager, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  And what about your Bar Mitzvah during this time of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Well, Bar Mitzvah to us was not a big deal really, because we knew so much Hebrew, and learned so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And my older brother was Bar Mitzvahed in 1933, yeah ’33, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And at the time -- at the time my -- my mother’s father had just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So my parents didn’t -- for that reason, and also because the Hitler business, did not want to make a huge Bar Mitzvah for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But, you know, he had a f -- it was a very nice Bar Mitzvah and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Very luxurious, but it was kept relatively small. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">You know, we had a huge family because my -- my grandmother had five boys and five girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And we al -- and they all married, and they all had kids, you know, so th -- wa -- it was somewh -- somewhat resented by all these relatives that they- they weren’t -- the invitations were relatively kept to a small [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Now, by the time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1930 -- it’s 22 and 13 is 35, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Yes, that’s right. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="391">33 to thir -- yeah, ’35. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">By the time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1935, w -- we had a really huge Bar Mitzvah, with all the trimmings on it, and of course people coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they had to be fed three times on as -- Saturday, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="393">On Friday nights, on Saturday morning, and s -- then somehow again something -- something again in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We were expected to do the whole Torah reading for that day, of sh -- was no -- no difficulty to me at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And we were expected to do the whole reading from the prophets, the Haftorah readings for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Again, no -- no -- no particular -- wa -- and we were expected to make a speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And I made a f -- apparently made a speech which upset my parents very much, because I -- politically it was unwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, I think I started off by saying we are being accused of -- of such and such, and such and such things now, and I’Il teach you that this is totally against our laws, and that we couldn’t be like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And so it’s a so -- so anyhow --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So your -- your speech actually had to do with the political climate and the times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But you know, the speech was made at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , not in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And the servants of course that were around, were non-Jews, who served the meals, so -- I don’t think that my parents had e -- invited any non-Jews -- non-Jewish friends to any of these occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  What were your favorite Jewish holidays growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  Oh, I would say Pesach, Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Best food. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">You know, cause of my mother, being such a fabulous cook, all these things were -- were -- were on a -- on a Scale that wer -- was gour -- real gourmet eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I mean, even the -- you know, that we -- we of course did not eat meat on the nine days before Tisha B’ Av. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">But it was wonderful, the stuff my mother cooked was just out of this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">No meat in it, and this being summer, you know, you have all the fruits you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And she made the most fantastic fruit soups, and vegetable soups tha -- vegetable dishes, anything you could think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And this way it was no hardship at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">The only hardship was that we also couldn’t go swimming in those -- in those nine days. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And in the summer, you know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So we were waiting for Tisha B’ Av to be gon -- be gone so we could go back to the s -- to the <span class="INT_SPACE">swim baths</span> , you know, go swimming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  That reminds me of something you wrote in your memoirs about the <span class="DLF">pool</span> in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Can you tell me about that during this time period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Yeah, actually it’s a -- the -- the -- the <span class="DLF">pool</span> was not forbidden to us, except for certain times. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They had to, you know, there was sort of a mixture between Catholic and Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">They had periods [indecipherable] was women only, and -- where women were allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Those periods we did not- we were not allowed to go into the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> , the town <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> <span class="DLF">town swimming pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But then they also had periods when the -- the <span class="DLF">pool</span> was open to men only, and those periods -- in those periods we could still sneak in and take a swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So we had to be carefully attuned to what could and what could not be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  Was there any rule at all that said that Jews could not swim in that <span class="DLF">pool</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  Yeah, not -- not -- not -- not complete exclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The exclusion was only for the periods when women were allowed, or mixed swimming was allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So we managed to ge -- to gets -- to sneak in still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  Were there any other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where you weren’t actually allowed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  They -- the -- the -- you know, there was only one movie house in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> in town, and that put up a sign fairly soon saying we don’t want any Jews, Juden [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And when that sign went up, my parents would not allow us to go in any more because this is -- you know, that -- that was that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  So it’s not like you tried, you just decided not to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  We decided that -- not to go, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I think if you could have sneaked in, nobody would have objected very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  And what about any recollections of Nazis in -- in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , did you ever have any encounters yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Violent, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I mean, it started to get dangerous to -- to walk in the -- 1 -- you know, in the very beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> around that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You know, on Saturday afternoon we would go for a walk, and sha -- would want to play, and there were certain guys who -- who it was dangerous to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And they were beating us up and God knows what. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">That’s -- we had to be very, very careful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Did this actually happen to you, or mostly to others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Yeah, yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Once a guy hit me in the face with a burning rubber -- rubber what do you call it, a rubber stick, and I, you know, I had an injury from it for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And there was another, you know, usually it was just beating up, or stones being thrown, and things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">You just had -- had to be very, very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And you just -- nothing you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You had to recognize that there was superior force on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">You don’t stand and fight superior force. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">You just have to flee from it, go into an <span class="REGION">area</span> where gro -- you have enough grown-ups who would interfere with what these kids were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  So now tell me about what -- what happened -- what leads up to you going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Actually, my parents wanted to get me into a Jewish high school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> in Berlin in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">On -- on one of the many trips to this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , that training farm which my uncle and aunt -- aunt were in charge of, I had to -- come to know two of these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> <span class="DLF">training farm</span> which my uncle and aunt -- aunt were in charge of, I had to -- come to know two of these schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They had to -- they had come to visit the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I got very, very friendly with some of the teachers, and some of the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And as a matter of fact I went to one of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and well, for a day or two in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and listened in, and from -- and then my parents said in 1938, that I should leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and go to one of those <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And it was decided that since all these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> are very far advanced in teaching English, I will need enough English to ca -- catch up with the other me-members of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  What languages did you know already at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  We had been -- we had, apart from Hebrew, of course, which we did not learn in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , our education was Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">We -- we -- ever since we were 10 years old, every day we learned -- had at least one or two hours of Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Latin was the foundation of our -- of our knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Now, I learned some English, I learned some French, but certainly not -- not to a very high degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Anyhow, my parents wanted to send me to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for the summer, and -- to learn English, and then I -- I would come back to -- to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , my parents wrote saying that they have talked with other people, and they’ ve come to the conclusion that it’s not wise for me to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And they said what would you do if we were tell you, you just stay where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And what did you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  Wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I had -- I had made friends, again thr -- through my relatives with other f-family where the gentleman was very active in the Jewish agency, Adler Rudell. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And I went to them, and I told them that -- what my parents had written, and -- and what should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And we decided that the thing to do was, since my means were limited, was to go to an intensive tutorial college, and try and do metric, you know, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> cer -- equivalent to a high school certificate, in that fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And I -- I loved the idea to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  Now tell me when is this, how old are you, and what kind of major experience 1s this for you at this time, because you’re pretty young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">This was 1938, so I was 16 years old, and -- I liked the idea of trying to make it in about four or five months, to try and get -- get a equivalent of a high school certificate, and then go and start working. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Since I knew exactly what I wanted to do, I would get myself a job, and I would go on and learning in -- in evening classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I didn’t have any doubts as to what to do, and I like -- as I said, I like the idea to be on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now my parents did come over occasionally, my father or my mother, or both of them, during all this time when I first came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and -- until the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They -- on and off there, they were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  Was it easy for you to leave, and also for them to travel like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  It was very easy for me to leave, because we all had been living so close to the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> , we all had passes to cross the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It took a long while to get a passport wh-which could take me past the frontier areas of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But we -- we -- we all passports at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">One more thing, already at that age, I had learned to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">My father wanted me to do that in case we suddenly had to get out in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So by the age of 16, and of course t-totally illegal, I knew how to drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I -- I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on a Friday afternoon, Friday morning, I crossed the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> , went to my c -- my father took me to his cousin, I stayed there for the weekend, and on Sunday I traveled on to Hoek van Holland, took the night boat over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and arrangements had been made by my parents for me to live temporarily with a family, a very nice family in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night boat</span> over to England, and arrangements had been made by my parents for me to live temporarily with a family, a very nice family in -- in London.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  So when you were preparing to leave, were you thinking a lot about the escalating events in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Is this what you and your parents talked about a lot? </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Is this also -- was this on your mind a great deal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, in my mi -- we came to the con -- conclusion that things were really getting worse and worse, and that it wasn’t worthwhile to take the risk of sticking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So -- and since I was out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> anyhow, my parents felt that I should stay out, because as I said before, my older brother had been in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> since 1935, so it wa -- it wasn’t such a big sh -- idea for me to get out, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  But your parents and your younger brother did stay in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">My father somehow just couldn’t make -- give himself the push to cut off everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He saw more and more chances to get at least some of his money out, and he was going to stick it out to the -- to the end and get the maximum amount, you know, of course that probably was the wrong decision to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">My younger brother also stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">My parents were rather reluctant to let him go because he was not independent yet, and so he stayed until after Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  So tell me about what you knew while you were now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , what you knew about events, things going on like Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">What -- what did you hear, and what did you know about what was happening back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Well, it’s a -- you know, this became wu -- practically headline news in the British papers, when this Kristallnacht happened, and some of the papers tried to say that this was spontaneous, you know, and other papers, like the new scr -- new [indecipherable] liberal paper, they said no, this is organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I discussed -- discussed it with my friends, the Adler Rudell, and he said, “No, this was organized by the state, there was nothing spontaneous about that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="502">This was an assertion of power, a first sign, and if you had no doubts about it, where all this was going to -- to -- to lead. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The fact that so many people had been put into <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , some in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and so on, so forth, I mean I don’t think that anybody, at least I didn’t have any doubts this was the beginning of an absolute disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Were you worried about your family, your parents, and your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think I was worried about my parents because I knew that they could always get out when they wanted to get out, and this is what they intended to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And -- and that they had enough means to -- to -- to get out when they wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So from -- personally we didn’t -- I didn’t feel this was a -- was to -- go -- going to be so critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But you know, the [indecipherable] the stateless Jews [indecipherable] family in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , people who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and never -- never become citizens, and you know, they were picked up, and shipped away, and put at the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and -- and -- and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">That time we were very much aware of what was happening to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">You should -- you know, the Poles didn’t want to let them in, and the Germans wouldn’t have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And, you know, these were families whom we knew. [</span><span class="sentence" id="512">indecipherable] 35 families in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , of course you know everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  Did you have a feeling once you’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> that you may never return to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , or what was your sense at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Already when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I knew I would never -- never return. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And I was -- I- I was convinced that this German experiment would last for ages and ages and we would never be allowed to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I never mentioned that this was all going to be over and done with in -- in what was it? ?</span><span class="sentence" id="518">38? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Fa -- ’45? </span><span class="sentence" id="520">That’s seven years, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It’s incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It’s incredible, except that it didn’t seem so incredible after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> we knew that war was coming, and -- and that Hitler would go too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So -- but befo -- but when I left, I thought I will never see the <span class="NPIP">place</span> again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  How did that make you feel, had -- did you feel an attachment to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Yes, I -- I did, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I -- after all, we had traveled a lot in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we had been in various children’s camps, things of that nature, and I -- I -- I loved the beautiful landscapes, the beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children’s camps</span> , things of that nature, and I -- I -- I loved the beautiful landscapes, the beautiful woods and all. [</span><span class="sentence" id="529">indecipherable] very much trave -- traveled along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> <span class="RIVER">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Was a beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> , by -- into -- by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and so we were very much aware of what the <span class="NPIP">place</span> looked like, and definitely had -- definitely had a certain attachment to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Felt very bad about never being able to see it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  So tell me a little bit about your life in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and are you following the news very carefully? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Is this something that you really were, you know, closely following, about these developments? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Just tell me about this phase of your life before the war actually starts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Well, first off, as I said, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I was living with a wonderful family, with the Jacobs, who were the [indecipherable] Mr. Jacobs, he’d been an officer in a Jewish brigade in World War One, and of course, knowing a lot about Zionist history, all this makes a little sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">His wife was from a Jewish family that had settled originally in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , she spoke quite a good ger -- German, and sh-she was [indecipherable] woman, very hard working. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They had one daughter, about my age, and also living with them was a nephew who was an orphan, and who went to business every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And also a distant relative, a girl from -- a Polish Jewish girl apparently from very well-to-do parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">She spent every afternoon in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">She was a total movie addict, this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So -- so it was a big <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and actually we only ate together on- again, on Friday nights, and Saturday lunch time. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was located right be -- within one or two blocks of the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which was a big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and that’s where Mr. Jacobs belonged. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And -- and I concentrated on learning English, very much helped by Mrs. Jacobs, who had no hesitation to correct me, telling me what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And ever since I love reading newspapers, and the Jacobs, since they were liberals, you know, with a [indecipherable], course the newspaper was a news chronicle, and I u-used to translate newspaper articles and then learn them by heart, and this is how I si -- taught myself English, to a large extent, very much helped, as I said, by Mrs. Jacobs, as I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Was a wonderful time I had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Was a little bit expensive, and so I couldn’t stay there any length of time, but while it lasted it was -- was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">This is tape number two, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, one incident that actually I think is worthwhile recording is one day Mr. Jacobs went to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , and he said, “Do you want anything from the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And I said “Yes, get me “Mein Kampf,” Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” in German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Of course, while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I would never do them the honor of reading this, but I felt I had to read it, and I’m very, very grateful that I did read it at the time when I -- whe -- because it made it so clear, totally clear as to what was going to happen, from reading that book. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And this -- all this -- the propaganda methods, the way to achieve their aim. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">This business of expanding <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into the eastern [indecipherable] and sh -- chasing all Slavic nations behind the euro -- and all this was all -- the all -- all set out there, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It -- 1-1t was shus -- it was oka -- I don’t know why I did it, but I did read “Mein Kampf’ in German while I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Then occasionally we went to the movies, Mr. Jacobs took me to the movies, which was, of course, in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And that -- that was a good experience too. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And generally ha-have a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Eventually, when my parents say cha -- that I should stay, I realized I couldn’t stay with the Jacobs because it was far too expensive, and I had to go and look for cheaper accommodation. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">An -- but -- but of course, by that time my English had improved a lot, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I had made up my mind to go to the tutorial college in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Euston</span> -- it -- 1s it <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Euston</span> <span class="RIVER">Euston</span> <span class="BUILDING">tutorial college</span> in Euston -- it -- 1s it Euston? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It is near -- I know it’s near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bushhaus</span> in -- it’s -- it’s <span class="RIVER">Euston</span> , which is spelled E-u-s-t-o- n. And so I made the arrangements to find a new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or new digs with se -- with those factors in mind of having to go to -- to the tutorial college every day, a-and obviously I still wanted to be near a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="BUILDING">tutorial college</span> every day, a-and obviously I still wanted to be near a synagogue and all that, and I had to live kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So that’s -- determined where I settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  What were the signs of -- of the war now -- now encroaching, coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Well, the signs were the demands which <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> made on <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">There was the gathering of the party -- I can’t remember any more where it was, where they -- where they celebrated the presence of the S-Sudeten German people, and their demands for incorporating the Sudeten area into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="REGION">Sudeten area</span> into Germany became very, very loud and forceful, and it was quite obvious what they wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They wanted to annex the <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And this led to the Munich gathering, which -- in which <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> agreed -- <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> agreed that Hitler could go into -- could annex the <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span> without <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> going to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Well, of course, Hitler signs a piece of paper saying that this would be his last demand, and it will be peace in our time. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">That’s the famous peace in our time. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And Chamberlain came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , he says peace in our time, the memo in his hand, and I remember next Saturday, next Shabbat in <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> -- I still went to the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , Mr. Jacob saying, “I don’t like this whole thing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And of course, there was the famous speech by Churchill in <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> , where he told Chamberlain y- you had to -- you had to choose between dishonor and war, you chose dishonor, that’s why you’re going to have war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Was this -- was this a difficult time for you to --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, it’s a -- you know, it no -- it became -- it -- it just said it was all inevitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">This 1s all - what’s going to happen and so there was nothing we could do about it, and we just had to fit ourselves into this -- into this -- into this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Before the Munich agreement, a lot of people had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , including my landlady and her daughters, [indecipherable] and I was sort of asked to look after myself, which I didn’t mind at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And they -- they returned after the Munich agreement had been signed, and it was pretty sure that a war would not break out immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">People we -- were divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They ca -- people who were conservatives, conservative Jews, I mean, you know, this conservative party of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">There were a lot of those in a rich community like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goldaskreen</span> , and they took the attitude Chamberlain did the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">We have not got the means to go to war at the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He s -- fo-fought for time. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The people who were liberal like Mr. Jacobs said it was a dishonor which we shouldn’t have gone in for. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And the people who were lesstich labor, they -- they had been such you Jews, they had been such pacifists, that they -- they -- they wouldn’t hear about -- about any requirements such as having a draft and mobilizing, and any of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">They -- they couldn’t get used to this idea [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And, as I said, I was very much influenced by the views of people like Mr. Jacobs, who were liberals, who -- who thought this was a --a dishonor. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So we’ve faced reality, as best as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And -- and of course the pressure on -- on the German Jews which -- other Jews became larger, until more and more refugees coming into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and a lot of -- and the difficulty of getting jobs for people, and getting a way of finding money to live on became larger and larger, but the British Jewish community was a [indecipherable] and an extremely well organized, largely by volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They had money available, and they -- I think they, in my opinion they took care of this refugee program in an excellent -- in a wonderful way, in spite of the fact of course, obviously everybody finished up living at a standard of living which was far, far below the sort of standard of living they had experienced in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Was life difficult for you as a refugee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , or did they also make it easier for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  Well, you know, the point was that I had enough money to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">All I had to look after was t -- to do, was to work and work and work and try and get this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> simetric in four months, which I didn’t succeed to do eventually, but nevertheless, that effort [indecipherable] was the only thing I -- I was going for. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">It’s -- I -- I did not have to share in a lot of the hardships which other people were exposed to, because after all, my father could send me some money -- carefully, you know, didn’t squander it in any way, lived very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">But it gave me certain pride to -- to live in a frugal way. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And as I said, my aim was to -- was concentrated on qualifying for the high school certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  So tell me about the start of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">After I finish the <span class="BUILDING">tutorial college</span> , and have not passed the examination, I -- I passed everything except the English, I just wasn’t good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But I -- I decided I was not going to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I registered as the [indecipherable] I -- I went into the German Jewish aid committee, and saw what went on there for a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And in the evening, one of the ladies, she was from the Shief fam -- family -- you know, these were all volunteers, people who did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">She had -- obviously has a tough day, and she says, “Would you like to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I said, yes, I’ll go. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I thought it was very important that we -- we refugees would not all congregate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and so -- so I -- together with a few other people, a few days later, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , and again, there was a organized German Jewish aid committee, first liv -- first lived in a -- in -- what do you call -- would you call it, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Some sort of <span class="BUILDING">communal house</span> , which again it was, you know, had to be kosher, and -- and it was very nicely organized, and all that, and of course we had to work and keep it clean and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And the c-committee went out and to tr-try to find us jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And -- and through them, eventually, I got a -- a job which- which I liked very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">In fact, this was the first non-Jewish offer which the committee had had for jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And I wanted to go into machinery repair, and it turns out that this, we -- this part of this -- this <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> was not -- the <span class="BUILDING">repair shop</span> was not unionized, so I could go -- go -- go into that, and fit myself into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And it turned out to be an extremely good experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It’s an interesting story, you can tell it in great details. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn’t work on Saturday, I wouldn’t work on Friday afternoons, or would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> early on Friday afternoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But they -- they didn’t mind at all, they said, “Look, if you don’t work, you don’t get paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">If you clock in and you clock out, and that’s it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Initially the German Jewish aid committee subsidized my -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where we were, that I should go to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to a certain address where I would be able to make arrangements to finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- permanent <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, a <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span> to -- to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I had hardly changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address, and to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautiful estate, very rich, obviously very rich people. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I didn’t know what it was all about, but I was hope [indecipherable] the right address. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">It turned out that my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be introduced to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">These were the Steinats. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous Laskeys were the richest family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And the Steinats were the second richest families. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And they were -- s-started my relationship with that -- that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The brother of Mrs. Steinats had also been an officer in the Jewish brigade in World War One, and that -- so the connection between Mrs. Jacobs and the Steinats. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So you see it’s just all -- all a question of connection with -- and it was very important in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , everything 1s c- connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">It’s not what you know, it’s whom you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And the Steinats made arrangements for me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr. Steinats father. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He didn’t like her at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But it came in handy for me to -- to live there, and I lived there with another German Jewish man, who was two years older than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living there as a lodger. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Now, this lady rented <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and she provided meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn’t [indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I had accepted, w-w-was technically very good, but it again, the circumstances of -- of cleanliness, and toilet facilities were just d-disgusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">But I th - | thought this 1s part of living like this, and I was living on the -- during the week I was living in the poverty of a working class atmosphere, and on weekends I was going to the Steinats for practically all my meals, and living in a very, very high class atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Undoubtedly the Steinats were richer even than my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So I -- I think I have to take another trip to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Sure. [</span><span class="sentence" id="634">tape break] So where were you when the war began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Well, just let me tell you about one more item that was also very significant in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It -- first of all, as you may remember or may know, I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler marched and took over the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Of course, everybody thought the war was going to break out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Because now the attitude of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> to try and get a er-great alliance with the Russians going. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And of course that was their big hope, that they eventually would pull that off, and pull it off together. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And -- and all the workers in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where I worked said we’ll be in war -- at war in a week or so, and I say, no you won’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They going to try this, and they’re going to be -- do their best effort to -- to pull a -- make alli -- a major alliance with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And this is very much what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So nothing much happened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But the -- these two elephants were not in -- on the way yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was at the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Quite young, he was in middle 30’s, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable] after the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats had invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together with a few other very prominent people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">The day was glorious, the weather was glorious, the food was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot, and this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the Institute of Advanced Jewish Studies at <span class="BUILDING">Brandeis University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And he -- we became friends right there and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful lot, until the time he died in, I don’t know, some times in the 80’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">He was professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , same time professor at <span class="BUILDING">Jerusalem University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And but that’s -- basically he was a fantastic thinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , and then later on here, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And he set me on a path of -- of studies, and views that have sur -- very much influenced my life and gave me a much deeper understanding of Judaism than I could have possibly gotten in any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So that was sometime on May, 1930 -- ?</span><span class="sentence" id="654">39. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly transpired that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had made a pact with the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union had made a pact with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that they were going to divide up <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> between the two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I don’t know whether we were a hundred percent aware of it, that they were going to divide up <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time, but you know, that’s what it amounted -- amounted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And now the <span class="DLF">road</span> was clear for Hitler to march into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and -- which he did on September first, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="658"><span class="COUNTRY">England</span> declared war on the following Sunday, this was -- September first was a Friday, and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> declared war on a -- on a Sunday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I happened to be at the Steinats at that time, listen -- listened to the speech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, which he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I had the -- the exact text of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I’ve asked people to look it up, I think I want to look it up, it’s very worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He said these [indecipherable] evil things we’ll be fighting against, bad faith, something something, and oppression, but I can’t remember exactly any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And against these, I’m sure the right will prevail. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Is it [inaudible]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So the -- the first thing -- the first thing we experienced at the time, was that we all had to register, we German Jews, and we were, in a typical British fashion, put before a <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> , which [indecipherable] each case individually, and people were classified into a categ -- German -- you know, we were off -- t-to the British we were all German. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">There were -- category A went straight into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">interment camp</span> , category B could go on living under certain circumstances, and category C were totally free, and being treated like British people. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Of course with my connections to the Steinats and all that, I had no difficulty in being assigned to c-category C. So 1-it didn’t affect me in the beginning, at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">The -- there now was a -- a c-call-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Conscription was enacted, people were called to the services, and obviously the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was getting on a war fut -- footing slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">This was the period which we call the phony war because nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">There was a British expeditionary force sent into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> but not into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And th- they were very -- an-and the <span class="REGION">western front</span> was extremely inactive, nothing happened there at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Hitler was occupied in the east, conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and this was a -- and apparently things were very quiet, but everybody realized this was a quiet before -- before the storm. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I continued to work in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> I was, and in January ni -- 1940, I managed to pass the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> certificate, which I had continued preparing -- prepared in pravin -- largely in private class, private pa -- private tuition, and not -- not even going to any classes at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I had a pr -- civil pri -- different private teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I -- I had a very heavy German bicycle, which -- with which I run around all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German bicycle</span> , which -- with which I run around all over the place, at all times of the days and nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And somehow this way I -- I managed to -- to -- to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">In -- now, you know, jobs became freely available. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">There was a shortage of workers everywhere, and after awhile I decided I wanted to go and do something closer to what I -- my long term aim was, and I got myself a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that manufactured agricultural machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They -- actual -- in actual fact, the actu -- the experience was -- I felt was not very good, and the agricultural machinery was very crude compared with what I had been doing up to that time, and I didn’t think I was learning too much from getting -- being exposed to this machinery, and I have -- wuf -- had more or less made up my mind to give all this up, and go into a different direction, for to -- to go into machine tools, which were th -- at the height of -- of what has -- one has to know as a mechanical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But then of course, came the invasion of - first of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and after that the invasion of the lowlands, and the attack on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> , and now everything changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Obviously with the -- the use of secret sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers that suddenly rose up in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , in -- in less -- to a lesser extent in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , but to a larger extent in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , now the British public became a -- very, very concerned about people like ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">The first affected -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> interview with Manfred Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">This is tape number three, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  So, after the invasion of the lowlands, and Hitler’s victory in the west, and after the British expeditionary force had been brought back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> in the famous Dunkirk retreat, it -- our life was made a lot harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">As I said, I had to given -- I had to give up my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Luckily it was summer, so I could do everything by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and the days were long. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But very soon thereafter, we were interned -- put into an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The first internment camp I was in was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> I was in was near Manchester. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It was an old disused <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , terribly filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bury</span> , B-u-r- y, and there were about -- there must have something like two or 3,000 people in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They ranged from German merchant sailors, so ver -- real Germans who had been taken prisoner on the high seas, to us, the ultra Orthodox Jew, or the Orthodox Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">There was a whole big group of Orthodox people there, and we all stuck together. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We of course didn’t participate in the -- the general food, we -- we did our own cooking, and looked after ourselves, which meant no meat, and of course there were no such things as eggs, so f-food was pretty short. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I don’t -- can’t remember how long we were in this disused <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We were lucky that the weather was perfect, for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and this was a beautiful summer, because I -- I -- thinking 1 -- in case of rain, I don’t think the <span class="DLF">roof</span> would -- would have held up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  How did you first learn that you were going to be sent to this <span class="BUILDING">internment place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Well, the police came around, you know, the police came around and said oh sorry, you ha -- you have to pack up and you have to go -- you’Il be interned. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The -- first they had come around before, and you know, told me to se-sell the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , which I did, I sold it to a neighbor who -- who was a bicycle nut. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">He l-loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , and then they came around later on again, and said sorry, we have to intern you. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So this was from one day to the other, pack up, and I --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And when was this, when did this begin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  This must have been something like June, July, 19 -- 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Sis -- so we were in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bury</span> , this -- this used <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , tried to make ourselves useful by working, it’s one thing or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">That was a lot of time to spend, but a lot of people had bor -- brought good books, and tis - there were interesting discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">As I said, I -- I think there must have been something like 2,000 people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="704">From there we were eventually shipped to a place near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shrewsbury</span> , which was an internment camp which was all <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , so we lived in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> which was all tents, so we lived in tents. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Again, the Orthodox ] -- Jews kept together and had a very organized life. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">There were enough rabbis amongst that group to organize all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And we kept to our -- ourselves, and everybody tr-tried to he -- help, and make -- make a go of it. [</span><span class="sentence" id="708">indecipherable] I -- I did feel -- I became quite weak because of the lack of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">The one main instance I remember is that when the son-in-law of the famous chief rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , Dr. Hertz, whose -- you know, who has written that book [indecipherable] Torah -- underneath the green you'll find the -- that’s the Hertz Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And he came around and he -- he sort of assured us that they would see to it that the -- the food situation would improve. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But, of course, it couldn’t be for a very long time in this tent camp, and I think some time in -- probably in September or so, maybe it was later, I can’t remember exactly any more, every -- these -- we were all shipped over to the Isle of Mann, where they had fenced off whole districts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> , and I think some time in -- probably in September or so, maybe it was later, I can’t remember exactly any more, every -- these -- we were all shipped over to the Isle of Mann, where they had fenced off whole districts of the town and some [indecipherable] were converted into -- into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Again, there were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with -- for Orthodox Jews, and we all kept to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But life was quite organized there. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It was -- 1t was before Rosh Hashanah, because I remember, you know, the -- the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seaside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">For Rosh Hashanah, a lot of people went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> for like a -- you know, doing the cleaning, for a mikvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is all 1940 still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  1940, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  Who -- was it only Germans there, and were there any women, or only men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  There -- there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s camp</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I don’t -- don’t know -- can’t remember where it was any more, but there were only men, you know, in case -- there were only men in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">The -- yeah, the -- as I said, the life was very -- start getting very organized, there were a lot of classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">You could learn anything you wanted, people taught just about any subject you could think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And of course there were a lot of aus -- Austrians there. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">There were very good lectures on psychology, and very intensive classes on -- on -- also Jewish subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Mathematics classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I remember I started learning mechanical drawing there, and there were people who were teaching automobile design and things of that nature [indecipherable] was very -- intellectually very, very active.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  These are just classes taught by the other people who were being kept there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">All self organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Well, I don’t know when it was, I think it was October, November, they had the -- there was an announcement that the age of entry into the army for enemy aliens, whi-which we were, had been lowered from 20 years to 18, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So, I had actually tried to volunteer for the army before that, but because I -- I still saw that eventually we wouldn’t be able to avoid it, but I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Then they lowered the age, and a few British Jewish officers came around, and organized meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Had a big meeting in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> and told us to come and volunteer for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Well, I -- I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">It was somewhat resented by some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">A lot of people said that they will join if they were free men, but they wouldn’t join from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> , things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But I thought that was neither one way or the other, and that they eventually will have to go one way or the other anyhow, so might as well g-go and do it sooner than later. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I d-definitely wanted to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was it a -- was it also a -- even though it was intellectually a -- a per -- you know, a period of fruitful intellectual activity, was it also just very harsh conditions, living conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="740">What were the living conditions like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Living conditions were pretty good, except again for this food business [indecipherable] the living conditions were quite good. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">We -- we lived in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Of course, every <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had -- was full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , you know, and there was one common <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining hall</span> where everybody collected for anything that’s -- what wasn’t sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And -- and it -- it -- 1t was not -- it was not a great hardship, no way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">QUESTION:  Did you feel that it was unfair to -- to keep you 1n an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Well, maybe I did, but I -- you know, I -- I -- I felt a sympathy, with all the things you’d read about the -- the Quisling regimes, and the traitors that had been in Fr-France -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I -- somehow I -- I -- I sympathized with the British, that they had to do this in order to make sure -- they couldn’t j-justify -- before their own people they couldn’t justify having us run around free in their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So it -- it was more -- it was definitely done more for morale and propaganda than for actually being afraid that things might -- sas -- there might be spies amongst ourselves, and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So I -- I was willing to accept this affect, that this w-was a necessary move that the government had to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And then in -- I think it was beginning of December 1940, it was my turn to -- to leave, and we -- I joined the Pioneer Corps, but actually what was happening was we were -- we were ju -- went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from the Isle of Mann, first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ilfracombe</span> , which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you know, it’s just -- just south -- in the far southwest of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Isle of Mann</span> , first to Liverpool, and then to Ilfracombe, which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you know, it’s just -- just south -- in the far southwest of England. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the Pioneer Corps, the -- Pioneer co -- the alien man -- Pioneer Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">The other members of the Pioneer Corps were British s- soldiers, who had -- actually were very -- had come 1 -- were not -- not completely trusted because of legal difficulties, or were people who had -- were not fit at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So we had these German Austrian companies of the Pioneer Corps, that were made up of very f - relatively very fit German Austrian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And -- and the Pioneer Corps stayed there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ilfracombe</span> in the southwest for a few weeks, for some sort of basic training, which of course did not involve weap -- weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">We were not trusted with weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And from there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yorkshire</span> , my company went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yorkshire</span> , and -- which there w-was a big army camp, Ketray camp, and from there we went to a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ketray camp</span> , and from there we went to a very nice place in the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lake district</span> , beautiful place where we build a -- a <span class="DLF">petroleum dump</span> for storing gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">You know, it was all labor work. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">In Ketray camp, I don’t think we did that much labor yet, but then we went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sedberg</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ketray camp</span> , I don’t think we did that much labor yet, but then we went to this Sedberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sedberg</span> was in the lake district, a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with -- which had a -- one of these what’s called public schools, which of course are these very, very private schools in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lake district</span> , a beautiful town with -- which had a -- one of these what’s called <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , which of course are these very, very private schools in England. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And 1-1t was pleasant, very pleasant to be there, first time a chance to go out and go to dances, and go to m-mix with the population, started having a girlfriend, things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Also, the other thing was my father had a cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And I’d never met them, but I knew they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And so one Sunday I hitchhiked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">York</span> , and I came to know my father’s cousin, who was the owner of a very, very successful <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in -- 1-1n -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I’d heard about him, but I’d never been there, I’d never been in touch with these people, but I just happened to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And on -- ona Sunday afternoon, and I happened to find them at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He had bought up a patent in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> for a plastic which has what we would now call -- basically the structure of nylon. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But he made it -- he made it out of the milk that was rejected from the chocolate ma -- making process. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And he sold this -- his idea to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Roundtree</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">York</span> , the famous chocolate company, and he ec -- he got -- got their waste product, and he made this plastic which was called not Bakolite, but Gansolite, because his name was Gans, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And they had this big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> there, very successful, and his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> really -- which was also one of these beautiful <span class="DLF">estates</span> , almost in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">York</span> , his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was sort of the rallying point for all of us Gans and related families from the American and British army, who happened to be in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And this was -- this was a very, very nice c- contact, and a very nice connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I volunteered for every -- every damn thing that could be, to get me out of the Pioneer Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="772"><span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was now alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">You know, the United States was not in -- not in the war, and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was -- had successfully divided <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was not in -- not in the war, and Russia was -- had successfully divided Poland with hi -- with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So they were not in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So the 1 -- the British had the idea that the only way they could possibly inflict a lot of damage on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was to have a huge Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So they were looking for volunteers for people to go into the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Well, I went to the examination, and all -- the examination was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blackpool</span> , which was -- was about two or three hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride from where -- from where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Passed the examination, was accepted in, but of course they -- they didn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">When they f -- looked at my nationality they refused to let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But I had the -- I ha -- for ye -- for a long time I carried around this piece of paper which showed that I had passed the part of the acceptance process for the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So that didn’t work out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  And when is this now? </span><span class="sentence" id="783">What point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  This is n -- this is now -- now, wait a minute, let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">This is 19 -- it’s nine 1940 -- four ni- °4]. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It’s 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And this -- you know, in -- in the meantime of course, th -- round about -- I think it was in the spring of 1941, there was this meeting between Elizabeth and chur -- Churchill on the high seas. </span><span class="sentence" id="788"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was still not in the war, but <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had -- was giving for free, 50 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">destroyers</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> on generally supporting -- supporting the British war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">But th -- Roosevelt could of course not go and -- and join in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">There was far too much isolationism in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to allow him to declare war, but he was actually supporting the British in their war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And then in the summer of 1941, I don’t know the exact date any more -- of course, from one minute to the other, Hitler moved his armies against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It’s apparently just totally expected by both the British and the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">They had made all the provisions just what -- what they were going to do when this event would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I wish I would have copy [indecipherable] if you could get it off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> that Churchill made that night when -- when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">It’s -- it’s very applicable to our present situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">He said something like I won’t take back anything I have said against Communism, but I see a people now being faced with a totally different ideology. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I see the ordinary Russian people, and -- be -- being faced with an -- a representative of an ideology that 1s totally alien to them, and I’m sure they will resist against it. [</span><span class="sentence" id="798">indecipherable] all this was -- I -- I -- I have to find the actual speech. [</span><span class="sentence" id="799">-I-It’s -- it’s very, very significant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  And this whole time you were in the Pioneer Corps, still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Now -- I were -- things were loosening up. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">They allow -- we were allowed to -- we were getting weps -- we were now subject to weapons training, and felt more -- by this time, I think we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">As a matter of fact, I -- we were working in a anti-aircraft unit that was the first mixed sex -- sex mixed anti-aircraft unit in the -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And it was a very, very interesting experience, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Also some very lovely girls there, no doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And later on we went to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> , and we worked -- we started working building an <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> for -- let me see, can’t remember exact date any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I think by this time -- can’t remember the date, six -- ha-have -- have to think this out, but I have a feeling that we were building this <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> for the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So that must have been after Pearl Harbor then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  And when did you get this rare opportunity that then came your way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, I -- I volunt -- volunteered for everything, and I think it was the end of 1942, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">By that time I had made my name in the -- in the unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">See, you know, th-these -- these Pioneer Corps units were full of people who were -- who knew how to boast, and push themselves forward very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">They were all experts at everything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And I -- I, of course, I never participated very much in -- in -- in sports that were open to many people, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Well, one day I remember we had a -- they were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of like a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 meter, you know, this is actually one round on -- and that was the major event there. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And of course there were all these guys there who had been such champions in all their Maccabee clubs, and God knows, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="BUILDING">Maccabee clubs</span> , and God knows, all over the place. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Well, I did the run, and I won it so easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And now I had made my name, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I -- I -- I hadn’t realized myself how -- how -- how f -- much better I was at sports than all these people who were so -- boasting continuously about their powers, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="821">A-And I knew when w-we were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> at the time, and we were billeted on pr -- in private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> -- you know, we were not eating there, but were -- just slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Had a -- had a -- when -- I remember when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I knew this was going to be the change of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And so it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">When eventually the call came for people to go to something very, very special, I was one of the first who was s-selected to -- but there being -- after this event, we started a -- we competed in many, many different sports events, and I was always very much the center of everything of the team that was sent by our unit, to all these sports event -- events, and I’ve -- I’ve -- I was running on -- on -- on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">cloud</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So I think it was at the end of 1942 that I was -- went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and I was interviewed by a man who had the uniform of a captain, and who obviously knew an awful lot, and knew what he wanted, and that turned out to be eventually the skipper, you know, he’s -- he’s all on the pictures there. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I -- I s-should have gone through these pictures before with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">QUESTION:  Yeah, well you can show me at the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  We can look at them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  And also then, we were interviewed by somebody from MI-five, who was supposed to make sure all on your background, and -- very knowledgeable people, very, very knowledgeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">You know this [indecipherable] combination of the CIA and the FBI. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And I was absolutely sure that I had been accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I had no doubts about it whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And then, a few weeks later, or two weeks later, the [indecipherable] called to the [indecipherable] told me, and maybe three or four others to go to the Pioneer Corps center in -- in <span class="REGION">Yorkshire</span> <span class="BUILDING">Pioneer Corps center</span> in -- in Yorkshire. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I think it was in Yorkshire, horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And there -- from there we were taken on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> by night, and the next morning we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abu Dhabi</span> , which was the training pl-place for [indecipherable] commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And there we changed our names, changed our identities. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Within two hours, we all -- we had a false history, a false name, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And that was the beginning of the -- being in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commandoes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  What was your false name and your background, your identity you were given?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  My name was Fred Gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I spelled it a-y. And we were all s-supposed to say that we were British by -- by nationality, but that our fathers, our parents had been assigned to such and such a- m-my case it was, of course, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , since I spoke some Dutch, it was easy to do, had been assigned to -- to -- had -- had lived in -- in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And so that’s the reason why we had grown up in -- abroad, but we were British by nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  What was the main qualifying factor for being part of this troop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  That you spoke German without an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">This was extremely important. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">We didn’t realize it at that time, how important this would [indecipherable] be. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I only can ta -- give you one statistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I must have caused the surrender of about 10,000 Germans [indecipherable] without a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I didn’t -- I didn’t -- we didn’t realize it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">We were supposed to do long distance patrols, we were supposed to do interrogation on -- on the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> , which we did, and which were very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">No doubt these were very important, because you know, we could interrogate the prisoners right there and then on the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And we had been trained for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I had been to the intelligence school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> , in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="BUILDING">intelligence school</span> in Cambridge, in -- in England. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And so -- and that -- that was extremely important, no doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">But the ability to walk into a German position and persuade people to surrender without fighting, proved more important than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">A-Anything else we learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">After all, we learned everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Mountaineering, parachute jumping. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Anythi -- we’d done any -- everything there was to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">But it -- the -- the ability to walk into a ger -- walk into a German position and talk to them as if you were one of them, this was the main contribution, as it turned out to be, for the war for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  They would see you, of course, in your uniform, and you would appear to be, you know, a British, you know, soldier, or -- you know, but -- but you’re saying the fact that you spoke without an accent was also more convincing to them, somehow, to get them to surrender?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  Yeah, ju -- obviously there had to be some sort of infiltration and some fights before that, which you may have read about in the stories in which I wrote about [indecipherable] when we did this repeatedly, or in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">You -- there had to be some sort of infiltration before that, but once you were in that position, you -- then we were very, very persuasive. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Don’t threaten them with a gun, just tell them quick how many -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">This is tape number three, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Again, they said that was not necessarily what was planned for us, but this was what turned out to be our greatest asset.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">QUESTION:  Who was in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span> , the numbers of people, and what was their background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">ANSWER:  There were 87 people in the troop, and they were all, I think this -- with the exception of one or two, they were all German or Austrian Jews, meaning Jews by the t -- by Hitler’s definition. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">A lot of them by wh-what we call Halachak definitions are not Jewish, because they had a -- a Jewish father, and a non-Jewish mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Quite a number of those, quite a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Of course you know a couple like that had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> very early, otherwise life was impossible for them, and a lot of them did leave very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">So by what we used to call Halachak Jewish law, Jewish [indecipherable] maybe 75 percent of us were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  And was this -- do you think this was an important qualification that -- that they were looking for, that the British actually chose Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t choose Jews, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Those -- Montgomery -- I’m sorry, Lord Mountbatten. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Lord Mountbatten, who was in charge of combat operation, who was -- you know, he’s -- is the uncle of, you know, Prince Philip, the husband of the queen, he da -- his -- I think his parents had gone through some sort of experience in World War One, and he was in combat -- in charge of combined operation, which consisted of the units of the army, largely commanders, Air Force, and Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And he came up with the idea that he had to have German speakers somewhere, and that he needed really good German speakers, so he -- he sold that idea to Churchill, and Churchill was very enthused about it, and Churchill said that the troops should be called X- troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">But of course that name had to be dropped, it was too suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And then, you know, we became a [indecipherable] of the inter-allied commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">That’s how we were -- were -- how we were known. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Was a commando which had units, Belgian units, French units, Polish unit -- units, Norwegian unit, and well, that’s about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  So previously I never knew about this troop, do y -- and I’m wondering if -- 1f it seems like it’s been -- not only at the time, I guess it was kept secret, and -- but has it been sort of a well kept secret even -- even now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Well, it’s just -- not kept secret, but you know, we all went our different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">The -- the skipper, the head of the troop got injured in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you know, on a long term patrol, and he was taken prisoner, and he was -- did not return until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">He wrote a very nice assessment of the troop back in 1946 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And -- you know, we were all, after the war we were all -- we -- we didn’t particular think that we had done such great things. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">We were -- we were involved in our own careers, had to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Potential wives, girlfriends, were not interested in what we had done during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">What they wanted was to get married and make sure that we had enough money to -- to have children and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And particularly this was the attitude of -- of the parents of all our potential wives and girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">So the whole idea was not really -- we da -- we -- we didn’t care to -- we didn’t have any reunions until maybe the 40" anniversary of D- Day, and wh-what was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="892">That would have been in 1984, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I -- I think that the first one was 1984. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And of course it’s the -- Peter Maas’s book that really brought all this out into the open, better than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">QUESTION:  Did you realize at the time how unusual this was, that you were, you know, Jewish, and able to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to fight and obviously eventually go to an <span class="REGION">area</span> where, you know, Jews were so persecuted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">ANSWER:  Yes, we -- I was very much aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I was very much aware, and so were my friends, that this was something totally unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">My -- my closest friends were very, very supportive of all this, and they realized what were -- what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">But it -- but 1t remained a unique experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We -- and, you know, my experience of course was very -- almost very different from everybody else’s experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">First of all, I refused to go to the officer’s training school. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I didn’t want to miss the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">My -- my closest friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to officer training school for four months just before D-Day, and of course they missed most of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I absolute refused to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I wer -- and then there came an order from the British army command that people were not to be promoted to officers in their <span class="DLF">field</span> without going to officer’s training school. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Well, I didn’t care two hoots about it, but 1t so happens that of course I was attached to a Marine unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And the Marines didn’t have to take any notice of all these army un1- units. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I was with the Marine commando, and one day they colonel said, “Tell me who you really are. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I -- I want to make -- I want to put you in for be-becoming an officer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  So speaking of your other identity, what was that like to assume a different identity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">ANSWER:  Oh, it was very handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">You know, I -- I had no difficulty with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And you have -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> you have the desire to submerge yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">It’s not like American society. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">You know, if you tell -- in those days, it’s very different now, very different now, in those days if you told a British person -- a British person, I’m going to be naturalized, and become British, and they would say, “You? </span><span class="sentence" id="917">You’re not British.” </span><span class="sentence" id="918">You know, tha -- but here, people -- you come in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and it’s -- the people ask you when are you going to get your naturalization, or have you gotten it already, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And braka -- hurry up, and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Totally different attitude in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But -- so. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">you had a desire in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to submerge yourself and pretend that -- were -- to be something that you were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And -- so that suited in very, very handily. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Of course, I had to give up being an Orthodox Jew, in doing that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="925">But --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How difficult was that for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">ANSWER:  Well, let’s -- it was part of -- this was part of the sacrifice you make. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I want to tell you a story which is very, very interesting, I’ve -- I’ve not told it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">When we were in the Isle of Mann in the inte -- internment camp -- as I said, we were Orthodox Jews living together, there was a man there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Isle of Mann</span> in the inte -- internment camp -- as I said, we were Orthodox Jews living together, there was a man there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Rabbi Spitzer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was known as a great Talmudist, very ultra-Orthodox who had come out of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to become a- arabbi, chief rabbi of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">His son was regarded to be far superior to the father, as far as brain and knowledge was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And one day t -- one day to the other, the son decided that a rabbinical career was not for him, and he wanted to go into law. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">He knew Talmudic law fantastically, and he then went and became -- took his legal papers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Of course he couldn’t practice by the time he’d finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So, you know, he couldn’t be a lawyer, Jewish lawyer in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But he was with me in there, in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which I was in -- on the Isle of Mann. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And he -- he was a tall man, good looking man, always -- he did not run around with a yarmulke, he run -- was running around with [indecipherable] golf cap -- golf cap [indecipherable], but I mean, he was a ultra, ultra-Orthodox Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Extremely well versed. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I mean, a lot of the things which I have learned, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and Jewish law, I’ve learned from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Well, the day when we -- we volunteered, when I and two or three other people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> volunteered for the British army, it came out -- we went into our dining room where -- which was the only common <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> where -- which was the only common room there was, and we announced to people there that -- what we had done, that we volunteered for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">There was a fellow there by the name of Josele. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Well, Josele was a devoted Yeshiva student, absolute -- not too brilliant, absolutely devoted to -- to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">He got very, very upset, and he said, “If y -- you -- what you doing 1s you will have to work on Saturdays, you’ll hardly be able to eat kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">You will have to starve yourself to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">This -- the fact that you volunteer for this army, it just goes to show that you put your secular existence far above your Jewish consciousness.” </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And in the corner was this ra -- Spitzer, the lawyer rabbi, and he was sitting behind his books. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And he came out, he -- he looked up from his book, and he said, “But Josele,” -- remember, this in 1940, “it’s -- 1t’s not a mitzvah -- mitzvah to fight Hitler?” </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Josele, he had a totally different -- totally different attitude to this -- to -- he saw the larger implication, in spite of the fact that by that time there had no -- not been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , mass extermination and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">You know, after all this was all st -- still to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But it stuck -- stuck -- stuck into my mind, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did that influence you at the time, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">ANSWER:  Yeah, and this, you know, this is -- this is why I was willing to accept -- accept whatever it meant, or whatever I had to do, because -- including giving up being an Orthodox Jew, when the time came to be at the commandoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  Now, while you were in the commando, did you still, in your own personal and private way, was religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  It’s a -- ina sort of general way, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">But you know, there was too many other things we had to concentrate on to -- to even start thinking about all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I -- I -- to me the Jewish religion is a set of ideas which I practice, and it’s -- I -- I’m not that comfortable in praying because the prayers to me are -- have a great depth, but they are an idiom that we cannot relate to. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And just as you find in a lot of ultra Orthodox Jews, they rather sit down and study the Talmud than go and do -- do prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And -- and you know, this is -- so you had a guidance there, and -- when it was absolutely needed, but that wasn’t very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And I -- when I was in difficult situations, I did not- not pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I remember that one [indecipherable] one -- you may have read this story I written about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pontlivek</span> , when I suddenly found myself in this German artillery fire, very much exposed, and I just -- I -- you know, I s -- I sort of said, get me out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="959"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bus</span> -- was addressing wa -- I was obviously addressing a higher authority, like God or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And -- but it -- 1t required moments of that nature to make -- to make me -- to make me even think about -- about religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Normally the concentration had to be all on techniques. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Going through a <span class="DLF">minefield</span> , doing this and that and the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Always a technique we had [indecipherable] out. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">You had to concentrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">There was no time to -- to think of anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And that’s [indecipherable] made it all possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  So tell me about D-Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">You -- is this the first time that you -- you entered --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  -- into actual war time fighting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  Yes, it -- yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">We had -- we had been -- we had tried to do certain raids on <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> before D- Day, by parachute, and certain missions were planted, or didn’t come off, some of them, bec -- because we always -- when you were -- when a -- when a force like that went out by parachute, they had to go out with the massive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> that attacked the American and British bombers that attacked [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British bombers</span> that attacked [indecipherable] Germany at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">So you had to blend in, and then you drop -- you drop out and do certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Well, none of these things came off, partially because of bad weather, partially because the information was obtained from different means and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So, though we had been prepared for certain raids, and some of us had been on certain raids, I personally had not been in any actual fight until D-Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We were sequestered -- oh, let me go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">The -- our troop, the German speaking inter-allied commando troop was split up just before D-Day, when there were four or five of us attached to every invading commando troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I was assigned together with a fellow by the name of Morris Latimer, whose -- and the Sergeant Major of the troop, O’ Neill, and a fellow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">These are all these cover names of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi from the Sudetenland before he joined that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">So we were assigned to 41 [indecipherable] Marine commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And we were held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for I think two or three weeks while we were being briefed about the landing. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And w -- we couldn’t communicate with anybody <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because those -- they were -- didn’t tell us where we would land. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We knew -- we had -- we saw maps, for which people who really knew <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> well could have guessed where this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">But I’m -- we personally, we didn’t know where it was going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We didn’t know we were going to land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">So we were in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for about two or three weeks, and then one evening, total darkness, we were -- we embarked into little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , infantry landing boats, which had -- each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> had maybe something like 80 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And the -- all flotilla set out without light, without any intercommunication, in a pitch dark night. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">We sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkness, couldn’t see anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And -- and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came closer to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o’clock in the morning by the time we landed. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment of the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And one of us always sat on the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running commentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the German [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Lucky tha -- luckily we were not hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And now, before all this, while we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montgomery</span> , the a -- the British commander had come around, and he had said, “Look, every time there’s a <span class="DLF">landing</span> , everybody sticks to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> because they want to be protected by the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Get off the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">You can -- don’t,” -- and that struck me as being very, very significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">The really tr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn’t get away from the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So, when -- when the -- the -- the -- our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> approached the -- the <span class="DLF">coast</span> -- and of course as I said, we now were under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the <span class="DLF">gangway</span> , and I got -- got down -- was on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and lo and behold, I saw about 25 German soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the engineer’s unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the obstacles, the anti- tank obstacles that were on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them, ‘“‘Where’s the pass through the <span class="DLF">minefields</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I didn’t have any fear of <span class="DLF">mines</span> any more, but at that time I still was very much aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And lo and behold, when I didn’t threaten them, and, you know, about being -- talking their own language, the first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Different uniform and they could be on our side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And lo and behold they told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I didn’t threaten them, I had the tommy gun down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I just said, in a very calm way, “Where’s the pass through the <span class="DLF">mine fields</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And they pointed it out to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I’d gotten through the -- gotten off the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single casualty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50 percent of the unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Later on, when we made the landing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washoe</span> , in -- which was much more heavily defended than the Normandy beaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the <span class="DLF">landing</span> <span class="DLF">Normandy beaches</span> , much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the landing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">But by that time we were so experienced that nobody could come equal to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And everybody did the same as I did, get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , get over the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> , forget about it and get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">QUESTION:  So this was the -- the end of D-Day for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">This was the beginning of D-Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the German strong points were, and we were at the other end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Luckily, the pass through the mine field was at one end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> <span class="DLF">mine field</span> was at one end of Lyon sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I had no doubt where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I knew we were at the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> , we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Why should they be out on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French villages</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">The French who have murdered them, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So, the first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the <span class="DLF">road</span> that was le -- going towards the German strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I -- and- when it -- when it comes to -- when there’s so much artillery fire and mortar fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">It’s -- the splinters will carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">So you have to go from one <span class="DLF">door</span> to the other, dive in and dive out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And of course the population was on our side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">They willingly opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So I says you know, you couldn’t do this in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">We knew that we would never be able to do this type of street fighting in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we didn’t intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it- had come to the same conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So we were diving from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> into the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">In some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment by one <span class="NPIP">side</span> or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the <span class="DLF">road</span> first, there were some British soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> when the -- when a shell exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So we worked our way- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">When we got into this <span class="NPIP">position</span> where we thought we were about in the view of the strong point, we knew there was an anti-tank gun pointing at us down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , we got off the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we got into [indecipherable] abandoned <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And I went upstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have seen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">So I rushed downstairs again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">I think I -- so I went down into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, when we heard a loud bang on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And ta -- so -- obviously some missile was going from our <span class="NPIP">side</span> into the strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So we really didn’t know what the hell this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">We were absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">So we went there, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient in those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And he was with us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- °45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go with him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had now taken up around the German strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And I went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And he was one of those guys who wouldn’t take no notice of any German fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">He was running around with a briefcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">His name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spelled it with e-y, and not a-y like I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And he -- he wouldn’t throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a mortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn’t going to do this, so I dodged the way I’d learned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was out of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">But then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main <span class="DLF">road</span> to -- on -- on to the German strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Which was crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">The way we did this later on, we used armored vehicles, and even <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored vehicles</span> , and even tanks, only as mobile guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">We had them -- h-hid them somewhere in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Anyhow, this attack totally failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I didn’t participate in it because I knew it would -- would be practically suicide to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack, because as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was a German [indecipherable] <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> pointing right down the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">There was no chance that an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored car</span> could get by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">So we hadn’t -- we hadn’t -- we had not succeeded in taking the strong point on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">By now it was getting late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">We were in a -- on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> somewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungry, and I -- I found myself of -- a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> that had a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I took cover, and start -- started to prepare some of the food which we had, it was -- I hadn’t eaten all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I don’t think we had eaten during the night either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">There was cocoa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">There was -- I mean, there were drinks available, but I -- I didn’t take strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And jus -- just at that time, the -- there was a magnificent sight of massive numbers of allied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> , British gliders come -- being pulled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British gliders</span> come -- being pulled by airplanes coming over, to land on the other side of <span class="DLF">Lyon canal</span> , and they were sort of -- you know, you

<p>ANSWER:  So this shows that things were proceeding along the way they were planned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Also, by this time a German fighter came over and flew right along the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And you know it says in the book the longest day? </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">That’s -- he got away with it, nobody shot at him, but that wasn’t true, lots of people shot at him, of course, nu -- none of us hit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But, you know, it -- one fighter alone could not make much of a difference, probably sent in to scare people off, but it didn’t -- couldn’t -- it wouldn’t work in our case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So this was the first -- this was D-Day, it was the end of D-Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I slept very well that night in my <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Next morning, we continued what we were supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed to conquer <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> , move it inland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">We were supposed to get the Lyon sur Mer strong point, and we were supposed to get into Luc sur Mer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">We had to -- not succeeded doing in any idle -- any of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">So, next morning the first thing we -- it was decided we’ ll attack the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> in -- inland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Well, that didn’t tu-turn -- it wasn’t much of a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">This happens to be a battalion that had just come from the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and they were pretty decimated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And we decided we were not going to go with covering fire, we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which came off beautifully. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And s -- I found three Germans there who were obviously volgama -- the Germans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they’re -- very hard to understand them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I tried to get some more information from them, but they proved t- totally useless. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So then I turned around to take part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but by the time I arrived there, the strong point had given up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And th -- so, I was late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">They -- I don’t exactly know how -- I think it was B troop of 41 commando that was under the leadership of -- of very, very good officer, whom I had accidentally met already a year ago before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And he managed to apparently get -- infiltrate his people into the strong point, and get the strong point to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">So we went on, and the next stage was very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">We got into Luc sur Mer very easily, and this -- this was the far end of the British Canadian landing, and now we were at the <span class="DLF">border</span> of the American and British beach head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And that was supposed to be our D-Day assignment, so this was the end of -- of our D-Day assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  Now for the rest of the war, if you could give me a sense just generally, the kind of movements where you -- where you -- you know, what kind of <span class="REGION">territory</span> you covered in general, and maybe there are a few things that -- that come to mind that particularly illustrate the kinds of things you were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I’m also interested, especially when you were able to get Germans to surrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">ANSWER:  I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don’t think I ever -- ever was in that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">My idea was get as many of them to surrender as you can -- can get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Find some high ranking officer who will go with you and make everybody surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">This -- this has worked out to be ex -- excellent strategy, and this worked ma-many, many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Now, I must say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this and did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost was in a similar situation, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a rather unique experience besieging two underground <span class="BUILDING">German radar stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">They had been left behind in the allied advance, and they were fully manned, and they were hev -- very, very heavily fortified, incredibly heavily fortified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And it was just decided that it was not worthwhile to make an attack -- a direct attack on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So we were positioned around them, near -- near them, and we were just as -- supposed to keep them on their toes, make believe that they were about to be attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned to build an air -- airp -- <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away from these <span class="BUILDING">radar stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were <span class="DLF">fields</span> there that were suitable for landing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircrafts</span> on it, and this had to go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And they couldn’t take any notice of the fact that these ger -- these underground fortifications were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">So our task was to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And -- which we -- which we successfully managed to do for about a week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">There were a lot of adventures that we had, where we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two later when we had much more experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Again, I managed to get these guys out, to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them down to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , to the -- t-to -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prisoner camps</span> of which there were there, but we shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">That was an interesting experience which I’ve written up in great detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">If you want to read, you can read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern front of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev -- very heavily fortified, which was still the extension of what the Germans call the <span class="DLF">Atlantic wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war, because the -- we were always going along or through some <span class="DLF">hedgerows</span> to get to our -- to find the German alliance, so [indecipherable], a-and th-this was a -- a -- oh, of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience, but we managed to keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols, and usually I had to go out on every damn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> there was, because by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would hardly ever go out unless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the radar stations and he had went back to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="BUILDING">radar stations</span> and he had went back to -- to England. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">The Sergeant Major O’Neill was still with me, swent -- Tommy Swentin had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on deeplus two or three, he said he was shell- shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And O’Neill was still there, but he was largely with the officers, so I hardly ever saw them -- saw him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  Now let me ask you, the Germans you encountered along the way, did any of them question you and th -- and even, you know, wonder if you’re Jewish, and -- did you -- that ever come up, was that ever a problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">As a matter of fact, that was the un -- unbelievable attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">If somebody spoke to them in fluent German, they thought that well, you know, we are -- we have -- of such high culture, of course other people speak our language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">QUESTION:  So they wouldn’t even guess that you were originally German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1130">ANSWER:  No, no, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Nobody even dreamt of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">It was -- it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And that I think is a -- a -- you know, of course ga -- cultured pe-people speak German, naturally, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And I’m sure you speak German, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">If you don’t, you’re not cultured.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So -- yeah, and from -- from that -- so we got on the -- on the northeastern part of the -- of the -- of the Normandy beach head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">From there we shifted over to something absolutely terrible, the southeastern part, the southeastern corner of the beach head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">Again, this was the -- the only thing that was lucky about it is there ha-had been a British guards battalion there before us, they had dug some way with <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">We were now something like, maybe maximum 200 - 300 yards away from the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And the bombardment was day and night, mortars, artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Artillery is all right because you know it goes off and you can hear it coming and you know what to do, throw yourself into a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">But the mortar fires were -- could be very surprising, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">We -- we -- we le -- it was o -- it was a lot like being in World War One, it was trench warfare practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">But at night again, we went out on patrol, shot up patrols, we got shot up on -- on patrol and things like that until one day -- of course we were very much aware of the fact of what was happening on the other <span class="NPIP">fronts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">The fact that the Americans were breaking through and going south, that they were going west into <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> , and that they were swinging around as the British -- had been a terrible mass I-losses of germ -- of two and a half German divisions in one night with that -- were poised for counterattack on -- on the British advance, th - the Germans had not -- thought that they could keep this counterattack of two and a half German divisions secret, but they -- but of course it was all seen from the <span class="DLF">air</span> , with the ability that the British Air Force had to -- to look at all German movements, and so it came in with a very heavy -- before the -- the Germans could even start to move, came in with a very, very heavy thousand bombers attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And most of these two and a half -- the people of the two and a half divisions -- SS divisions, they -- they died through lack of ox -- oxygen, or lack of -- or ho -- of hi -- excessively high pressure that they ex-experienced being out in the open, being ready for counterattack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">That was -- then -- that was a -- none of these divisions appeared again for the rest of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">They were SS divisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">QUESTION:  What was the most frightening episode that you experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1152">ANSWER:  I think that, you know, sus-sustained frightening, was the position we were in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pontlivek</span> , because we were a cross <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the Germans are at one <span class="NPIP">side</span> in a railway -- in a railway station and we were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and we were be -- behind <span class="DLF">walls</span> at [indecipherable] but we knew the <span class="DLF">walls</span> <span class="NPIP">cross place</span> , the Germans are at one side in a railway -- in a <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and we were on the other side, and we were be -- behind walls at [indecipherable] but we knew the walls were -- would not stand -- would not stand a anti-tank gun shot, and we knew that the Germans usually left -- with their rear guards they usually left an anti-tank gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And that would have gone right through us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But v-very soon -- th-this was realized that we were in too exposed a <span class="NPIP">position</span> , and we were told to get -- get out of this <span class="NPIP">position</span> and just -- because also, the Germans had left devices in -- in all the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , which w -- suddenly all the -- all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> around us went on fire, and -- you know, this was a sustained, longer experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">But we managed to get out of this, and get out and then we did what we did -- always did, we defeated ma -- we made 10 night attacks in 10 days in that -- that -- during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">So we were taken out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pontlivek</span> , was decided what we’ll do is we -- we’ll go around on the night attacks, and we sa -- we go past them, and don’t do a frontal assault anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">QUESTION:  So, were you at some point starting to imagine that the war might be coming to an end? </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">When did you start to get a feeling that -- you know, that -- that this might actually be close to the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">ANSWER:  Not until very, very much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I -- even when I -- the first time I got back into my own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borken</span> , which was Easter Saturday, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had been taken on the Thursday, Thursday, that Thursday before Easter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I knew about it, and you know, by that time I -- I was an officer, I could move around as I wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Everybody supported me, and I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borken</span> , and we -- even at that time we realized that things were not over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And you know, actually there were quite a number of people from sweep of troop -- tank commandoes, who were killed before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">You know, this is hundred miles away, this is almost on the -- on the <span class="DLF">line</span> with -- where the two armies, the Russian and the -- a-and the ar -- western forces met. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Even there, there was still resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">It -- 1t was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">We knew this fa -- and they were fanatics, these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And the closer it was getting <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to them, the c-ca -- th-the worse it got, and we had absolutely no illusion about it, that -- that there was still some heavy fighting ahead of us at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">We had -- we si -- it so happens that they -- they -- you know, we were on the Dutch -- Dutch front, it never lit up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">We -- we never personally were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">But at any moment we could have been told get over to this and this and this position, and that would have been -- and there would have been real fanatical resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">There was a very good friend of mine, a German writer, who wrote a -- a book called, “Five Minutes Before Midnight,” where he describes how there’s last minute resistance in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , all the time, and of course he says this -- this led to the destruction of all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in -- in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home district</span> , because there were always some fanatics who said they could hold out, and you had -- you had to -- had to take care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Quite apart from the fact that we just knew if there was going to be an invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , we were going to be in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">This unit had been in the invasion of <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> , had been in the inva -- invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , had -- we had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">We had done the invasion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washoe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">There -- no way was there going to be an invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> without us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">So, the war was not over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">QUESTION:  And you were -- were you able to, you know, have enough strength throughout? </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Was this -- you know, did you get used to living with just always having a certain amount of fear, or did that fear go away after awhile?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">ANSWER:  No, w-we [indecipherable] particularly after we -- we felt very much experienced, battle experienced, superior to the -- to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Better -- we were better equipped, we knew how to move better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">A lot of their strength had gone out by too fanatical resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">The fear -- the fear was not a real condition any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">Ve -- very, very confident what we could do, particularly after the -- during and after the Washoe invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">It was a -- was a terrific morale booster for us that everything had gone so smoothly against incredible fortifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So -- so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Where were you at the end of the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Where had you gotten to at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">ANSWER:  We were still in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , in -- you know, the -- that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> never surrendered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Th-the Germans never surrendered at all until I don’t know wh -- well after -- even after we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">So, you know, I had heard through people who had been -- go-gotten to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> in this exchange of Eichmann’s, of Jews against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , that my parents were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , so I was set to go there at the earliest possible moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1191">QUESTION:  When is the last time you had actually heard from them, or corresponded with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1192">ANSWER:  I would say in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">There were still Red Cross letters, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">A -- long before I went into the commandoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">That was the last time I [indecipherable] then they went -- they went into hiding too, but of course they got betrayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">That’s one story I’ve never written up and my brother is always telling me to write that up, that story, because I confronted that guy, and he finally got 10 years <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for -- but he done a lot of other things apart from betraying my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">He had s-sold all the weapons of the Dutch underground to the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">When -- he wasn’t a Communist, no way, but he was after money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">He was state detective. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So at the end of the war, you -- you didn’t know what had happened to your parents, but you started to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">How did you hear about them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Who -- who told you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1204">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, there was this exchange of Jews against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and some of these had gotten to -- family had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">They wrote to my uncle in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , saying that my parents were in ter -- Terezin, and he wrote it t -- to my younger brother, who was still -- whose address he still knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Of course that nobody knew what I was doing, or where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I had a cover address and all that, and eventually that news got to me, that they were in -- probably in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And this is why I decided I want to try to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">So after -- soon as I got permission to do that, I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and a driver, and we drove all across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into the Sudetenland, which had not surrendered yet, still German divisions, it was still real German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Then we drove into the Russian lines, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> <span class="DLF">Russian lines</span> , and Terezin had been liberated by the Russians just two days before I came there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1211">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1212">ANSWER:  This was -- I think I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> on May 12", so I think it was -- must be May 12" I got there, or May 11", something like -- or maybe it wa -- somewhere around that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">It was two -- two or three days after -- after V-E Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1214">QUESTION:  So, first of all tell me a little bit about the journey to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Was it a -- a difficult journey, what -- what was it like, and what did you see along the way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  The -- the journey was hard for us because we had so much trouble with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">But you know, you could always drive into some British or <span class="BUILDING">American repair station</span> , and they didn’t fuss around very much, they gave you new wheels, they gave you new -- new shock absorbers, new brakes, whatever you have -- whatever you needed could always be obtained pretty rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">But then, you know, once we left there, w-we ca -- first we came accidentally into the <span class="DLF">Russian line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I hadn’t wanted to do this, so I went back into the -- went back to <span class="DLF">American lines</span> , spent the night there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I described it in great detail in my report. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And then, next morning we set out and we crossed over into unconquered territory, the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has [indecipherable] to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">That’s the northern foothills of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atz mountains</span> of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Sudeten mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And it was an interesting experience to see <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as it had been, officers strutting around and so on, but of course I couldn’t stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And we went up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and came across two and a half German divisions that were still there, f-fully armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And they, I’m sure, are the same divisions as I menti- as I mentioned -- as -- as mentioned in the story of -- Schindler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">You remember the Schindler story? </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">That when -- when they -- when he was going [indecipherable] to be rushed into the <span class="DLF">American lines</span> from the <span class="DLF">Russian lines</span> , they -- he -- he -- he came across two -- two and a half German divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I’m sure that those were the same divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Anyhow, we crossed that, went down, and finally hit the <span class="DLF">Russian lines</span> , and it was -- the Russians were so enthused when they -- everybody wants to shake hands, and embrace you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">You know, the [indecipherable] was a manifestation of these two armies, western armies, and the Russian armies having -- having come together, you know, there must have been millions of such encounters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">But particularly these people whom we met there, they had -- they had not been through this experience at all, and therefore they -- they were just delighted to see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">western allied vehicle</span> fully armed, with people in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">This was their meeting of east and west, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Fa -- I forgot [indecipherable] they looked as if they had come all -- all the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , and this was, you know, the first German defeat in the f -- major German defeat in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and we had come all the way from the <span class="DLF">Normandy beaches</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">QUESTION:  Was it a very emotional time for you as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1235">ANSWER:  N-No, I can’t say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I -- I -- I -- I was -- didn’t feel emotional in those days, I really didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Ther -- they were happy, we were happy, it was a great experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">This is what we had looked forward to, and -- [interruption]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Yeah, the attitude, thank God, was -- that I had was different, that’s right. ... </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I am -- when -- when -- when I got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, you know, and again the officer at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the troops who were guarding the <span class="DLF">exit</span> there, he wanted to shake hands, you know, make his contact with the western allied army, and then he said, “Look, there’s one <span class="REGION">area</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in which there’s the -- what you call the zoif --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Typhus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1241">ANSWER:  Typhus, yeah, but he called it zoisha, of course, in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And if your parents are in that, you have to promise me that you’|l come out and not go -- go, forget about seeing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">Otherwise I can’t let you go back into your own army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was this trip dangerous, do you think, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1245">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Now that I think about it, it was just incredible what risks we took. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Was all these -- first of all there’s -- there’s the danger of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> breaking down, what are you going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And the second thing is, the Germans up in the Sudetenland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">They were fully armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">They -- you know, they were there to -- to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">But I -- like -- just like on -- on the -- some of the patrols I did, in open daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">You rely on the fact that they’re not going to shoot at a single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">They’re too surprised to see just a single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> , just like they are too surprised to see -- see a single person coming, approaching them in a friendly way, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">So people don’t have their finger on the trigger in a position of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So that -- that was the second danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Now, the Russians I think were very, very cooperative, but I also -- there were certain situations which I carefully avoided, such as ch -- taking girls out of the -- out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> [indecipherable] be very inviting to do that, but we would have never -- would have never gone back with the Russians, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">This is -- you couldn’t do any of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So there’s question of having enough gasoline, you know, there was no gasoline, and we -- we -- we were just loaded up with gasoline and we had to rely on the fact that we would get back into <span class="DLF">American lines</span> before we run out of -- of gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">So -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">This is tape number four, side B. So tell me about your first impressions when you arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">ANSWER:  Well, first bi -- 1t was -- 1t was a -- pretty shocking experience to see people like this, you know, in their -- their starved state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Some of them -- quite a number of them too weak to even get up -- get out of the way for our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">That’s -- it was a -- that was [indecipherable] impressions, the next impression I had is this -- these are all very familiar faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">These are the Jews amongst who I’ve lived all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">So n-not that it struck me as being so emotional at the time, but this is what I realized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And I don’t know who told me, maybe the Russian guards told me that there’s a registry where I could find out whether my parents were still there, or whether they -- or where they would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">You know, I asked around and found my way to this central registry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And there was still one girl working -- by now it was something like five o’clock in the evening I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">We had been traveling all day long without a break, without stopping for food anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And I p -- asked this girl -- gave her my name of my parents and she s -- she said, “You are extremely lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">They’re still here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">So she said, “I’Il] come with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">So then went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">They were supposed to live in, you know, again you saw this terrible overcrowding, went to -- I left the driver <span class="NPIP">outside</span> of course, and went upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">It was like people everywhere, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">There was just -- there was just no <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">It was like having people move around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">So the girl then went to my parents, she found them, and [indecipherable] and she told them, “I have good news for you, your son 1s here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1280">QUESTION:  Was it overwhelming to you at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1281">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">No feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I was shocked to see my parents in the state they were, particularly my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">I wouldn’t have recognized him, I -- a bit of a shock, y -- 1t was not -- it was not emotional experience at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Now it is, when you think back about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1286">QUESTION:  Why wasn’t it emotional at the time, do you -- do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1287">ANSWER:  No, I just -- Ij -- managed to f-fight down all my feelings for things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Shock yes, but deep emotional, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Now -- now y -- now you remember this and you cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">Most of the time I couldn’t have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">There was no -- no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">There was no -- were not my feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">QUESTION:  Do you think it’s because you had to be so strong and focused on fighting in the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1294">ANSWER:  Yeah, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">Yeah, I mean you had to do without your feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">I mean, you know, it’s -- you have to overcome your feelings when you jump out of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Particular if -- if you jump out of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> through the bottom, and not through the <span class="DLF">side door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Y-Y-You had to s -- just have to s -- s -- concentrate on technique and not -- not get carried away with any emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">Yeah, there’s a good saying was -- they had in the <span class="BUILDING">parachute school</span> , the instructors, they told us always, if you start feeling sorry for yourself, get out of here, you won’t jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Ge -- get out before you have -- before you’re going to get your badge, because you can still ge -- if you get frightened when you -- this was the British army [indecipherable] says, “If you get frightened and want to get out, get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">They let you get out, but once you had your badge, of course, it was your du-duty to go ahead and -- and jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And th-tha-that’s something -- something worthwhile remember, I -- I very often quote -- quote that, if you start feeling sorry for yourself, you won’t jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Y-You know, you can’t feel sorry for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">We’re in the position where -- where we are, just our own choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Maybe not by own choice, but then we can’t help it, and that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1307">QUESTION:  You say that you were shocked the way that your --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My father looked like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1308">QUESTION:  -- father looked, and what di --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I wouldn’t have recognized him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">If I had met him on the <span class="DLF">street</span> I wouldn’t have recognized him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1310">QUESTION:  What -- what was so different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1311">ANSWER:  Well, I mean, he -- he was, you know, he -- he was a well fed man before the war, and people shrivel up, you know, particularly in that situation in which they had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">They totally shrivel up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And he -- you can hardly recognize. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">They age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">I mean that -- you know, after my father had been back in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for two or three weeks, he looked his former self again, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">But people changed totally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">QUESTION:  What about your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1318">ANSWER:  She somehow -- somehow she was slightly different, she was more -- you see, my father not be -- having only one lung and one leg, was probably more subject to -- to these hardships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And my mother somehow had managed to live through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">She worked in the S.S. kitchen, stole -- s- stole the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Had no fear of these people, and somehow got through in a more positive way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">QUESTION:  So what was it like, your -- your first, you know, reunion, what did you talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And -- and tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">ANSWER:  Well, just about everything of course, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">They had been totally cut off from the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">They obviously wanted to ri -- wanted to know what -- what wa -- what had hap -- what was happening to my brothers, and they wanted -- wanted to know about all the other relatives, my mother’s sisters, and my -- my fathers relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">You know, we’re family oriented family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">And they had a -- they -- they were amazed that I was an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">Of course they couldn’t recognize British ranks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">They were amazed that I was a paratrooper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">They had no idea what wa -- all these insignia meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And were absolutely in-incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And they want -- want -- and to -- they told a lot about their experiences, and what had happened, and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the -- then they eventually were joined by other people who wanted to know what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">They were living in what was called the <span class="REGION">Dutch colony</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">You may have heard about the group of young girls, [indecipherable] young girls, who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">My mother was very friendly with them because ya -- ha -- eventually was -- was going to be <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And these -- a lot of these girls came to congratulate my mother, you know, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Mainly they wanted to know what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">They had no idea about the Normandy invasion, only vaguely what -- what had happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">They didn’t know about the total destruction in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">I -- you know, I -- I -- I -- Ij -- I-- I -- I told my father -- he -- he had one [indecipherable] he said, “We can never get r-revenge for this, because we can’t be that cruel.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">So I said to him, “The revenge has been, it’s finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">It’s not what we wanted, but this is ha -- this is what happened.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And I tell him -- told him, in -- there is not a single -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muenster</span> , which was the capital of our <span class="REGION">county</span> , there is not a single <span class="BUILDING">house</span> standing any more between this <span class="DLF">boulevard</span> and that <span class="DLF">boulevard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">It’s like telling you, look there’s not a single <span class="BUILDING">house</span> standing any more between -- between 72" Street, and -- and <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> <span class="DLF">72" Street</span> , and -- and city hall in New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Everything is destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">That gave him a concept of -- of how incredible the destruction had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">When I drove through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muenster</span> , which I had known, through this massive rubble, where -- but you know of course the <span class="DLF">roads</span> had been cleared by American bulldozers, because after all, our armies had to get through, all I met was one woman who was crazy, was on -- on -- on a ha -- on a -- on a -- in black -- in a black dress, with all around was -- that was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bulldozers</span> , because after all, our armies had to get through, all I met was one woman who was crazy, was on -- on -- on a ha -- on a -- on a -- in black -- in a black dress, with all around was -- that was Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">That was the revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">I don’t remember what the -- the divisions, the two and a half S.S. divisions that had been blasted out of the s -- from the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , and that -- that -- that died for lacks of -- lack of oxygen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And they were supposed to be counter-attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">That was revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">Nuremberg trials, none of them -- none of us thought of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">The revenge had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">It was -- 1t was the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1356">QUESTION:  Did a lot of people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> want revenge? </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Is that something they felt --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I don’t know, I didn’t talk to a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">People who -- whom I talked to were t -- were like the justice of -- The Hague court of justice, who gave me a letter to Princess Julianna. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">They - they wanted to have some certain practical things solved, like repatriation in -- in a hurry, and so on and so forth, which -- which I managed to have a hand in arranging later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">You know, it was -- everybody had his own practical needs, nevermind go-going after things like revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">This was a -- a concept that people whom I talked to were not concerned with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">They wanted to -- me to take letters back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">I must have taken something like 500 letters back, which the wife of a friend of mine gave to the Red Cross in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , because of course I didn’t have a postage stamp to send all these things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">So I put them in -- 1n a big parcel, and I got back to my unit in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and she send them to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and the wife of my friend took them to the Red Cross, and they sent them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And apparently most of them did arrive. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1366">phone ringing]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So how did other people react to you when you came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1367">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, they were concerned with practical things like please take a letter for me, and - or do this and this and this for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">One guy came along, and he said, I own two <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zarund</span> , which 1s not very far from our -- my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borken</span> , and I want you to be the -- the manager of these two plants, because if you can come here and win, it’s everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">And I told him, “Look, I’m not out of the army yet, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">It’s a long time pi -- we still have a long war ahead of us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">So people weren’t -- the discussions were not -- not in any of these abstract subjects, they were very, very practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Told them that in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> you had to pay a gilder, which is, you know, a lot of money, for just one potato, but the starvation was like in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , it -- 1t was occupied by the Germans, not in [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And th-those were the things people were interested in, the practical things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1374">QUESTION:  What about the fact that you’d been part of this -- this British commando, and did that come up much, your involvement in -- in -- had they known, you know, anything about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1375">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">They -- they -- they had not known that they -- did not know that there was such a thing as a Jewish brigade, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">They thought it was of -- they -- a lot of them felt 1t was sort of natural. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , so we -- we -- we -- we did the fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">As Peter Maas has once said, ““We were the em-embodiment of all their dreams.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1380">QUESTION:  It seems like maybe it was, you know, an inspiration for them, a-at the end of this experience they’d gone through, to -- to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">Did it feel that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1382">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I think so, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I th -- I think it was -- some of the -- but some of they felt that they -- all right, this -- this is what you ha -- has to do, thank God you did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">We didn’t have the chance to do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1428">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">So, I left, I picked up all these [indecipherable] of wars, went back into the <span class="DLF">American lines</span> , and then th-the generals from these two and a half German divisions, which I had met in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Sudeten mountains</span> came into the <span class="DLF">American lines</span> , and the American com -- local American commander asked me to come with him to make these people surrender to the Russians, because they had fought the Russians and therefore had to surrender to the Russians, that was the agreement we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">That’s -- every German division surrenders to those whom they -- whom they have been fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">So the Americans could not accept their surrender, wouldn’t accept their surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">So we returned them to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Now, so we eventually got back to my unit, and it’s in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I na -- went to see Princess Julianna, who was in ch -- chas -- charge of repatriation, and I gave her the letter, which the justice of [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">court</span> had given me, and she said she wants to talk to me, but I didn’t have a chance to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">That’s it -- later on, because by the time my unit moved on to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and nobody to this day believes that- believes me, but the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we moved into was my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and I had absolutely nothing to do with it, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Nobody will believe this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">What an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">And there we actually -- we were -- we weren’t even the occupation force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">The idea was for us to be equipped with new weapons to get ready for the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">So it wa -- it -- it was of course was incredible experience to be right there in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">We confiscated the best <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to which Jews would never have even been invited before Hitler, and -- [phone ringing] -- Yeah that -- that was quite -- quite an experience, to be back, out of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Well, I just don’t want to get into all the details, but actually [indecipherable] were -- my last job in the army was to be the deputy intelligence officer of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">12,000 people camp</span> , 10,000 men, 2,000 women of high ranking Nazis, largely preparing for the Nuremberg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">A very interesting experience, from every point of view, which I have rarely told anybody about, because even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> today, people do not like some of the things that their relatives experienced while being in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> not -- not that in my opinion they didn’t deserve them, but this is what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1443">QUESTION:  Such as -- such as what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">What’s an example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1445">ANSWER:  Well, you know, people were held in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and -- who were -- who had been say of [indecipherable] of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> had been a guy who -- I only learned about this afterwards, actually -- who -- who had been a judge in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">You know, that’s an automatic arrest category. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">Somebody goes to the judge, German judge in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , can you imagine that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">And, you know, you j -- obviously we were -- w-we prepared a case like that, we pec -- practically condemned the guy to death already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">He di -- that’s not what they did to him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , but they di -- they did get, you know, like the long sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">So somehow or the other, I think there’s still too many Germans around who, if they know it at all about what went on at that time, think that a lot of these things are very unfair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">And they still cannot imagine all the crimes that were committed in -- by say a guy who was a judge in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1452">QUESTION:  How did you feel talking to the Germans, interrogating them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">What’s the name of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you were, and how did you feel about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1454">ANSWER:  [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Well, again, we had a job to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">Th-The British had a very good system of making us filling in certain questionnaire interrogating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">I filled in all the questionnaire with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> , because I typed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German typewriter</span> quite well in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">And I -- I -- I had no pity on any of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">Most of them really deserved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">We had Mr. Armeyer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and you know, he had been a commandant of the -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">And I don’t think before too long, I thought, hey, he was a common criminal, who was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">Hitler was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in the 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">He was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">And so, you know, he stuck to his Nazi regime, that’s how -- how he made his career. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">We had 500 high ranking German officers, who had spent their time in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> during the war, who wouldn’t believe all these stories that were being circulated around about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">So we made up a [indecipherable] I give them a lecture on what happens in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">He describes it in great detail, of how people came in, were -- were -- were -- were put into these so-called showers, which were of course the gas showers. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1468">indecipherable] and we told [indecipherable] who was -- thank God was stupid enough to believe that, that you know, he had got nothing to fear, because after all, he only followed orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">And he described all this to these 500 high ranking German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And these guys were stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Th-They don’t -- there’s a film, “Judgment at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ,” where some -- something similar is being done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">But you know, we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Ours was not fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1474">QUESTION:  Did you feel a lot of resentment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1475">ANSWER:  To whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1476">QUESTION:  To the Germans that you interrogated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1477">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know what -- what you mean by resentment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">What about y -- I -- I felt that these guys had to be brought to justice, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">That we had -- had a to -- a totally different subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">We had a major investigation of the attempt on Hitler’s life in -- in -- when was it, in -- in June 1944 -- July 1944? </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">Was -- was after the invasion, wasn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Was it -- yeah, yeah, it was in July, so it must have been in July 1944, do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1483">QUESTION:  I know you wrote a -- End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">This is tape number five, side A. So I think we were just finishing up talking about when you were interrogating Germans, and I was wondering if you had any other feelings or encounters with not the -- those who had been high S:S. officials, but sort of more the ordinary Germans, and if there were any kind of different feelings you had, or did you kind of hold them responsible in the same way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1485">ANSWER:  I wa -- while I was -- the short time I was an -- actually a military [indecipherable], I -- of course I met a lot of ordinary Germans, and it -- I didn’t have any prejudice against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">I was willing to judge people on the basis of who they -- what they were, and who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">It was the- | -- we were go -- gotten quite friendly, I mean not friendly from the point of view of fraternization, but ma -- with s -- with some of the Germans who were obviously had been -- not been [indecipherable] Nazis, and who were constructive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">We had to work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">Certainly in military government we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">Then, of course, they made the rule, very wisely, that no extra -- extra Jew, or extra [indecipherable] could be in military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">It would be a very good idea if the United States had the same rule for <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had the same rule for Iraq now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">It -- it -- it just 1s -- became -- was a bit of a shock that we had to leave military government, one day to the other, but I think it was an extremely wise decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">They wanted to show the military how -- the British authorities and American authorities wanted to show -- no, I think it’s only the British who did this, they wanted to show that they had confidence in the political leaders who were coming up wer -- like Adenauer and Schumacher, who were now coming up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and that they would not be sidetracked by anybody who had been -- who had left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and who had not gone through the same experience as these political leaders had gone through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1494">QUESTION:  So when were you discharged, and how old were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1495">ANSWER:  I was discharged in August, in ni -- 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">At that time I was 24 years old, and wa -- in -- from one day to the other I changed my name back, I didn’t -- didn’t [indecipherable] to Manfred Gans from Fred Gray, and I was discharged on a Saturday night, and on Sunday morning I started studying for my entrance examination for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , which I -- you know I had of course been back in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> once or twice on -- on leave, and I tried to make arrangements for getting into <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">Now I wanted to go for chemical engineering because I -- there was a government grant for se -- ex-servicemen, and now all these things that I had thought were not possible before the war, were now possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">The results of getting these -- what we -- you c-call in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , G.I. grants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1499">QUESTION:  And by now where’s the rest of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1500">ANSWER:  Well, you know, my parents, of course died in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">They -- they -- my -- my parents went to -- c-came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 19 -- they were here fif -- that must have been [inaudible] I don’t know, 1950 something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">I ca -- and you know they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> until they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">My father died wa -- he was 95, so -- yeah, in ni -- 1980 he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">So they lived a -- a very full life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">Very full, very good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">Course they -- you know, th-they had pensions, and -- and the restitution from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my father fought like blazes for all those things, and he knew how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">So they had a pretty good life.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1509">ANSWER:  My -- ma -- my older brother, of course, was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">My younger brother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1952, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Yeah, ’51 -- it must have been 1952, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Yeah, I think my parents went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1953 or 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1513">QUESTION:  And when did you emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1514">ANSWER:  I came here for the first time in 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">I got married, and I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for good in 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1516">QUESTION:  So I just have a couple overall questions and then we’re done, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">When did you decide to write your memoirs about your experiences, and how long did that take you, and was that a difficult process or -- or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1518">ANSWER:  Well it -- you know, par -- part of it I had written before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">I had written it for my niece in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the one who drew your -- your attention to my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">When she was doing -- she was going in for a master degree, and she felt that all she had to do was to translate my -- my holo -- my tere -- Terezin story, that will be enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">But the authorities didn’t let her get away with that, so she had to pose a large number of questions to me, and I answered those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">And a lot of it came out as such at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">I -- you know, it [indecipherable] about -- must have been in 2002 or so [inaudible], about 2002 sometime, I started to write, sitting down and writing things up on the computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">And it’s been -- it’s been growing ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1525">QUESTION:  Has it been hard to do, to write about these things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1526">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">It’s ver -- ver -- th -- the main -- as I said, the main -- main hardship is not recounting all the experience, but realizing what terrible risks we took. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">We were so inexperienced in the -- in the fighting stage, in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">We learned pretty fast, I suppose, but we -- we did things that were crazy, that -- that we would never have done if we had been more experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">That -- that part of it gave me nightmares, re-realizing how -- what -- what wrong steps we took.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1531">QUESTION:  Although it seems amazing to me that you have such detailed and vivid recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">Have you always had that memory all along of -- of all these incidents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1533">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I don’t -- don’t think so, but I mean, these were very special experiences I have written up, and th-they -- you know, I recall them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">If I was to recall all the experience I’ve had in my professional life, I don’t think it would be quite that experience, but I’ve had a very, very adventurous career in my professional life, too, and maybe if I sit down -- would -- would have sat down a year or two ago, and shud -- conjured up some of those experience again, 1t would have been -- would -- they would have come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">But you know, you start concentrating, and as you know, of course, these were very unique experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And so the -- Peter Maas’s book has been quite an ex -- quite a motivation for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1537">QUESTION:  Are there certain sounds or smells that take you back to that time period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1538">ANSWER:  Mm, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">I -- I -- personally I don’t have a very good smell -- sense of smell any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">No, I don’t -- I don’t think that there -- that any of that nature would -- would take me back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1541">QUESTION:  And when did you write about your journey to -- to find your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">That was at a different time, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1543">ANSWER:  To find my parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">When I wrote up the story? </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">The night I came back from the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">I wrote this whole story 1n one night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1547">QUESTION:  And why -- why did you feel so motivated to do it right away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1548">ANSWER:  Because I wanted to inform all my friends of what I had -- what I had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">I didn’t think that was a historical document. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">Luckily, the guy who typed it up, who was in -- with my -- who had also been in the unit already on D-Day, he said this is a historical document, I want to keep a copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">So I wrote it up, and it took him about four or five days before he finished the typing of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">And I don’t know that I’ve given you one of the originals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">I -- I can ge -- probably get a copy of one of the originals, the way it was originally typed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">It’s -- one of them is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , my cousin deposited it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> on one of their trips, the or -- original type, what this guy did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">Of course, has mistakes in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">This one you have in there 1s -- which was done on a computer by my secretary is -- 1s more correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1557">QUESTION:  And finally, do you feel that there have been things 1n your life, decisions, or the way that you’ve approached things in your life that come directly from, you know, the experiences, what you went through during the war, what also, in general, the Holocaust, you know, that experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1558">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, it’s hard for -- it’s hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the matter is that I’ve had a few -- if -- if -- as I’ve done, if you put a large chemical plant on <span class="DLF">line</span> , with a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is more telling than almost anything I’d done in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">As I said in one of the comparison, on the night of the fifth or sixth of June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , 1944, in the night of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a high pressure, or elevated pressure chlorination plant on <span class="DLF">line</span> in -- in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">But it’s very hard for non-technical people to realize what 1s involved in the invention, development, design and start-up -- a commercialization start-up of a chemical process. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">That -- that’s one -- on aspect of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">So there have been very -- a lot of very interesting experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">The highlight of my professional career, I suppose, was my giving a lecture in the <span class="BUILDING">University of Hanoi</span> in 1986, to a totally hostile -- hostile audience, trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when they should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they were totally hostile, not willing to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">I -- as I said, in one <span class="NPIP">state</span> I was in the <span class="BUILDING">University of Hanoi</span> lecturing 13 years before Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphere was still very different then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">But --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I -- Is -- I think I read somewhere that you -- you’ve also been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and have spoken to students there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1567">QUESTION:  And what’s -- what’s that been like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1568">ANSWER:  Regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">Oh that’s a very interesting experience, very worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">In 1988, on the anniversary -- or was it the -- the 50" anniversary of Kristallnacht, they invited us back from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">My two brothers came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with their wives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">Everybody could bring one companion, my wife came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And we -- I made a condition for coming back, we made that we were going to be allowed to lecture in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">And the people were so enthused about what we did, that they kept on inviting us again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">I’ve been there almost every second year, my younger brother, while he was alive, he s -- he died in the meantime, he went there back every year to lecture, and it was a very worthwhile experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">I insisted on not only lecturing on my war experience, and the Holocaust and all that, but also on Judaism, and the basic concepts of Judaism, which went down extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">It’s a great privilege to do that.</span></p>
