<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER:  My name is Saul, S-a-u-l, Sorrin, S-o-r-r-I-n. I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  What month?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  July 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , the Lower East Side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And we moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , up the socio-economic scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , DeWitt Clinton High School, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">City College</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What did you study?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Anything which did not equip me to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And then toward the end of the depression, I got out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And the federal government was then in the process of expanding its operations that were -- Roosevelt was seeing, you know, trouble in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I got a job in the Treasury Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">This is a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I recall that I was in the Procurement Division, that is, they were buying paper and supplies and other materials to be used by the federal government and by the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And it was an important job. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I mean, we kept -- I remember going to the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> even, in about 1942 or something to talk to them about some paper they had ordered, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I did have a sense that I was doing something important, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But I was exempted from the military because I had some physical problem which I've never really gotten through. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It's not life threatening, but it was enough to get me exempted. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And then, you know, when the war was over
QUESTION:  Let me interrupt for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">What did you know about what was going on in Europe in terms of national security?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Not very much, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We knew that the Jews were being mistreated and there were massacres. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">That information reached us through the mass media. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And we knew it was a war for democracy to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And it had this Jewish component, which I felt very strongly about. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- 1t was somebody who worked for a congressman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> who approached me and said, you know, <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> is looking for people to work in their program. </span><span class="sentence" id="28"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> had two programs after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They had a program for refugees, and they had a program for <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> which had suffered at the hands of the Axis. </span><span class="sentence" id="30"> There the country programs were designed to ship goods, needed goods, to strengthen -- to begin the pouring of life blood into the economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was a big program in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Some in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">None in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and, of course, the very big one in the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Which really attracted me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I wanted to go someplace, and I asked for <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And then, one day, I was at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> after I had been accepted -- and it was sort of touch and go, because of my health problems with the military, but I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I was now at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> getting briefed, educated on the whole program. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And somebody from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA headquarters</span> came over to speak to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And he said to me, "Why are you going to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I really didn't have a good reason, you know, except I wanted to see that part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And he said, "You come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Do you speak Yiddish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="43">and I said, "Yes, I do speak Yiddish." </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And he said, “You must go -- our people -- he was Jewish, too -- are in desperate trouble over there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And they were, you know, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And we need Yiddish speaking staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I want you to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I was trained for just about a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We had seminars and all the rest, and I took off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What was the preparation like? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">What was the training like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, they told us structurally what the program was about, who supplied what, and what was the chain of responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the principal responsibility for refugee programs lay with the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And they were very unwilling participants in the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They didn’t want -- "We're not welfare workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And we’re not --” You know, some of the things which were being said. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They had no taste for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Refugees are a terrible pain in the behind in getting in the way of the movement of troops and materiel, and they just distract the military from its principal mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And so now <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was designated to work as the agency of the occupation forces in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , running these camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Staffed UNRRA by international personnel, people -- United Nations agency, therefore, the people were drawn from Western powers, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , the <span class="REGION">Benelux countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We had a Swiss on my team, and Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And so we learned about that chain of command and some of the problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">By the way, they really didn't know too much about the problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">There was a great dissociation between what was happening in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and what these people knew in the <span class="BUILDING">national headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And that’s a constant difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="67"> And then we took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And we -- I remember I went on the Gripsholm. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was put aboard with a group of UNRRA people. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Gripsholm, which had been during the war, an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">exchange ship</span> for diplomats. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It is not the present-day Gripsholm. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There are new Gripsholms. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And this Gripsholm was a real rat trap. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">During the war, it had exchanged diplomatic people, Japanese from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="75">and reverse. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I spent ten seasick days on the Gripsholm. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I think we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And there we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for two or three weeks getting more briefings. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And then came the day they say, "You are off.” </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I was sent by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> on the Orient-Express, but it was not that fabulous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orient-Express</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , I was immediately whisked as the supply officer for UNRRA team, I think it was 560 if I am not mistaken, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Shall I go on? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There was a camp there which had just been established, I think in December of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I arrived about February, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">In the early part of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  1946?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had been established by General McNarney, who was Eisenhower's successor as the SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allies Expeditionary Force) commander or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="91"> And they had evacuated a whole zedlum (ph) silek? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">of settlements of small <span class="BUILDING">bungalows</span> , I think about 250 such <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , which had been sold by the Nazis, built by the Nazis, for German workers, defense industry workers and their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Two or three, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> -- two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> apiece, and downstairs was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was in the 1930s style. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There was no gas in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">For example, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> were fed with, and the heat was created by, use of firewood. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I mean, until we began to stuff the people who were coming in, into these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">More than -- you would say in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , if you had 250 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , you had four or five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That would have been maybe 1200 people, but we had as much as 3,000 at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="101"> And it was beyond its capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">When I arrived, and the Jews who came into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were infiltrees (infiltrators?). </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They were not, by and large, survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It is estimated, I have read estimates, figures -- accurate figures are very, very difficult to come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There was so much disorganization. -- </span><span class="sentence" id="106">that there were no more than 35,000 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish concentration camp</span> survivors in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And most, many of the survivors that we got were Dachau survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The Germans had tried to destroy -- there was a plan to march all of the haftling, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> to a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , a big <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , down south near the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> , which, I understand, had been prepared with explosives. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And to march them into this <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and then blow the whole thing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But the 3rd Army was approaching and at a certain critical moment, the Germans decided they weren't going to risk the arrival of the Americans, and they simply dropped the whole project. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Left the Jews where they were standing and took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> had also what 1s described as “aussencommandos” that is, branches of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> where Jews were sent in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in what’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberbayern</span> , that is <span class="REGION">Southern Bavaria</span> , to work as farmers on <span class="DLF">farmland</span> under the supervision of the owners. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Or in some cases, in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , or some cases, directly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But, so we had a lot of Jews scattered over the landscape between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mittenwalde</span> , which is a famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">violin town</span> , had Jews working there in various jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And they suffered, you know, they were not fed well. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They were beaten, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But it was not an <span class="BUILDING">extermination center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So, those people came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , a lot of them, and many of them, stayed in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we would reach out to them from our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Anyway, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was just recently set up, and most of the people who were infiltrees who came in from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Jews who may have, who were mostly in the Soviet Union during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="124"> And I think Jewish agencies, important Jewish agencies, like the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee) and HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), and the Jewish Agency for Palestine became voluntary agencies under the supervision of UNRRA, who were to assign some of their people, welfare workers and others to our teams, to help the international personnel administer the camp and to provide services.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Were there non-Jews when you arrived in these <span class="REGION">areas</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  In your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There were a tremendous number of Polish nationals, Ukrainian nationals, Balts, and other, Yugoslavs. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And their <span class="NPIP">place</span> , origins in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> are in a shadow. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Nobody is quite sure what they came from, but we suspect that many of them came voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Many of the Ukrainians, for example, had fought in Vlasov's army, that is a Ukrainian army which had deserted <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Angren</span> and totally deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The Russians threw off the uniforms and fought in SS uniforms against the Soviet Union, against Soviet military. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But a lot of war criminals, we suspect, people who had some culpability, who were involved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> , who came, and many who were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Many who were simple farm workers or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">There were many Russian -- former Russian POWs in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And they had suffered, also, very badly at the hands of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I attended a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> trial of SS who were accused of exterminating literally thousands of Russian prisoners of war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Well, anyway, they all came. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We're faced with the problem of integrating these people into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> setting up a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That was a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We had emptied all these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The Germans had taken everything they could carry, I think, in the <span class="DLF">line</span> of bedding and other personal supplies, but they had to leave their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They were taken out, I think, in 24 hours in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So it was a tough time for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And we had a staff, we had to find people among the Jews to staff the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There were some school-age children brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We had to find doctors, nurses, cooks, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , office people, who would distribute food and clothing, blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we had to assign, we had to create a system of assigning a lot of people to <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150"> And nobody was satisfied because it was so packed and so jammed. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We had really violated health standards and all of the rest to get them in, but the situation was desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and people starving, very hungry, but we got them all in. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We staffed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We had very devoted international personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We had a number of women who worked as welfare workers, Jewish women. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We had a big problem with Jewish women because they became so emotional - So emotionally involved with the problems in their interviews with Jews, what had happened to them, and where had they been, and what had happened, what they had seen -- that we were rotating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Sometimes people couldn't stay more than a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was a very, very difficult time emotionally for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Were there men who were coming in doing the same thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Yeah, we had men, also, but I remember that the welfare workers were women. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I told you, I recall one was Rose Wasserman, a wonderful lady who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And she was with, I think, it’s <span class="BUILDING">Cuyahoga County Courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">She was the chief welfare officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And she did a wonderful job with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then we had to provide food. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Now food, under an agreement made with the military, was a responsibility of the Germans to provide food, and also to provide money, marks, to pay workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We had salaried workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The problem with the marks was that they were worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I think, from a nominal value, I think of four to the dollar before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">A few years later, they were selling for 400 a dollar, and they went up to 4000 a dollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They were really worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But 1t was important to get them on the worker's list because you did get better -- more calories. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We had a specific, specified calorie count that we fed the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And so you got more calories. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And then there were some other privileges for people who were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We had a limited number of jobs, you know, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Frermann</span> , with about 2,500 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We maybe had 200 or 300, maybe 400 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There were people who would load wood for firewood, cooks, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> of various sorts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Who got most of the jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The people who applied for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">There were many Jews who didn't want to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Also, I’m talking about -- were men primarily given the jobs? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Older men, younger men —
ANSWER:  Yeah no, yeah, well, the jobs went based on the gender attached to the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That 1s, a Arankenschwester was a kranken nurse, you know, was a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We had some nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">You know, you'd never see a man who was a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="188"> All of the doctors were men, the dentists were men, one or two exceptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And the women were clerks. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They helped people fill out their DP documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I will talk about those in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And there were people who did various clerical tasks, and that was where women could produce, could contribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We also had a relegazerampt we called it, a <span class="BUILDING">religious office</span> , and some of these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were reserved for <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They're small <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and so we had <span class="BUILDING">Rusisha shul</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Russian shul</span> , and a <span class="BUILDING">Poylissha shul</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Polish synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There were two or three, four maybe different branches, and they were separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And people knew where they wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We had to find rabbis, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I had an American assistant who went around looking for people with beards, and they were designated rabbis. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">These Jews, by the way, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hasidic Jewish community</span> , and we had some that came, were clearly identifiable. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We wondered, you know, how they’d made it through the war, but they were in the Soviet Union during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And then we began the distribution of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We set up <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Now, these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> so that people could cook, take their food and cook as they pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchen</span> where we had people come who were single, who had no family, to eat their three meals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We had to supply the military with a Table of Organization for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for the purpose of salaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We had to justify all the salaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And the religious ampt I remember, gave us a problem because they needed people to erect an eruv -- this wire around, you know about it, around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> during the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I remember this colonel saying, "What is that? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">What kind of <span class="DLF">wire</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">What are you talking about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Ultimately, when we built a mikvah in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I remember I had to explain the meaning of a mikvah and why they had people who did certain personal -- I am not sure what happens in a mikvah, but they rendered personal service, clipping toenails. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Someone was kidding me, he said, takes lint out of the navels, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They were all paid for. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And, then, we had some special food habits, you know, for the Hassidim needed kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And we had a real problem with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="217"> I don't remember how we solved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I think we went to a butcher, a German place where meat was slaughtered, and we had a -- what do you call the guy who does the slaughtering? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I am forgetting my Yiddish, you know -- who slaughters the animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And he was a hasid. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And the meat was taken, carefully handled. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Milk for lactating mothers, those women who were pregnant, the cows had to be milked under supervision by a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They assigned somebody to go and sit in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> with the -- we had to provide transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It was a very complex thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We had a lot of illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They were taken out, weaned out, and we sent them to - we had a <span class="BUILDING">tuberculosis center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Reichenhall</span> , nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We had medical examinations. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">There was a big problem with bad teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Now, we issued DP cards, identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So they had an identity card from the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> with a thumb print, no pictures, a finger print. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">There was also a DP card kept in our files. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Now these people arrived mostly after December and when they arrived, they were not aware that the Truman Directive, signed in early December, I think, which allocated a large number of visa numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The military was very wary about infiltrees, about the increasing number of people coming from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And the British also understood that the larger the number of Jewish displaced persons in the <span class="REGION">American zones</span> , that the greater the pressure would be on them in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and in other forums to relinquish the mandate in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or part of the mandate for the Jews, or to admit more Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Something they did not wish to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So the Americans, who didn't want DPs generally, General Patton was in command in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , and he was not terribly sympathetic to the Jews, tried to shut them off from coming by, declaring that in order to emigrate from the American zones of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you had to show that you had arrived in the <span class="REGION">zone</span> prior to December 22, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And so, these people who came in January, they were not aware of this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And they gave accurately that they had arrived in January or early February and that their place of birth was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , a place not favored by the realities of the quota system, the national origins quota system. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">They would have to sit in Europe for years before they got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But they were being truthful, and they said who they were and when they came and all of the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Later on, they found to their unhappiness, that disqualified them. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They said, "Had I known, I would have told them I came here earlier." </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We thought about it, by the way I’ve used the metaphor, you know, it was December 22 which they made the cutoff date, that on the 25th where Christmas was celebrated, there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> , for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And anyway, we got them all into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we created our own health programs, under the supervision of international medical people, and our own feeding programs, our own <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Right away, the Jews were energetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They set up everything they needed, cultural programs, newspapers began to sprout. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Now, prior to that time, there was a question early on at the end of the war, how would these people be housed, the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They were, after all, multi-national — Poles and Ukrainians and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And a Jew was nominally -- most of them were nominally Polish, Polish nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And so therefore, they would take a whole bunch of Poles, Polish speaking people, and put them, try to put them into one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> into one <span class="REGION">area</span> , under one administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But, you know, the Jews did not consider themselves Polish anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They would not opt in a legal sense, for that identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And so, they -- I am not quite sure how it happened -- but they all declared themselves, I think maybe for immigration purposes, as staatenlos that is, stateless, or as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Now, there was a great deal of jockeying around over how the Jews would be housed, whether they would be housed among the people, as I say, of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in which they were born, which they didn't want. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">American-Jewish leaders were also, I think, playing a role in that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And they wanted all of the Jews together, which was a wise thing to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And ultimately, the military gave in. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">For them, you know, looking directly at it, or for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> looking directly at it, these were Poles or Latvians or Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="260"> But, no, they did not consider themselves that. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And so they all became of one national group. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And in all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in which Jews lived after the war, they lived together, surrounded by a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , whose <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> was often patrolled by Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We organized the police force. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We had a police force in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> alone of over 100 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They were not armed police, but they were Jews who wore armbands declaring that they were policemen, and they patrolled the perimeters of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Conditions were so bad in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">At this time, I was the supply officer for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann camp</span> and all of the small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> I mentioned before, which had sprung loose from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And also for all “free living” Jews in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">In effect, I became ultimately sort of the mayor of the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And they would come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They were Polish Jews, mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">There were very few German Jews remaining in -- just a very few that I ran across, who would come to us for food, identity papers certifying that they were stateless, or that they had been persecutees, and therefore, entitled to certain privileges as to immigration, food, medical care, clothing, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And as I say, conditions were so bad that in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> was hearing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There was a lot of anguish, a lot of anger, and so Eisenhower was sent by Truman to Europe to investigate. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">There had been a report by the Harrison Committee which had stressed some of these inadequacies, but Eisenhower went over to look, he said, for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And what happened was, a week before he arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , the director of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Anyway, and so I was called by <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> saying would I make myself ready to receive the General and to brief him on whatever questions he wanted to be raised. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And sure enough, two or three days before the arrival of the General, all of the security people, military security people, came and checked the whole <span class="DLF">road</span> running down to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> out to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">For security purposes, they emptied <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with <span class="DLF">windows</span> overlooking the <span class="DLF">road</span> , the whole business. </span><span class="sentence" id="282"> I was very impressed, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And on that day, we were laid on and out came the General, riding 1n -- it had to be either Goering or Hitler's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And he was accompanied, of course, by six or eight general officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">You were going to ask something? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">McNarney was among them, Huebner. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I remember those names. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And they came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they spent -- I greeted them as he stepped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He spent about three or four hours, I guess, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And we talked about supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He went and looked at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We talked about <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> ; he went and looked at the <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He talked to the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">A great big sign had been hung by the Jews over the entry to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , "Welcome General Eisenhower." </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I was impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">He’s a very stern-looking guy, very impressive you know, with all of those stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And some of his staff took notes on what I was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And I think it had an impact, my own contribution to that, because within a matter of maybe a month, things began to improve. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We were getting things that we were not getting before. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Of course, the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> had played its role, but Eisenhower coming over there was the basis for making whatever changes were necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  How honestly could you talk to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I mean, here you are, a 25-year-old young man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Well, I could talk pretty honestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I just told him, “General, the situation's tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We have people, you know, stuffed into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> together in such numbers -- the people are sick, their ability to resist disease 1s down. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And so, we are going to have typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We are going to have this, and we’re going to have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They are not getting adequate food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And he listened carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I remember, though, some funny scenes. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We took him into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And the guy who was the director of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a fellow who then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">His name was Spector. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Mr. Spector was a teacher, and both he and his wife were dedicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He and his wife were wonderfully dedicated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They set up the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with teachers, and the children, they got paper and they got pencils. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I told you “IMCA” YMCA supplied us with writing pads for the Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he had coached the children to sing ““The Star Spangled Banner’, in just learning the <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They didn't know what they were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And Eisenhower stood there, you know, his hat under his arm, and he listened as they sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And when it was finished, I was stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I didn't tell Spector until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He said to me, "What are they singing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="325">He didn't recognize it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I wouldn't spoil what these children had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">There was also some confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">He walked into a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I remember, and he took his hat off, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And McNarney leaned over him and says, "General, put your hat on. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">You're in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It was a pleasant visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">The Jews were extremely welcoming to him, applauded. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He was the great hero who had liberated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And it was a wonderful day. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He is a stern-looking guy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">He has his dignity, very little joking around with him, my impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I wouldn't want to cross him, based on what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Anyway, the visit went well. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And as a result, as a matter of fact, in about a couple of weeks, I was notified that I had been appointed director to replace the departed director. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And, that situation went on for, I think, until 1947 when we learned that UNRRA was going to be terminated, go out of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And that it was to be replaced by an agency known as the PCIRO, Preparatory Committee or Commission for the International Refugee Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And that a new modus operandi was to take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">That is, many of the international personnel on our team were to be terminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And their responsibilities were to be turned over to indigenous staff-people, essentially, the Jews themselves, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And there would be no camp director for a given <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> he would be replaced by a camp chairman. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And he had a sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> with him for food, and welfare and housing and security and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And that the Jews were to pick their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And they did so with elections in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And it was marvelously organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  Can we not get to 1947 first, can we stay ...
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  What happened to you when you became director? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">You became director of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> 
ANSWER:  Of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and --
QUESTION:  -- and the subsidiaries?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  -- the subsidiaries and the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">That is, I was responsible for meeting their needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  How many people, then, are you responsible for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  I think at that point it got to be about 3,000, 3,500, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="357"> And what I would do is move around through the various installations under my supervision and meet with their chairman and find out what their problems were. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Maybe once a week, I would be in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , drive around. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I would drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , go around and meet with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in the Zedlum, (ph) in the Neu Freimann. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I supervised all of the programs and saw how they went and people reported to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And I reported to my superiors. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Life was very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">People were trying to get out, and they soon found that the national origins quota defeated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">There was illegal immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And by the way, I recall now that I had very good part of the people on the Exodus who came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann camp</span> and from nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You know, the Exodus was caught and returned to Ger -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> and the Jews were forced off, you know, by British, I think it was British soldiers, with the water hoses. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I got, and I lost -- a lot of things happened to me -- a little book written by children who had been on the Exodus and describing their experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And they dedicated it to me, to undzer khaver director. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I don't know what happened to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">There are things I have lost I regret so. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And we had to receive other people all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">There was constant tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had been closed to infiltrees, and we were taking them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">One of the ways we were able to take them in was when a group of people went illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , their DP cards were left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">When you leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you are supposed to turn them in or to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They were turned over to the camp committee, who used them for the purpose of supplying other infiltrees coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">The UNRRA people told me that apparently we have a very low death rate in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because the population remained fairly static. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Actually, they were leaving, but they were being exchanged with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And then other ways had to be found to avoid the restrictive immigration policies of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and also of the Canadians. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And the documentation, which was on file in our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , on each of the Jews, prevented them if they had to get their DP records to present to the consul generals. (’?) </span><span class="sentence" id="383"> They would reveal that they had arrived in the <span class="REGION">zone</span> after December ‘45, or that they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and therefore they had to wait for a long time for their quota numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Some people had a lot of scars on their lungs, lesions which were healed, but it was not known exactly when the tuberculosis had been active, and they were prevented. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So, if you presented an accurate x-ray, you could be out of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It was a desperate struggle because everything militated against them -- people who had suffered so. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I remember this was said to me, very often, I am going to say it in Yiddish, “Mir haben gemeynt az zey velen uns trogen oyf de pletzes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We thought that when we got out that we would be carried around on the shoulders of the Allies, of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that we would be heroes for having made it through this terrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Instead, they’re finding all kinds of ways to keep us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It was a terrible disillusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And while there was a division in the Jewish community of survivors about where they would go, some said they would go nowhere but to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And of course, they knew what was in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">It was illegal, first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">If you managed to get in, you would be housed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> on some mud flat someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">No jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It was a terrible scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Nevertheless, they wished to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But others wished to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">They had family in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">People who would make <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for them and had jobs for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And they saw their future there. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So there was a constant tension within the DP, Jewish DP community on that score. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They tried to invest the Jews with the kind of Zionist patriotism, but they were all patriotic about the establishment of the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But many of them wished to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">A commission was sent over by the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And they came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to talk to Jews about where they wished to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">The committee was made up of five diplomats, one of whom was from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> before it was divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I am trying to remember which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> became a Muslim country, maybe <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And he was very hostile. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And he tried to probe, you know, "Where do wish to go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And they picked some people at random from in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to come before them. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">There was a big audience in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> listening to this procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And I was the interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And the first guy they picked to be examined was the brother of a business associate of my own father, who asked me to get him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">He had arrived with his wife and two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">They had been in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> , and he was desperate to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417"> I didn't know what would happen, but they took care of it themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">That is, the guy asked, after checking his personal history, said to him, "Now, where do you wish to go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And he proudly spoke up, “Vu alle yiddin forn” he said "Where all Jews wish to go, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eretz Yisrael</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And a great cheer broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Now, he left a week later for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so there was a solidarity in support of the claim of Jews for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eretz Yisrael</span> , and for the right of Jews to be allowed to emigrate there. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">There was 100 percent solidarity, but a lot of people had made decisions about their lives, about where they wished to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But --
QUESTION:  Was there pressure on these people to not go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , not only to not say it --
ANSWER:  Well, there was some pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Yeah, the Jewish Agency was working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and they did a valuable job. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And the whole leadership of the Jewish community was Zionist in its orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So that when, for example, camp administrations were made up, as I’ve indicated, they were elected on Zionist lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Liste eyns, or tsvey — list one, two. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And on that basis, these represented various Zionist political parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">There was a strong, and I think the Jewish Agency and the leaders, Ben Gurion and the rest understood, the value of the DP, Jewish DP community and the experience which the Jews had had -- if you want to call it a value. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But they understood the meaning of it, for bringing pressure against the British and the United States to partition <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or to create a Jewish entity, and to allow the Jews to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And for the United Nations, by the way, ultimately when they did go legally, the UN paid all fares for transportation costs for Jewish refugees travelling to whatever <span class="NPIP">destination</span> they were going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So there was a unity within the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And they would never allow it to be understood outside of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There was a unity that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or the Jewish state would have to be created. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It would have to be supported. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And those Jews, and there were many who wished to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else, would be permitted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="437"> And there were efforts made. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You know there was by the way, also a mobilization effort on the part of the Zionist community, that is, to mobilize Jews, young men and women to serve in the Haganah. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They were trained in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They would be marching around and training with broomsticks as bayonets, rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So they were preparing themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But as I say, you had this tension in the community which 1s, I think, something which happens today, again, you have in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> some of the same things, that 1s, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> accuses HIAS, Jewish agencies, of talking Jews into not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , which is absolutely untrue. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Jews know where they wish to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And my own feeling is they should go where they wish to go, where they will be happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So we had that immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Then we had the illegal immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I was, I think, the only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> director I know of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">There was one or two before me in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but they had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So a lot of efforts by the Jewish Agency or by the JDC centered on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They knew they could come to me and they could speak frankly, and that I was part of the whole apparatus. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So I remember supplying blankets and gasoline and other things, illegally- to people on the move illegally, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Mostly I knew about <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> for immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I think the Exodus people took that route, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And I was asked by them, by the Sochnut or by the Brichah to accompany a transport of, I don't remember, maybe 500 Jews who had been gathered up to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> and to board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> there, and to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And so I sat there in the uniform in the lead <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I had some phony document saying that these people are authorized to travel, in transit, through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> on their way, I think, to <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> , one of those <span class="REGION">South American countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I carried a group visa with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It was done also on onion skin paper, which had names listed and birth dates and they absolutely did not conform to the birth dates or to the people in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459"> And we drove through the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> , me in the front, and we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muehlhausen</span> , that’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And we presented this transit visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Well, first of all, the visa from the Uruguayans or one of those Latin American -- they were all fraudulent, provided by some consul, vice consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And he had been paid something to do that, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And we presented the visas and the transit letter to the French gendarmes at the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">In the meantime, two of these guys working from Palestine Brichah, I could see them going around the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span> , with two big cartons, and I knew there were cigarettes in those cartons. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">The French, also, were badly in need of cigarettes, and deposited it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And then, we were saluted through, and we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span> , and we went to the <span class="DLF">town square</span> , and by God, I was stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">There was the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span> , all dressed up with his red sash across his chest, and women, volunteers, greeted us and provided hot coffee, cocoa or something, and some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Some other food for the people to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We were treated to a speech by the mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Wishing us, wishing our people, a good life in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It was a very nice ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I got back in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , drove back over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">It's a very -- I did that twice, but only once did the Muehlhausen mayor come out for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  Did you have any hesitancy doing this? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">You were after all.....
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I - I did have -- first of all, I am trying to remember whether there were some restrictions on my movement into the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I was crossing a <span class="DLF">zone line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">But I remember that if — if -- somebody had picked this up, they would ask me where did they get the gasoline and the blankets which were military. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were military. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">UNRRA trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They had it on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So there was a risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They were my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> in my <span class="DLF">motor pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Yes, there was a risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I could have- | don't know what would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I imagine, based on some other things I have seen over there, they would have cut me. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I would have been dismissed from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , and they would have sent me immediately <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I don't know whether there would have been any criminal charges, because the military is very leery about getting themselves involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It's a public relations problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So, it would have been tough on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I would have been shipped back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and in some disgrace, not with Jews, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So there was some risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But it's one of my fondest memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="494"> Q: What made you do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  Well, I was Jewish, and my sense of solidarity with my people, with the people, you know, around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I was profoundly sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Then, well, there was also the question of how do you get around the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Now, Jews would apply for immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and when they would come in there, with their documentation, there was a consul general in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , with their DP cards and their records. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It would show they had arrived after December 22nd of '45, and they were automatically eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I am a little unclear about the immigration laws at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Eventually, a new law was passed in '48, I guess, also very controversial, and very stacked against Jewish DPs and the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But it still remained that they had to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">zone</span> before December 22, 1945 in order to be eligible. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So what would happen was, Jews would come in and say, in effect, to one of my staff people, “I came here after, and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is no good for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Here I have this paper saying that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="505"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span> were favored, because during the four, five years of the war, Germans were prohibited from emigrating to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or after, as ex-enemy nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And so all of these unused numbers -- and Germans had a very big quota for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under that national origins quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">These numbers -- Germans who could not use these quota numbers had to stay, and the numbers were saved up and they were turned over to the DPs by the Truman Directive to be used. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">All of these used up numbers going back to 1939, or thereabouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So that relieved some of the problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But the point was, they still operated under the national origins quota, very restrictive. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And under the requirement that they be in a <span class="REGION">zone</span> December 22nd of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So what happened was such people, if they came and asked for help -- I am going to be very candid here -- we would take out their documents and tear up the document. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Nobody knew the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="514"> I was in control of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And put a new DP card in the file. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And I remember in one <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , we had a guy who was an expert at aging these documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Of course, they had to be about two or three years old, you know, so if you saw a fresh, the paper was lousy, if you saw a fresh white paper, you knew it was fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So we had them stacked on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiators</span> to age them a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And then they would bring these papers in, and it didn't take long before the consul generals, they are pretty bright people, understood that there was something not kosher about these. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">A lot of people came in, declared they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but had no German accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">You know, they spoke strong Yiddish, and there was some cockamamie story made up to cover that. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And then they were asked finally to find some document that you told somebody, and it was true, 1f you were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and you didn't keep your birth certificate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They would say write away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in which you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And many of them said they were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span> , <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> where it could not be checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Russians were occupying <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And well, first, they would say “Look, I didn't have any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And I have written, here is a copy of a registered letter which I sent to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East German city</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="528">There were all sorts of means to get out, to get around these restrictive laws or regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">The German quota was an important one. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Sometimes they would go up to some small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> someplace, where it was learned there were some birth certificates or birth documents for people who had died already. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And they would get these, maybe having to bribe an official. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But it was a survival struggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And we countenanced it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Some years ago, I met a guy had been the U.S. Ambassador to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> in the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> to make a speech, and I sat next to him at a lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I recognized his name, and when his bio was read, I remembered he was vice consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , way back when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I told him, "I don't know whether you remember me, but I used to come in and plead the case that the people were unjustly denied. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I would come down to see them." </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And he said he remembered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">He said, “I know that you had” -- what he called “a <span class="BUILDING">document factory</span> ” out there, near one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> nearby.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I said, "We probably did." </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I mean, they were good people, but they were operating according to the regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">By the way, when I spoke to him, he was an Assistant Secretary of State, yeah, Assistant Secretary of State. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Very well known man. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I don't recall his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Tape 2  Well, we went through a very difficult year 1946 and to 1947, when <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> decided to go out of business, and be replaced by the IRO (International Refugee Organization). </span><span class="sentence" id="547">At the same time, the decision was made to evacuate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> , and that became one of the most difficult parts of my whole year, my whole stay in this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="548"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> was considered a privileged camp because it was right on the border of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and therefore, easily accessible to Jewish agencies which had to visit, dealing with various problems, a lot with immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We had the USNA, the United Service for New Americans, which, I think, was like a JDC operation, which processed applications. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We did, too, but they did, I think, a lot of the processing of applications to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The HIAS was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">There was the Jewish Agency, JAFP, Jewish Agency for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , with Chaim Hoffman as its director. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And there was an extensive <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I want to speak about the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> because that played a very important role, not only in assuring the Jews a way of sustaining themselves -- not only Jews, but anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I mean, it was open to all. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">The <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> was not a Jewish making, it was a creation of the German merchants who were backed up with merchandise, which they were beginning to produce. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And they could not sell and make anything unless they sold it on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , because the controlled price in German marks, what you would get would be zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I could get four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">opera seats</span> for two cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="559"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Opera seats</span> had a nominal value of, let’s say, 20 marks apiece. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So the black market was really a creation of the economic system. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">That has to be understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And Jews could not live on the 2,000 calories a person, especially what those calories were made of. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They were made of potatoes and starchy haferflocken, which was a German term for a wheat, a cereal of some sort, dried eggs, dried skim milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Jews could not eat dried eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">That stuff used to lie and rot in <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">One day we discovered, by the way, that a couple of tons of dried skim milk had disappeared from one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It didn't bother us a bit -- except we wanted to know what happened to it -- because the Jews did not enjoy, or take, or drink dried skimmed milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But what happened was, about two or three weeks or thereabouts later, we saw wandering around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> Jews carrying a box slung over shoulder shouting "Lody! </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Lody!" </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Lody is ice cream in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They had used this milk to manufacture ice cream pops, or something, and they were selling them on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">That's very funny, the creativity of our folk. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">But, as I say, the packages which came from the JDC, the Jewish relief agencies, were the real waluta, the real currency, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">The cigarettes in them, which sold for, I think, a dollar a package -- I mean, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were 15 cents or something, or maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I mean, $10 a carton, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="577"> Coffee, marmalade, jam, fat in cans, other things which were priceless. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They became the basis upon which many Jews -- they could trade them for meat, for bread, for other things to sustain their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And so going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> became very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">People had access either by the few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> which were running, or by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> which they could hitch a ride on to go and do their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">There was a famous <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I want to mention it, called <span class="DLF">Mohl Strasse</span> , M-o-h-l. I’ve been back there, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I once went back some years later to buy some Meissen Rosenthal china for my mother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But it was a great center of <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> currency dealings. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Jews were carrying currency during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Those who were not in concentrations camps, those who were in hiding, sewed into the linings of their clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They were carrying many things in order to enable themselves to live, if they ever made it through. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And they went to exchange these dollars for various things, whatever, or to trade them up, in some way to change them. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">All currencies into national hard currencies were being traded there. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Not German marks, but Swiss francs and British pounds and American dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And they were subject to raids all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">The military would come pouncing down on them because the military declared its intention to protect the German economy or to rebuild the German economy, and these <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> operations were, they felt, destructive of the economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I think that’s subject to some doubt, but that’s what they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But in any case, when the announcement was made that there would be an evacuation, there were great protests, and it took a long, long time for us to move these people out to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Some attrition, some people went away to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , others emigrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Nevertheless, we were accused of using all of the terminology of the wartime period of deportations, of Aus Zeslac (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="597">or whatever they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Just like, about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , Jews were being forced, against their will, out of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> , as I say, was a favored camp in that setting. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And ultimately, it was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I was then asked to take over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , which was one of the biggest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I think, well, it was designed for about 3,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">There must have been more, I don't recall the figures, 4,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> was actually two or three installations. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">One was about 30 miles south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> toward the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> was situated. </span><span class="sentence" id="606"> There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> itself, which had been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> for German labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And then there was a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geretsried</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which housed about 1,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It became, ultimately, by the way, I believe the first legal exit point for immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when it became legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">People were processed there for health, their teeth, and the rest, for our paperwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And they would move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geretsried</span> , whose name was changed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Negev</span> , because it looked like it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Negev</span> , a really forsaken <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">That’s where a lot of military training took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">We were, by the way, being watched by <span class="DLF">air</span> , by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> by the intelligence people trying to find evidence that military training was going on in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And then there was a <span class="BUILDING">children's center</span> nearby which brought children, picked up in various ways by khappers, grabbers, who went around <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> finding Jewish children that they had heard about. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I am sure that in some cases in their haste to get out, there were some non-Jewish orphans among them, who are now living someplace in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But finally, we closed it down, and we moved all of our operations to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> and to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The great movement of Jews I forgot to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">You know, after the war, through maybe about March of '46, there was movement of Jews, but it was on a small, relatively small scale, infiltration. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But as you know, I don't remember the precise month, maybe May, I think, or thereabouts in 1946, a pogrom took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , where there was a trumped-up charge that Jews were baking the blood of a Polish kid who had disappeared into the matzahs, which were being consumed for Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I think that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Ultimately, the Polish government -- this 1s not known -- punished very severely those people responsible for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">There were 46 Jews killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Right wing anti- Semitic movements in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were accused of having fomented this thing, and there may be something to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> program came like an enormous shock over the whole of the Eastern European community, such as it was at the time after the war, especially in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And then we, in the west, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , mostly in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , experienced a strong wave, I don't know how many thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">They say, I have heard 80,000 or so people came, all of a sudden, into <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which had been declared closed by the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="626"> And we had to accommodate them in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And it was done contrary to regulations and the rest of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And I recetved, I remember, trainloads of people -- no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , we got a lot of these people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> , then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And then there was a constant movement of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I think the next relatively major movement was as a result of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> airlift. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">That was in 1947, I think. (</span><span class="sentence" id="633">Berlin Airlift was June 24, 1948-May 12, 1949). </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We got Jews, they had cleared the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And each time that happened, it was a tremendous amount of effort, how to fit them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We would have to put them in among others and maybe among other families. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">A terrible crisis was precipitated anytime that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I have to speak about this <span class="BUILDING">children's center</span> which we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I remember the man's name was Merrin (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I have a picture of that <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And he wrote me a message on the back of the picture when I left, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It was a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> , an installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I am not sure what it was for before, but we kept kids in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And the Brichah would bring in a load of kids, children maybe six, eight years old, something like that, who had been concealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I don't know where they had been, but they would bring them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And maybe 30 or 40 at a time would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And then, a quarrel broke out within the Jewish community between the Jewish Agency, I guess, and the various elements in the Jewish Agency and the central committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They were all going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , these kids, 1t was decided. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But what was very important, under whose auspices? </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And so a rotating system was set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="651"> This is very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I think I am remembering it carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We agreed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We just wanted to get the kids out. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">They would stay in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , this group, let's say 20 or 30 kids, would stay for a month or six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And during that six weeks, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> would be run by, let us say, the Mapai socialist party, Ben-Gurion’s party, or Mapam, the more leftist. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And they were being taught and trained according to the philosophy of that branch of Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I mean, these kids absorbed it like water. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And we had the right wingers, the ‘revisionistim’ they were called, and they were singing revisionist songs and marching up and down in the military style of the revisionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And that's the way we finally dealt with the problem, just rotating a whole group, a new group of people came in to take over the training of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">They were wonderful-looking children, looking at some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Some of them spoke some Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I remember asking ‘vu forst du?’ "</span><span class="sentence" id="665">Where are you going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And this kid, ‘for ken Eretz Yisrael’ He was from the right wing. “</span><span class="sentence" id="667">/ch for hargenen ale,” ("Tam going there to kill Arabs,”) he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">It was not funny to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I said, "Is that what you’re training these kids to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Anyway, so we had these three installations, and there were others in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waltershausen</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> nearby, had some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And constantly, again, circuit riding. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We also had people who were struck down. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis, and we would send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Reichenhall</span> , where there was a big <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Later on, we even sent people to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , I think, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">There were a number of Jewish survivors recovering from tuberculosis, patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Do you know about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I had a number of people, one of my assistants, I sent a woman, a girl, from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And now I worked under IRO’s auspices in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Subsequently, they asked me also to give some attention to Feldafing. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">It was quite a ride, on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , there was a big installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And I’d come in and meet with the people and talk about their problems, see what could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So that's -- yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  When you went and visited the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , whether it was under UNRRA or, when it was IRO, did you meet with the people who were sort of the camp functionaries?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  Or did you also go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and just meet with the people? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">A: Well, they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">There would be an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that I had in each of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> or a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that I would sit in. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So first, I would meet with the functionaries, that is, the man in charge of food, <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , 1mmigration, various aspects -- health care. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And discuss their problems, shortages, what they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">A guy in charge of education would complain about the absence of school materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Supply questions, and also internal problems, political problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">In the broad sense, political problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Having problems putting people in there, they don't want to go there, and people are making trouble about this or that or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So, I tried to handle all of that, write them down, and see what could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We had limited resources. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I would do whatever I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But then came a time for what we call ‘bittes’, that is, requests or complaints. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I would sit in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">People would line up <span class="NPIP">outside</span> 20 or 30 or40, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">If 1t was a busy time, there would be more, and they were admitted one-by-one. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And I would talk with them about what they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Very frequently, it had to do with immigration, that 1s, “mir hut mir upgesugt’: “I was refused by the consul general" and "What do I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I would offer some advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I can't tell you what I offered, but sometimes I offered, and this was pretty frequently the case, that they tear up their documents, get new documents, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> to the north, where there was a consul general and reapply all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And it worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  What other things did people come, when they came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  Immigration, illness, “Can you find a relative of mine in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I am looking for somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> ,” or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Police, problems of the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Jews frequently ran afoul of the laws, that is, they were caught. “</span><span class="sentence" id="712">My son has been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He was carrying illegal currency or <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , other operation, caught selling cigarettes or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And his trial will be so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And it will destroy us if he 1s convicted. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">He may not be able to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Can you help me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And I spent a lot of my time in the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">summary courts</span> , that is, the <span class="BUILDING">military summary courts</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> where I had cultivated -- because I saw it as my responsibility -- cultivated acquaintances with the judges, who were American military officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">One was my neighbor, lived down the <span class="DLF">street</span> from me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And we would have parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">He would come over, I would go to his <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">It was a very good contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Not that he would simply let people off when I asked, but he would understand better what their cases were, and very frequently gave them a very light sentence or let them off or suspended a sentence, or did whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And that was a very, very significant part of my responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I don't think it would have been the responsibility of another, somebody who was an UNRRA who didn't have the same sort of commitment that I had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  Because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  Yes, because I felt a responsibility to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I grew very expert at explaining all of the problems faced by Jews after the war, what they had experienced during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We had a lot of pathologies, I say, people who were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And we tried in our own primitive ways to deal with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I remember a very extreme case of a man who had survived by eating the flesh of his fellow haftlinger in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , some bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> he had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">This was on his mind, his head -- every once in a while he had a breakdown, ‘Ich hab gegesen’ because I ate, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">He was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">He'd come to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">There was a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">One day Sam Haber, the director of the JDC came on a visit to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And he drove up 1n a nice-looking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">station wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">They have jeep-looking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">station wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And on the side it was written, American Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And we were talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Whenever I met him here in the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> , he would remind me: I saw a man who had been in a <span class="BUILDING">katzet</span> someplace come up behind him. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">The guy held up a lead pipe, and was going to smash Haber over the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I jumped in front of the guy and grabbed his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He was shouting, ‘ganovim’, calling everybody thieves. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">They are stealing. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">My family is sending me from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I mean, we had really an impossible situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  What did you do with people who were really out of control?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  We tried to hospitalize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  In <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric hospitals</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Yeah, wherever we could find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">They were in short supply. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">At the very end, as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> began in 1950 to draw down and to a close, we were left with a group of people who were described as hard core, who would not move. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Many of them would not, and some who could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Many of these people were people with that kind of a problem, mental illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And the Israelis were not too anxious to receive them. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">They had enough problems of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And so these people remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I was shocked to learn from somebody somewhere that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , which I left in 1950 and I thought was well on its way to being closed, didn't close until 1957. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">The Germans were running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the later years. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Of course, there was a JDC in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , too, with some help. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">But these people were people, as I say, with criminal records, with pathology of various sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It was a tragic sort of thing -- the refuse of our people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">But they fought us tooth and nail about the evacuation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , premature evacuation, which meant that they could have been thrown onto the German economy, fend for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And that’s something they didn't want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Our people were shielded from the German economy, that is, German police, the German criminal justice system did not apply to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">They went to Jewish-run hospitals or <span class="BUILDING">United Nations hospitals</span> of various sorts, and they were cared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But ultimately, I remember walking in on people and saying ‘far vos fohrt du nisht avec’. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We tried to convince them to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It was not as great a problem as the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And they felt guilt about sitting there. “</span><span class="sentence" id="772">Mir zizten oyf undser primadanas,” (“We are sitting on our suitcases here.’’) </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I said, "Don't sit on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Pick them up and und fohrt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eretz Yisrael</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="775"> The rabbis who worked for the JDC were enlisted in this effort of trying to talk Jews into going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">It was inconceivable, I think, to many of them, and to me, that Jews would remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">That some would even make a life there, and as a matter of fact, many did. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">There were people -- I have gone back on a number of occasions to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and have met and talked with, and have been entertained by Jews, Jewish businessmen, professionals, doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I think I told you that the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Munich krankenhaus</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , was a survivor I knew very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And by the way, he became ultimately the president of the Jewish communities of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neider Oberbayern</span> , that is, <span class="REGION">Southern Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They had a confederation of small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And he became the president of that organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So that’s the way it was ultimately settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I don't know whether any of the people are anywhere under UN care still, but I sort of doubt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But it leaves a long and laborious problem where we were faced with all kinds of demonstrations and small riots and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">People didn't want to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  Let's go back over some of the details -- the legal situation, the problems that people would get into trouble with the law or violate something. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Can you tell us about the situation with the stolen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- not stolen, but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that was bought, on the — accident, and what you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  There was a tendency -- I want to say as background, in the very beginning, when the Americans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they thought in the American way that all of the people living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would be subject to German police and the <span class="BUILDING">German courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790"> And if a DP was arrested for smuggling cigarettes or beating somebody, whatever, that he would be put into a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">German jail</span> , and arrested by the German police, and tried under German law. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Well, it was an abuse of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">There were a lot of hard feelings, as you can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And there was violence, and German police did some things which were vicious, and protests were raised by various people, including the American Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And then a decision was taken, it was a very important decision, that no Jew could be arrested by German police. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">They had no power over Jews, except they could detain them until military police came by and got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And if Jews were sentenced to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , they were sentenced to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in stockades, a military term for <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , where American soldiers were sentenced for various offenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">They did their time in stockades, and when they were tried, they were tried in a <span class="BUILDING">military court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We had two or three levels, it was a summary court. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I mean, depending on the seriousness of the offense. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And there would be a military prosecutor and a military judge sitting in judgment on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And this protected them, insulated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">This was for criminal acts, of course, smuggling mostly, <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , whatever, but also occasionally, for some more serious offenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">But mostly, it was sort of a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I was constantly running down their pleas. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">You know, Joe or John, whatever the judge's name was, please think about this guy, what he had been through, and all of the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">It very frequently worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But then there were offenses of Jews, one Jew against another Jew, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Thefts took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Fights took place over such thing as <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> or some deal which they had made with each other and didn't work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And there was an embarrassment, I think that's the best word I can think of, for the goyim, for the non-Jews, that these things were happening, that after the war, Jews were beating each other up or doing things to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And so these things we tried to settle internally in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And a kind of primitive justice system was set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And for want of a better one, I remember, I served for about a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> , I think, yeah, as a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I would hold <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as a guy sitting there, listening to the evidence, and deciding whether to dismiss the case or get together and settle the thing, or whether there was some penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I had no <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816"> I had no way of doing that, but the penalty was deprivation of some privilege or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But at least there would be a statement, a verdict, some finding. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And we also had a problem, I think I mentioned this, occasionally when a kapo would be found, or a ghettopolizei who was accused of cooperating with the Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , resulting in the suffering of Jews maybe the death of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">After we pried him loose from an angry mob, all bloodied and I tell you, terrible, we would try to listen to what this man had to say for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And he would try to produce witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Of course, there were accusers, people who found them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and came and told how he extracted money from them in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> somewhere, and then sent their son off for deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">But so often, we would find that where a group of people told stories on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , another group of people who knew him from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> would line up and say he was wonderful. “</span><span class="sentence" id="823">He saved my life” or “He saved my father.” </span><span class="sentence" id="824">It was a very, very difficult <span class="REGION">area</span> to try to be a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And, I was not trained to be a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I just used whatever common sense I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">People seemed to be satisfied with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Now, what did we do with those Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We had no way of dealing with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">We were embarrassed to turn them over on a war crimes charge, can you imagine, to an American judge or American prosecutor who would have been unheard () of Jews, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And I am trying to remember -- I am not clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">What we would sometimes do, we would call in the people who were from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brichah</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And they were young, strong guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I don't know what they did with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">We would give them to take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">They must have questioned him, in the <span class="BUILDING">Sochnut offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And some people told me they were drugged and taken away on illegal transports to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> where they were again tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And if there were really serious offenses, I don't know what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Shame played a big role in the punishment, that his name would be published in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He is a man who, in this and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> or whatever, did the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And so he would be sort of a marked man in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I think, my recollection 1s that this played a powerful part - people didn't want that attached to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">It was almost as bad as, maybe, as a jail sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So that’s the way these things were resolved. </span><span class="sentence" id="845"> Then there was the civil justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">There were questions of civil justice, where agreements had been breached, mainly in the area of <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , where a load of cigarettes or coffee or something had been paid for, and on the way to delivery, were stopped by military police and confiscated, the whole load, including the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And the driver was thrown into <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So now the guy who supplied these cigarettes, for example, came to the guy he sold them to and said, “Give me my money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="849">In the case where there was no prior payment, the guy had to get some money out of it or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Then there would be an argument about who was responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">In that case, these things were submitted to a deen torah, that is, a <span class="BUILDING">rabbinic court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And we had a rabbi, a number of rabbis in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but there were a number of rabbis around who would hold <span class="BUILDING">court</span> on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And there was agreement that the verdicts they reached would be obeyed, would be complied with. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">So generally, that was the sort of justice system. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We tried to avoid, and I tried to avoid, any reference to any access to the general criminal justice system which, for Jews, was by and large was the military authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  You told me about a situation in which a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was bought, and 1n an accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Well, we had our attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Speaking of "ours," I mean Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> immediately after the war, knowing of the unbelievable horror under which these people had suffered, we had the same hatred towards Germans that the Jewish DPs had. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Not quite the same, but it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And very often, it skewed our sense of equity. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So one night, I was asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It was about midnight, and suddenly 1n this graphone (ph), in this big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , somebody's banging at the <span class="DLF">front door</span> downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I heard the girl go down and open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , ask him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">He said, “/kh muz mit dem director sprechen, redn, sprechen,” whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Speaking Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And I came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">There was this guy panting. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I asked him what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">He said he had bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> illegally, and he was riding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> around, and he lost control of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ran up on a <span class="DLF">loading platform</span> for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> , where there were a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">There was massive use of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> at all, hardly any. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And he struck a number of people, but I don't know what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I think he may have killed a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And he said to me — “I don't know whether I killed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Jr muz mir rateven,” he said, “You have to save me!” </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Well, I didn't think very much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Here was a man, probably with a number on his arm or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And I said, “Come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and in the morning, I will take you to one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and we will see that you are placed on a transport bound for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , illegal transport.” </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And we did that the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">About three or four days later, I was told he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Now, whether he was picked up in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> by the British on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I don't know, but he was certainly not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I have thought about that for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Was that a proper exercise of my values? </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I am deeply troubled even to this very day. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">That is, I think we have to avoid situations where Jews, because of the sufferings they experienced, are exempt from the best human standards of mankind. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And what I did to him was, I said to him, ““You’re exempt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And I think that was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I have lived with that ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I wouldn't do it in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">But it didn't take me 30 seconds to say come on in. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And when I have discussed it with friends of mine who are survivors, and said ““What would you do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="897">They say, “I would take him in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="898">They would have condemned me had I handed him over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">QUESTION:  Tell me, in these <span class="BUILDING">court</span> situations that you set up, inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , were there ever abuses of children or violence against women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I never heard of any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Or children. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Now, it could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I just want to tell you, Henry Cohen is a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I haven't seen him for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I gave a party for some military people in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And there were some military and UNRRA people. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And here was a guy who I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I looked at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I saw it was Henry Cohen's brother, Sidney Cohen, who was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I don't know where he is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">They were dear friends of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">My mother and their mother would take us all to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">We used to go up. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I said, "My God, what are you doing here, Sidney?" </span><span class="sentence" id="917">He was stationed in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> nearby, and said, “But you know who else is here, Henry is here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I said, ““You’re kidding. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Where is Henry?” </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Well, Henry was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">He was in charge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Henry had been a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And he had taken this job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , and he stayed there for about six months, but he got fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I am telling this on Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">The reason he got fired 1s, he had <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And some Jewish DP had done something wrong, and Henry locked him up in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , sentenced him to, I think, seven days in this little lock-up he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Well, the UNRRA regulations precluded him from locking up people, holding people like that for more than, let’s say, two days, or something, or a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Just long enough, if the guy was dangerous, until somebody could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But he decided he would impose the whole sentence so there would be no recourse to any <span class="BUILDING">military jails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And he held him for seven days. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They came, and it got him into deep dutch, and ultimately, he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">He lives, now, I think, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I used to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">He was an urban planner. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And he eventually became a professor of urban planning at The <span class="BUILDING">New School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coventry</span> , I think, as a volunteer after the war, and helped to redesign the town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coventry</span> , which had been destroyed by the Nazis, including their <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> , the famous <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coventry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">But I remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Well, Henry and I had a wonderful time there together with his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">We were deep, good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And I would drive the 40, 50 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> occasionally to see him and have dinner with him, or he would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Ultimately, when he left, I was given control of his operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">QUESTION:  You described lots of babies being born after -- was there a lot of freedom in terms of sexual relations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, we had a problem with that, because when families came, and we had to house them in public, big <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> , the only <span class="DLF">walls</span> we had for them were blankets strung on strings, on rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And these people were conducting their family relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And you could hear everything going on under the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And I remember, I always have this impression about Bulgarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">There was one Bulgarian couple that arrived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And he was a magician. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">He claimed he was a circus performer. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">They looked a little bit freaky to me, and it was confirmed by their neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They said ,“Chaver director, you’d never believe what is going on there sexually with his wife.” </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I think there was some leather going on, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">They were embarrassed. “‘</span><span class="sentence" id="955">Get them out of here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And I had the welfare worker talk to them, move them someplace where they could be more private. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But you had the shards of the Jewish community in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">In many cases, except whole families who came from the Soviet Union, you had single people drifting, they’d lost their families, lost their wives, lost their husbands, fathers, mothers, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And so there was a tremendous drive to try to recreate the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And so we had a tracing service, and people would apply. </span><span class="sentence" id="961"> Can you find so and so? </span><span class="sentence" id="962">But very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">There was some good, but most of these people were gone, had died in some way, had been killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And so there was a thrust to rebuild families. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And people were getting married in great numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And they were having babies in about a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">We had small <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , and, I think, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freimann</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">But we had to use the <span class="BUILDING">Munich municipal hospitals</span> for the OB-GYN, and people having babies right in that setting. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I used to say to myself, if I ever got married and had children, there was a question after what I had seen whether I would want to be Jewish or not, maybe go through the same kind of -- but they had some faith 1n their futures. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And they didn't know where they were going, and they began to rebuild the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And we had lots of babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">We had to clear, I remember, a <span class="INT_SPACE">clinic floor</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="973"><span class="INT_SPACE">Hospital space</span> was very scarce, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> had been bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So there was the thrust to rebuild your family, to recreate. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I mean, you had people -- a woman who had three kids, and a guy who had four kids -- everybody is gone, just the two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And now, they marry, and they begin the process, building all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">QUESTION:  Was it generally -- did the people got married or --
ANSWER:  They got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Well, we had sex. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">There was a lot of romancing going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">It's best I didn't probe too deeply into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">That was their own business. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">But we knew what was going on, and we knew people wanted privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And we knew they were being married, and we knew they were producing babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">There's a scene, you have a picture showing women in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , sort of a public area, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">There must have had hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I don't know where they got all the baby carriages, but they had them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">QUESTION:  How were people adjusting when the children came? </span><span class="sentence" id="988">It also had to be a trauma in some ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">ANSWER:  They had lived, you know, for five years under these unbelievable circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Some had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Some had lived in hiding or lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And somehow or other, I don't know how they did it, they managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">You know that accounts for the enormous resourcefulness of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the Jews that came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I know hundreds and hundreds of Jewish survivors in various parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> who have come here, and their history is an incredible one. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">They have built themselves up. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">They built businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="997"> They engage themselves in the charitable undertakings of their communities. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I find they are one of the most productive groups of people you could ever find. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Russian Jews are doing a lot of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">In my experience, you see the same sort of impulse, the drive to survive and to prosper and to bring children forth and to see these children succeed -- it’s just incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , if you had to feed your kids, I mean, that was the only way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">It was nonsense to go tell them, “Look, you are destroying the German economy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">That, I would not do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">QUESTION:  But when these babies were born, you did say, it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I would imagine the years of male and female, sometimes quite young, having lost their -- not the older folks ...
ANSWER:  It was very difficult, but we tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">The JDC did a great job in supplying the kinds of things -- diapers, and we got them milk you know, evaporated milk, to feed...
QUESTION:  Did you train the women to know what to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  I think there were some training programs being done by the nurses and the medical people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Lactating mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">We had orthodox people who came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And they had to have -- well, we had to have special milk for all pregnant women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">QUESTION:  Because they couldn't nurse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">ANSWER:  No, I am trying to remember why that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">But there was a big demand for milk for lactating mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">But the orthodox had a special problem, it had to be kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">We would have some farmers that we contracted with who milk cows, fresh milk for these families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And a rabbi, a hasid would sit in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> to observe, look at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> and look at the way the cows were being milked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  Did you notice in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that there -- 1t -- was more male than female in terms of the survivor population that you could tell?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  I could not tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I guess there are some statistics on it, but I don't know what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I have a feeling there were more men than women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">You know, I want to say something else: I wish I had these pictures here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">People came from various directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">You know, you had people who came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And, by God, I had a feeling as I looked at them, that they bore the scars of that experience on their faces, on their bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And then there was another group of people, who were mainly single, who had fought in the Soviet army, or who had been in the partisan underground in the valder, they used to say, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And they comported themselves differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">After a number of years with these people, I knew -- I could tell so many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I was almost -- had become like, I think, I stayed the longest of anybody in working in that <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1029"> For some reason or other, I was drawn to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And you see guys walk with this kind of an attitude, and you knew this was a guy -- there 1s a picture there, and I don't know whether you have a chance to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">They were standing on the hood of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , on the hood and on the fenders of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , dressed in /edermantel, these leather coats which, I think, were taken from Nazis officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And the shtiv/, the boots, taken from Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Many Jews came dressed in Nazi clothing with the buttons removed, you know, all of the decorations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">They simply, in a fight someplace or battle, had taken this clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Clothing was very valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And they are just standing there, saying, “Tn your face”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And that was their attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">They were difficult for me to control, these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They were constantly in fist fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Whereas, I think, there was a kind of a -- I don't want to call it submissive, that’s not what it was -- but these were people who had suffered deeply, who had been gepiniket is the Yiddish term. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">They were pinikt, they were tortured in some way physically and deprived of food, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Living on the brink. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Not knowing, you know, that any day somebody would say “Out”.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">QUESTION:  When you arrived in Europe you didn't really know very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Didn’t know what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  Not a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Well, I knew something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1048">QUESTION:  Did your knowledge through these years come from spending time with these particular survivors, and them telling you the story, or from the reading about the reports from the newspapers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">ANSWER:  Well, they were very anxious to talk to me, that is, survivors, especially <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">This is what was done to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">They had to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">They were anxious to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And the people who were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> would also speak about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I learned a lot from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">But what I have learned has been modified, or enriched, by what I got from my reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">That 1s, I was really dealing with a sort of macro at the very local level where great events were, like when Jews moved by the hundreds of thousands out of the Soviet Union in 1946, as a result of the Mikolajczyk ohpmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Mikolajczyk was the president of the London government of the Poles, who had reached an agreement with the Russians to allow the Polish nationals to leave the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058"> I learned that from somewhere else, or I learned the real truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">That is, these people also had a very limited view of their universe, which was very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And lead to some miscalculations on their part, or misunderstanding, so it's a combination of both. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">But I think the human feelings, the sense of what these people experienced, I seemed to get from my personal encounter with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">QUESTION:  Can you give us some instances of what people told you and what effect that had on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Because it couldn't have been easy, either, to be 1n that situation for so many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">ANSWER:  Well, they told me the horror, what they experienced people, being assassinated before their very eyes, shot down, babies being smashed against <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I mean, it was really unbelievable for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I learned, also, something about the almost accidental way in which things happened to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">That is, they are sitting in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the mother said, “Moishe, go get me a loaf of bread or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">See if you can find something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">He goes out -- I know this happened to somebody I know -- looks for the bread, comes back, and there is nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">In the meantime, while he was gone, just accidentally -- she could have said it to another brother of his -- they were all taken out and deported, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Can you imagine this guy surviving this way? </span><span class="sentence" id="1072"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration camp</span> experiences dealing with kapos, dealing with the violence in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and it wasn't a pretty picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Survival meant, very often, set one Jew against the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">In some cases, stories of some kindness, some act of kindness, even by an SS officer — “Get away from here,” something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Or by other ethnics, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">They hated the Ukrainians and the Balts because they were the principal accessories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">All of the gruesome details. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">They had this man telling me about having to eat somebody's flesh in order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">No food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They just were ready to starve you to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">How they were arrested, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">What happened in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , how the Germans came and suddenly they were -- they reported to the apelplutzs (ph) . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">When they were asked to report, they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And that was their mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">If a cop comes and says “You go down and appear at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> tomorrow morning at 8:00 o'clock,” don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">That was their philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">It was all melding into one big mass remembrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">But there was a tremendous amount of conversation and talk about it, until I had it up to here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">QUESTION:  Did you go away did you go on a small vacations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">ANSWER:  Well, we would go occasionally on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">But the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I could go with some regularity -- we’d get away maybe once every couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">If you look at your map, you could see we were about three or four hours from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , from the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And we’d drive down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Konstanz</span> , which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> on the <span class="DLF">Swiss German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And from there, about another 30 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And there was just an incredible change, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Schlagsaahner, that’s whipped cream and cookies and cakes and chocolate and night clubs and all of the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And you’d spend three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">You thought you were refreshed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And then, you would come back to the grimness of the horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Occasionally, I would accompany a group of Jews who were being, again, treated for tuberculosis in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I remember that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> was the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the site. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Have you heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> , D-a-v-o-s? </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Now I hear about it in ski contests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort city</span> and they hold ski meets there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> was a place with a number of <span class="BUILDING">sanitoriums</span> , and the Jews stayed there to recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And then they were sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">UNRRA paid the bill in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">You have heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Where is that, <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1110"><span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I have to say something about the international organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> -- I mean, all of the processing of Jews, that is, was paid for, the welfare and their migration, their tickets were bought, to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when it was established, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Their medical care in foreign countries when that became vital, when people were thought to be able to be helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So it was a great humanitarian service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115"> I know that many of our people here, <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , think of the Arab states and the refugee problem and there is a negative feeling about the U.N., generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">You know, the U.N. intrudes -- especially on the basis of the U.N. -- the Middle Eastern situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But they can be eternally grateful to the United Nations to UNRRA, for the great service which they rendered to the Jewish people as well as other refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">But the Jews especially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER: None
ANSWER:  Terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I think the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , more than anything else I can think of, generated hostility towards the Jewish community as it then existed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , among the military and among, I think, Germans, generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And the newspaper people would come over from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and want to know about “the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> ” because I think it was publicized here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And we were very sensitive about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was told that a number one priority of the occupation immediately after the end of the war was the reconstruction of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's economy, which was smashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And Eisenhower and the people that came after him, and in particular, John McCloy, General Clay, all made that a number one priority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And therefore, the diversion of goods, of manufactured goods, and food from the regular <span class="BUILDING">market</span> was considered a very great threat to the economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And measures were to be taken against it, police measures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">At the same time, the people who were withholding these goods -- if you walked into a <span class="BUILDING">German shop</span> , <span class="BUILDING">camera store</span> , for example -- until the currency was reformed, that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> lay absolutely empty of any merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">You couldn't buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">You couldn't buy clothing because the clothing had to be sold at regulated prices, and the mark, the reichsmark, which was still the old reich before the d-mark, was practically worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I mean, it went to like 800 to a dollar at one point, so that the Germans would not sell their goods on the open <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">That is, on the regular <span class="BUILDING">market</span> under controlled prices, because they would be losing their shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And it was only to be bought with hard currencies: dollars, or Swiss francs, or British pounds, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Now, for the Jews, the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> was the only place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">These were people who had come out of the most terrible conditions, in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or in hiding, or in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> where there was nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And there was a thrust to rebuild themselves, to rebuild their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">They were producing children, doing all of these things, and the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> became the only way in which they could meet that need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137"> And, also, to produce some income for them, so that when they went overseas to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in which they would settle, they would have a few dollars in their pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And so this <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">It took the form very frequently of little <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , thriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">You could buy most anything you needed or wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Food, cloth for making clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">The joke was, you could get anything you want -- You couldn't get anything you want, but you could get a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And it thrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Now, the military authorities knew about it, and they would launch raids on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to grab these people in the act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And early in the morning, maybe about 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00 o'clock in the morning, they would surround the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armed vehicles</span> , and they would go marching tn there looking for contraband: cigarettes, coffee, all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I remember a funny story about how this stuff got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">There's a big <span class="BUILDING">meat market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">The question is, where do you get meat in a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Now, we discovered the meat was gotten in this way: garbage was collected by German firms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And they didn't use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , they used sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sledges</span> , which were dragged along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , no wheels, just like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleighs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And they were pulled by two oxen; they would come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with two oxen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And then, the same sledge would emerge with one ox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Then for a few days, there would be meat, kosher meat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But in any case, in the event of a raid in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the United Nations had to receive prior notice from the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">No military people could enter a United Nations Displaced <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Persons Camp</span> without prior clearance from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , from the responsible United Nations official. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">So, when any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> over which I had any kind of supervising relationships were about to be raided, I would receive a call from the colonel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> saying, “Mr. Sorrin, tomorrow morning at 7:00 o'clock, we are going to be entering your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And of course, now, 40 or 50 years later, I am free to say it -- I would call up and tell Haim Yankel or the president of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> tomorrow is going to be a razzia, a raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">You know, I could not abide these -- I mean, I was sympathetic with what the Jews were trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I had no participation in it, but I would just tell them, if you don't want to be raided, put your stuff out of sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And that thrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161"> And I understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And the military did not, from their vantage point, nor did the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">They were simply obeying the mandate of the military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">But without that, it would have been tragic for Jewish families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  What happened between Jews, because obviously, some people were more entrepreneurial and others were not so entrepreneurial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Some people made a lot of money, but most people made a little money, enough to get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">But we used to hear that some people made big deals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Now, I want to also mention that very often, involved in these big deals were members of the armed forces themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">That is, some of the P.X. people who had access to cigarettes and coffee from the P.X.

ANSWER:  Now, this is an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">street</span> , I don't remember its name, on which Jewish DPs lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">They had built small -- in Yiddish it’s called geveldelach, little <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> , little <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> , one after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">On these <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> , you could buy almost anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Fruit, oranges, apples, meat, bread, booze, and cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Whatever you needed, for to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And it thrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I mean, the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> was busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , most of the Jews, I would say like 97 percent of the Jews or 95 percent of the Jews were Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And they controlled -- they were the big merchants 1n these geveldelach, these little <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">But there was a little <span class="NPIP">corner</span> where the Greeks had established themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Now, Greek Jews had a hard time, and many of them were deported, and lived and died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">They were a rough and ready group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">These Jews that I met there, were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">They lived on the <span class="DLF">waterfront</span> and worked the <span class="DLF">waterfront</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They were people known for their roughness, you know, their occupations, and all of the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And they ran these businesses and competed with the Poles, and the Poles didn't like these Greek Jews taking some of their business away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">There was an ethnic competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And fights would break out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And they were bloody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I mean, they were fighting with clubs and knives, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And we decided that we had to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">We had to get these Greeks out of there, otherwise there would be deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">But I do recall that in one fight between the Greek Jews and the Polish Jews that the Greek Jews went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , where there was a colony of Greeks, who had also suffered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">They had been dragged in as forced labor, and called on them to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> to fight the Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">In other words, there was a Greek ethnic solidarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">It was unprecedented in a sense, solidarity against the Polish ethnic group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Well, the end was, we reached a decision that they would have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">We would find <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for them in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">But then began a great problem because they had established businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">They liked it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> , and they didn't want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And then the cry went up from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">They had a rabbi there, by the way, a Greek Sephardic rabbi, who was a survivor himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">He came and charged us, charged me right in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , with doing, for the second time, what had been done to the Greek Jews, that 1s, a deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">It wasn't a deport - but it was for dramatic effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And we were very sensitive to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">We were trying to save these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">There would have undoubtedly been a death, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">But you know what they did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">They were in touch with a famous Sephardic rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York-</span> he was a very close friend of Franklin Roosevelt, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">His name was Rabbi de Sola Pool. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I think he had a big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on <span class="DLF">5th Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And he sent us a message, telegram, which read “You are deporting my people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">You know, whatever, some charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And he came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He flew over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">He got permission to enter the <span class="REGION">zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">He met with us and made the same charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">But we explained to him what was involved here, that it was a lifesaving venture, that the Jews were not being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">They would have the same privileges they had in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">They may not be able to run those black market operations, but their rights were being protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">The thing settled down after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Then, I think, the Greeks drifted away, and maybe the Poles were initially involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I don't remember how it was ultimately settled, but it was quieted down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">But that was a very strange sort of an incident for us in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">QUESTION:  Was this an uncommon kind of thing, or were there lots of different kinds of fights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  There were lots of fights, but as I say, none of them on this ethnic basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">There would be fights about “you aced me out of this”, or “you swindled me”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And we would try to settle those things ourselves, or they would settle them themselves, that is, through a deen Torah, through a <span class="BUILDING">rabbinic court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">The decisions of that <span class="BUILDING">rabbinic court</span> were obeyed to the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And there were some very big sums of money involved, I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">So the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , as I say, played a powerful -- I hear it to this very day -- a powerful role in defining the Jewish survivor community in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And it was an unjust one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I was once in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> with a group of American officials going someplace, some meeting and somebody sitting next to me, some army officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248"> And we passed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camp</span> , and we could see the big sign, a Magen David <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">He said to me, “You know, I wouldn't go in there if my life depended on it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">I said, “Why?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">He didn't know I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">He expressed great fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">He had heard about the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , you know, a bunch of cut throats, and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">It was so stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">But that attitude was very strongly held in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">Patton himself spoke in the most anti-Semitic terms about Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Couldn't stand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">Hated Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Called them sub-humans, I think, at one point he 1s quoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">You know, he was killed about 25 or 30 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> in an automobile accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I saw a documentary on Patton the other day, a couple of weeks ago, in which Eisenhower comes to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to give him the bad news, that because of various comments he had made, you know — Patton had organized an S.S. military unit after the war, which was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And these troopers, he explained, were getting ready to fight the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And of course, he retained Nazi officials in the Bavarian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">So when it got to be too much, they ordered him transferred or downgraded, so he was appointed the commanding officer of the 15th Army or something, which was an army which only kept a history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">It had about 150 troops or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">But Eisenhower is portrayed in this documentary, coming in to talk to Patton, to explain to him why he is being transferred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And Patton says now one more thing, he said, “I am here by order of the president,” he said, “to check into conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And that was the time, I saw it on the film, that he had come to see us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">So it was an important visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1270">QUESTION:  Why do you think there was such a reputation about Jews since lots of people were involved in the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">ANSWER:  Well, anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">It was a stereotype of the Jew that had existed prior to World War IT. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Anti-Semitism was very great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">People who study anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> say it reached a peak precisely at the end of World War II, after the Nazis were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">That’s when it rose here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">There was strong anti-Semitism, and the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> seemed to fit the stereotype, those notions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1277">QUESTION:  Were you bothered by behaviors of DPs, whether they were Jewish or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">You can't come out of a situation like this into so-called peace with --
ANSWER:  Was I bothered in what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1279">QUESTION:  Well, there was a lot of lying, there had to be a lot of lying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1280">ANSWER:  Well, incessant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">The lying was a response to unreasonable situations for these Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">They were going to be locked up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for years to come because McCarren, the senator from <span class="REGION">Nevada</span> , decided he didn't want any Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and some others along with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I mean, it was an intolerable situation, so that anything you did to frustrate that or get around that made sense, and made ethical sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">But there were some things which were very questionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1285">QUESTION:  Do you think that was a function of having gone through such an inhuman situation that one came --
ANSWER:  You mean for the DPs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1286">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1287">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">That was the only way you could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Otherwise, I would say most would be dead, would be gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">If they all obeyed what the existing law was, and didn't steal food or change documents, they’d be gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">It was clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">That was a way of coping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And to the degree that I could, I helped them cope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1294">QUESTION:  You described the visage of the partisan, of the fighter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">QUESTION:  Yeah, the nonpartisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">ANSWER:  Yeah, I felt the people who were the most aggressive and most active were people who -- had been -- had not been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">That's just an instinctive feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">I know that if somebody listens to that, they are going to get angry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">But that was my sense as I saw these two groups of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">There was a kind of -- among the people, especially who had been soldiers or who had been partisans just by chance -- you didn't get to be a partisan because you went up and volunteered and the others would not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">It was just where you happened to be at a given moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">They had a kind of "in your face" attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">You know, screw you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Fool around with me and you are going to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">I had a problem coping with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">There was one guy I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">He was in my <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">I used to sit as a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And he went and took firewood, from the guy next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I said to him, when he was caught at it, I said, "What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">Why do you steal from your fellow Jews?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">He said to me, “That’s not stealing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">This is in Yiddish, he said, “/ch hob nohr organiziert.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">He said he “organized” it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">But there was a defiance there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I could tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">It was sort of hands on -- you have seen that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I have to show you that picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">QUESTION:  Did you notice a difference between the female deportees and the male deportees in terms of being able to be aggressive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">The women, I found the women aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">They were tough-minded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">They looked tough-minded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">They dressed in whatever they could, whatever you could find, and the women were very practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">They wore schtivl, boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">In the muck, in the mire and holes in the ground, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">That was very practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And they really looked very able and very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I remember the women who went to make aliyah knew what they were going into and they were strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">I remember a couple, Feigher was the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and she dragged him along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And I knew she would cope with anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">So they were tough, I mean, they were all tough.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I think they probably -- those people had been in the DP, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , of course -- knew because they were cheek and jowl beside the people with the different markers on their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">That is, marker for gays, for gypsies, for political opponents, criminals, and various categories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">So they knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">But there was very little patience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I mean, there was very little time to call a meeting, or whatever, or to meet with them, or to express some protests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I think there was some embarrassment about gays, if I am not mistaken, put in the same category. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">I think now, in later years, that survivors have matured on that score. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">I hear it in my own community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">But there was really no time for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">No particular access, no way to make it manifest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">Now, we talked also about entertainment and culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">That became an unbelievable frenzy of activity in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , all of them, all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">Newspapers were organized -- numbers of them representing different aspects, different movements within Zionism or different views or different thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And the publishing business was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">We also had very active theater in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1403">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">How did they publish these papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1405">ANSWER:  Well, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">German printing firms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">I think they found, I think, somewhere through the help of Jewish agencies, what do you call it, not linotype, typesetting kits in the Yiddishe buchstaben, Yiddish Hebrew letters, was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to printers, and they were contracted with by the newspaper publishers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">And pamphlets were being published. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">People began immediately to write about their experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">I remember people bringing me books, small books were published. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">As I say, there was an unbelievable, I would call 1t a frenzy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">And then there was <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , all sorts of <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , dramas, a little hammy, you know, not too great, but they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I had a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> built out of lumber that we got with cigarettes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Fretmann</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">And plays were presented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">Many of them were traditional plays with the Jewish problems, with the children, and with marriage, and with going away, and all of the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">I don't recall anything that had any political themes -- but I didn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> too often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">But as I say, concerts were being played all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">Musicians would come from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">I am trying to remember, a number of concert violinists came over to entertain in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">Q: — Bernstein?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1421">ANSWER:  No, he is a pianist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1422">QUESTION:  Leonard Bernstein?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1423">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">He came, but he came initially to conduct the Munich Symphony Orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">Shall I tell you about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">That is unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And he performed in the <span class="BUILDING">Bavarian Opera House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">The regular <span class="BUILDING">concert hall</span> had been destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">This <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> , I remember, was on Prince Ragetin Strasse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">By the way, it was right next door to the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> which had Hitler's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with his lover Eva Braun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">But anyway, Bernstein came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">There was a lot of anger on the part of Jews: “Vos kumt er?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Why is he coming here to entertain the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">I went to hear him, I went to see the concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">We were seated pretty close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">With cigarettes, you can get all kinds of better <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">It was wintertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">I am trying to remember, I think it was the spring of ’46 and it was still pretty cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">There was a shortage of soap in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And whenever you went into a crowd where Germans were crowding into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or German Jews the body odors were just horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Anyway, we sat down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">The <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was packed just up to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">I had never seen Bernstein before, except maybe a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">When he came out, the orchestra was seated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">Now he comes out — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that was just destroyed -- in his white full dress suit and in that darkness, this dark-looking, handsome, very handsome-looking fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">It was like a thunderbolt in that <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">There was a moment of silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">People were not quite sure how to respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">And suddenly, applause, which I thought would tear the <span class="DLF">roof</span> off the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">They were so enthusiastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">I subsequently felt that his appearance there, this Jewish guy, Just so soon after this tremendous raining down, death, and all that they had experienced, and everything else, was some sign they were still part of the world, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">They were still, in a sense, human. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">He has said that himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">I read it in a statement he made about the concert he gave in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , where there was also criticism of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Just swell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Then he began the concert and, of course, it was dramatic and magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">I am not a musical fiend, but I think he chose Mendelssohn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">He chose music that first was modern, post-modern or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">And then he played some things which had been forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">Mendelssohn, and I’m trying to remember, one or two things otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I am telling you, I will never forget that concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">The Jews did not participate in that, and they frowned upon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">Subsequently, in later years, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and there was another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">Again, there was a riot outside the <span class="BUILDING">concert hall</span> on the part of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1467"> You know who is the director of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wahnse</span> , the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was Dr. Fischer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">There was a famous Jewish doctor who was the head of the American Medical Association in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">His name was very famous in the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">His brother was the UNRRA director in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Anyway, because of the riot, he decided that whenever he made another appearance, he would go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camp</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">And Bernstein came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> to perform when he appeared again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> , Bernstein led a Jewish orchestra, which had been all Dachau inmates, prisoners of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">The Germans had caused that little orchestra to be created, and they used it to confuse the Red Cross officials that used to come occasionally, very, from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">There was an orchestra, about eight pieces or something. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1476">Abram, Avraham, Abrasha) Stupel was a Lithuanian Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">He was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And he would conduct -- I don't know what happened to him -- where he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">And then he conducted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">I provided the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , by the way, which was destroyed immediately after, I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">It was just an act on the part of the Jewish people carrying it, of revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">You know, they tossed it off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> it was being carried on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And oh, he played the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And they asked him to play Gershwin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">The Jews loved Gershwin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">He played a concerto about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> (“An American in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ”). </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And he played from “Porgy and Bess’”’, and just tore the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">And I saw Stupel present Bernstein with a Dachau striped haftling shirt, prisoner shirt, with the Jewish star on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And he wept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">He was so profoundly affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">So that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">The culture played an extremely important life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">Jews were just clinging to life in every way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">And they would have dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">I think I told you they danced to American music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And a very popular song, because everybody could say the words, and they would all yell it out and sing it, "Open de <span class="DLF">Door</span> , Richard," which was a big hit, I think, in 1946 or '7. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">And I'd go there occasionally to dance with some of the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">It was very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1499">QUESTION:  Were there poetry readings also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1500">ANSWER:  No, not poetry, but there were readings, declaamatzias, we used to call them, declamations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">Some of them had to do with the DP experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">Some of them were old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">I remember some of the declamations which were read were declamations, which my father read to us here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">That played a very important -- and the Jews were very dramatic and very much involved in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">But I know there was poetry written about the Holocaust period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">There was a guy, he was in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> for a brief time, and he went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Somebody got him out to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">His name begins with a"K", and he wrote songs which have become known as the ghetto songs, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> songs. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Zag nisht keinmal az du gehst dem letzten veg’’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">Have you heard that one? “‘</span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Never say that this is your last way to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">There were some other songs he had written, which were sung very emotionally by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">And he was a Polish Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">And he composed that song.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1515">QUESTION:  You mentioned in passing, when you were in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> watching Bernstein, and you would be in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> packed with people, because of the lack of soap, it smelled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1516">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1517">QUESTION:  What were the sanitation conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">What were the toilet facilities --
ANSWER:  It depended on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">In the beginning, when casernes -- caserne is a <span class="BUILDING">military building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">Flunt caserne, loch caserne, various <span class="NPIP">places</span> where soldiers were housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521"> It was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">I mean the conditions were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sinks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">There were these troughs which they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">There was no private <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , you know, primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">As time went on, things began to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">Neu Freimann came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">These were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and you had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sinks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">We distributed soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">We distributed sanitary materials, toilet paper, towels, and things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">Otherwise, people had to go out and organize it for themselves if they needed something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">But they worked out their own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">In <span class="NPIP">places</span> where there was <span class="BUILDING">community housing</span> , people used <span class="INT_SPACE">basins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">They would go to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">It was worked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">It was very difficult, but 1t was worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1537">QUESTION:  Were sanitary napkins brought in for women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1538">ANSWER:  Yes, we had sanitary napkins for women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">We had all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">It was a massive job of organization, of distributing the meats, you know, which were cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">We had to weigh them up, as we gave them out in a <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchen</span> , you would cook up a big bowl of meat, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">But in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where people were cooking by themselves, it had to be weighed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">We tried to be as equitable as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">We had <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , there was a good size <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> which contained <span class="INT_SPACE">operating rooms</span> , and I think about 60 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">It had been used by the Germans for the troops who were living in those <span class="BUILDING">casernes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">We found out later on that the equipment, including a pretty well- equipped <span class="INT_SPACE">surgical suite</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and the lights on top, was taken by the Germans, as they were wont to do, from the Romanians, who were their sort of partial allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">The Germans just packed up this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and just shipped it right off to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">Now, we were using that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">It was very, very important to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">We had people operating in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">We had all of the equipment, surgical tools, and all of the rest, pretty well-equipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">One day, I got a letter from General Clarence Huebner, who was by then the commandant of the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">The letter said that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> is going to be returned, as of such and such a date, to the Romanian government, and that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had agreed that this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , which had been taken by the Germans, would now be returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">Well, I was stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">The doctors came and saw me, and we discussed what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">So I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to see Huebner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">I am trying to remember where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">By the way, he ended up, ultimately, as the Director of Civil Defense for the State of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">He was a decent man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">I said to him, you know, “These are people who have all sorts of illnesses and problems which they received as a result of the years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and the years of their treatment, and if you take it away, people are going to die.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">He said he agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">He said, “I am going to appeal this decision.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">And we won it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">We kept the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">There was also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , a <span class="DLF">trunk line</span> going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , and we shipped foodstuffs, coal, wood, and other supplies on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> and two or three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> ran along the short <span class="DLF">line</span> , about two miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And they wanted that back, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">That also came from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And we beat them on that one, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">Because if they had done that, if we didn't have that short spur, I don't know how we would have gotten tons of potatoes and fuel and other stuff into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">All kinds of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">Germans said we were holding their stuff, and we had to fight them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">We had all kinds of difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">Now the Israelis came, people checking on immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">Dentists came to check the teeth of people going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because they did not want to have an enormous dental burden at the time that the state was being established. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">And they had all kinds of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">So we had a <span class="BUILDING">dental clinic</span> , which was equipped by the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">They gave us about 15 or so <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , which were run, not by electricity, but by a foot pedal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">And we had 15 or so dentists, zahnarzt in there, doing dental work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581"> But now something interesting happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">Some of these dentists had been in the Soviet Union during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">And they’d learned the Soviet system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">So what would happen was, a Jew would come in a DP and he’d get free dental care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">He would present himself and the dentist would say “Look, my friend, I can't take you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">It’s very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">It will be about a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">Come back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">And this guy has a toothache. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">He says, “I can't come back in a month.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">So then the dentist would say -- and this 1s exactly a duplicate of Soviet system corruption in <span class="DLF">plumbing</span> or anything -- “Look, I will tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">If you want fast service, you come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">I have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dental chair</span> and I will take you right away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">You understand there was a competition between UNRRA and this guy's private interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">And I can't tell you what happened, what used to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">Then they were competing among themselves for the business, and they were doing things to patients of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">We had a big scandal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">I am not going to tell you all, because it is too horrible to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">But we had to reform that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">We had to kick some people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">It was “Nellie Bar the <span class="DLF">Door</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">But imagine, altogether, we did get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gehretzreid</span> was open, this <span class="BUILDING">Israeli departure center</span> we had, suddenly thousands of people began to show up from all over, Jews, to be processed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604"> We had a dental problem of enormous proportions in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gehretzreid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">But as I say, everything, I guess, seemed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">Sometimes you turned your head away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">I don't want to hear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">And when you turn back, it was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1609">QUESTION:  Were a lot of the dental problems a function of the --
ANSWER:  Of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">Lack of diet and the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">You see people with occluded, badly occluded, teeth falling out, rotting gums, and all of the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1612">QUESTION:  And you actually had facilities to give people dentures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1613">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">I forgot to mention, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and some of the instrumentation came from the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">But teeth and drugs and other things came from the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">They did a fantastic job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1617">QUESTION:  What other effects, physical effects did you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">Were there people with -- I don't know -- broken legs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1619">ANSWER:  We had all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">One of the most visible effects was the distended stomachs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">Women, you could see a lot on women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">I don't know whether it occurs more on women than on men, but I don't know what produces that but when you are underfed for a long time, children, babies you see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">You have distention of the stomachs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">I remember there was a Hungarian woman, who was a clerk, a brilliant, intellectual woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">I sent her to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">And she was to marry a guy from her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who was a doctor here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">When I came over, I met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">And he met me, took me aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And he said, "Look at her stomach." </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">He spoke about her distention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">Eventually, she ended up in the New York Public Library as the curator of the Hungarian collection -- they have a big Hungarian collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1633">QUESTION:  How long did you see the effects? </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">The physical kind of --
ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">I think I saw them all of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">They always looked bad to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">I could tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">Until they really came over here and stayed here for a couple of years, I could see, I could just look, pass somebody in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and say that's a Jewish DP. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">There was something about them physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">Of course, they had scars of various sorts, the numbers and -- it's tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1641">QUESTION:  What about education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1642">ANSWER:  Now -- yeah, education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">There was adult education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">And there was ORT, <span class="BUILDING">trade schools</span> , fachshul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">We had a problem getting, especially men, not the women, men into these <span class="BUILDING">trades schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">I don't know, they were not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">They didn't see their future as working as watchmakers or tooth technicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">We had to convince them by giving them Joint packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649"> Not we, the ORT did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">Rabbi Max Braude, who had been a chaplain in the military, did some work with DPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">And when he came back here, he was named World ORT Director. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">Anyway, they had to give them special inducements which were packages, a supplementary packet, to get them into these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">This happened while Eisenhower was there, and looked in at a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">We took him to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and a guy had gone to two <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , he got two packages, and he really didn't attend either one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">We had a problem with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">That was one of the unattractive things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">I remember, Jews were very good working 1n <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they had some authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">They were clerks, assigning people to <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , or doing whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">But when it came to some of the physical things, stacking wood, clearing away garbage, forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660"> We could not get any volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">So one day, a group of American Jews came through one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and they passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">They saw it looked like maybe a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">A guy sitting in the sun smoking cigarettes, and nearby a German is working, cleaning up the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">So the American, applying his standards, called the guy over and said in Yiddish, "Why aren't you working? </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">This is your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , this is where you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">Why aren't you cleaning up?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">The man replied, "I worked for them for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">Now they will work for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">That's what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">I don't know whether it was a rationalization, but, you know, that kind of work is not attractive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">We see it in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">Even Russians who come, or even the Jews who came, they don't clean up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">The Palestinians, Arabs were cleaning up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">And that 1s still happening today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">And we had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">We were trying to convince the people because it is an American tradition that you work in your own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">It's your <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">We had a lot of vandalism, for example, within the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">And it was irresponsible, sometimes done in anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">They would tear banisters off the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were German-owned, and they were saying, “To hell with them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">But they didn't realize that other Jews, when they left, had to come in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">And then, ultimately, Uncle Sam picked up the bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">All these <span class="NPIP">places</span> were brought back spanking new by the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">They had that commitment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">That included the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I lived in, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">We would have some wild parties there, and they would tear down pictures from the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1688">QUESTION:  You lived in a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1689">ANSWER:  I lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , yeah, big <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1690">QUESTION:  With a maid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1691">ANSWER:  Two maids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">A cook and a maid. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1693">Vas felt er?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">my mother would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1695">QUESTION:  Did they teach languages there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1696">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">Now most were English classes, given by people who spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">They were very good and very useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">There was elementary school education for small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> were organized and they were quite good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">And there was confusion as to what language -- should they learn Hebrew? </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">Where were you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">If you're going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , you had to learn some Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">If you were going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you learned English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">But they were very assiduous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">We suffered shortages of supplies, mainly, but we made do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> , I have to talk about, there were <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">All of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were named after Nazis when the camp was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">You had <span class="DLF">Adolph Hitler Platz</span> , <span class="DLF">Goebbels Strasse</span> , <span class="DLF">Goering Strasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">And of course, no Jew is going to say he lives on <span class="DLF">Goering Strasse</span> or on <span class="DLF">Adolph Hitler Platz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">So they tore all these signs down, and they named these <span class="DLF">streets</span> after <span class="REGION">American states</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">And that was constantly a source of humor. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1713">Vu voynt er? </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">Where do you live? </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">On the Michiganiga Gass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">They added a syllable, so <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> became Michiganiga. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1717">Ich voyn oyf dem kantuzki” because the "C" in Polish 1s a sibilant like an "S." That's the way they named their <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">It was so funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">It was very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">An American would come in and ask him where do you live, he would say Ochyo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">What? </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">Ochyo -- <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1723">QUESTION:  Ok, let’s cut the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1724">ANSWER:  Well, I want to say a few words about the meaning, the significance for the Jewish community, for Jewish history, of the whole DP experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">We are commanded to communicate to the world what it is Jews experienced during this period of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">And the principal vehicle for that is the DP survivor community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">Both those survivors who survived the horrors, and they are a smaller number of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> , and those who survived by fleeing into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , or fighting in the Soviet army, or living as refugees within the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">Without them, the world would not know anything at all about these experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">So I think, to the degree that we are commanded to tell the story and retell 1t to generations which follow us, they serve this vital purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">They are also an indication of the vitality, the will to life, and to survival of the Jewish community, both the survivors and the rest of us, who face formidable challenges to our survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">These people were so grimly determined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">It used to seem to me that if I had children, I would say to them maybe I don't want them to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">Who needs that kind of threat hanging over our lives? </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">Yet, these people produced children, recreated their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">We could not provide the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , to birth these children that they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">A great will, a great desire, even to be found in the so-called <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , to provide the means for survival and the means to support whatever families they would create. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">They were really the phoenix rising out of the ashes of European Jewry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">And they have gone on to produce great things, both here and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">All over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I know Jews who are survivors and are wonderfully contributing members of society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">There is so much talk about immigrants coming tn, and the threats which are posed by immigrants to the American economy and the American people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">The Jews of Europe who came here did nothing but produce life and energy and things that we need in order to maintain the richness of our society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">So it's an important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">We have to be truly thankful to these people and understanding of who they were, what motivated them, and the dangers which they lived through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">Even after the Holocaust appeared to have ended came this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">We know so much about the sufferings, but now we ought to know more about the work which they did, the sacrifices which they have made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">Do you agree with me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1747">ANSWER:  That was very well put. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">End of Tape #3 End of Interview </span>
