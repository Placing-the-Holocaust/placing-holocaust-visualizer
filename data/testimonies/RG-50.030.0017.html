<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Now, your life was difficult because your mother had so many of you to take care of, but perhaps you have good memories before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Good memories, yes, good memories, little bit, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And time when my mother couldn't support everything and I was -- it was time to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and first time I was in <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> there was no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and Polish and I was there but I was maybe lucky, maybe my mother was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">She sent me to Dr. Korezak’. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was in <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> by <span class="BUILDING">Korczak</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Maybe you know about Korczak, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Now, let me just hear a little bit more about your lifestyle first, and then I do want to talk more about Dr. Korczak. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  And many of your friends and neighbors were Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Most of them was Christian, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Perhaps some Jewish too, but just in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we were living there was not many Jews, was most Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And we was living- like I can remember -- it was good because even I don't know what different between Christian or not Christian so. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I remember just once when it was holidays, Passover, so we ' Janusz Korczak (1879-1942), physician, writer, and educator. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">In 1912 he was appointed director the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> at <span class="DLF">Krochmalna Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">had change and we give them matzos, and they bake beautiful nice cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And this was the difference between a Jew and non-Jew and that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  So you had a good relations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  We had a very good relationship, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I think my father, my mother, she have too good relationship with these peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Did you do anything that was very uniquely Jewish, other than the holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Yes, because we went before to go to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> my parents would send me, send - us, brothers too, in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish cheder</span> *. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Maybe you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">This is most <span class="BUILDING">religion school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So that's the one that was really different between the Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  So your parents were fairly religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Not very religious, but like maybe more than in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But my father keep always the Sabbath and my mother she prepare always for the Friday, like a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Did you experience or were you aware of any antisemitism before Hitler came to power or before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Yes, lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">This would be after my father die, so you know when we becoming older already say we understood more and even on the <span class="DLF">street</span> “Jew, Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was always the young people, they beating us and they make all kinds of stories, all kinds of things, because we was Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I didn't see any difference, but maybe they saw the difference between Jew and non-Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  By these were the same people that you were friendly with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But when they are coming older maybe they was more antisemitic — that’s one of the reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Maybe the parents teach them like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Maybe when in the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , when they go to the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> the priest say, “Don't buy by Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Don’t.... Kill the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Because they killed our Jesus Christus.” </span><span class="sentence" id="61">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  So this was at a time when Hitler had come to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  That's when all before the war -- far before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">This one, like I say, it was between 1930, '35, 734, °33, °34, ’35.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  And these were the same people that you said a few minutes ago you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with? * </span><span class="sentence" id="66"><span class="BUILDING">Orthodox primary school</span> (Yiddish).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Yeah, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But even in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when we went the first time and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , so it was always that the -- but in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the people were very religious and when it’s coming the time to religion -- we don't have to -- but I went out, out from the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , and so after “Jew, Jew, Jew,” and if they couldn't, they beat us because look, we was just couple youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Not so many like them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We are scared from them and they take advantage of us, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was very, very hard this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So even like youngster, and believe me I don't know, I couldn't understand why, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Because I'm Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I don't see no difference because I was the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We don't have no horn. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We don't have nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We took the same language. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We eat the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And they was so -- they kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">If they can't kill, they beat us. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They make all kind of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Sometimes, we saw, they break the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They break all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Because they were -- they're Jewish family, and believe me at this time we were very, very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I remember mine <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">When my father died we were very, very poor because we had my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">She was with seven kids and support seven kids wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">She have a very, very, very hard life. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Very hard life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  What did you know about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before you were invaded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Lots of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The truth, just what we read sometimes in the paper, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The Nationalsozialistische Partei’, they win, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">At this time it was Hindenburg’ -- Hindenburg lose the power and the German took the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So when the- 1939 -- just when it was Rosh Hashanah is decreed the war was starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So the Germans start to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe that the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> going to lose the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But at this time I was very young so maybe I don't understood very well, but I remember once my mother told me — she told us, “You know what, you’ll see, when the Germans come in here, I don't think they are going to handle with us very badly because they not the antisemites like the Polacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Because,” she say, ‘I remember in the war in 1914-18 they were very friendly, because we Jews are speaking Jewish”, and the Jewish is a lot like German so we could understood altogether.” </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And 1t wasn’t -- was like she was saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  So, you all knew what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but you thought that it wouldn't happen to you in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  What happen German, I don't know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Because maybe I know what we read in the * National Socialist Party (German); Nazi political party in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . * </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Paul von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1847-1934); German army officer and statesman, president of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 1925-1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">> Yiddish papers, but, you know, we couldn't have no radios, no TV’s and the media was not strong like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So we don't know exactly everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But one thing I remember is when Hitler is coming on power, they send out most the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And the Jews, they come into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and lots coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and we was talking with them and they tell us what kind of pogrom was there, you know, with the Kristallnacht and the beating and the -- don't let live the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The Jews have no right, the Jews was second, even not the second citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They couldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They couldn't have absolute nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So we know already there is trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first day of the war or when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was occupied, do you remember what was happening?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  So this was in the <span class="BUILDING">bath house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  That was in the <span class="BUILDING">bath house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  And there was Polish people and Jewish people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  All together, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But as soon as the German come in, you know, they saw what is all the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We were treated a little bit better because from the Jews, but we were always scared to go out because it was not very, very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Not easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  How long were you in this <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  I can't tell you exactly how long because--
QUESTION:  Days, weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  It was couple, maybe one or two weeks until we find a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> very, very far out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there we was maybe the whole time until -- this was 1939, and 1939, '40 the winter was very, very hard winter so we stay there until 1t makes 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I think 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So, I was, I was by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korezak</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Let me just ask you a question and then I want to ask you about the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">When you were in this <span class="BUILDING">bath house</span> , wasn't there any feeling of -- I don't know -- camaraderie, between the Polish people and the Jewish people because, in fact, you were all being invaded by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Not special, not special. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Because first of all, I don't know, we was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">If the Polish people was scared from the Germans, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But it was, there was a distance between the Jewish people and the Polish people because the German they start already -- the Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They take away everything from the Jews and they start to talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they start, you know, every Jew have to have, you know, the Jew shtern’®. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So we -- there was a certain distance between the Polish and the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Maybe the Polish thought they could protect themselves by separating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  You know, it's very hard to tell you, because the Polish people -- I going to tell you just once. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The antisemitic by the Polish people -- by the Polish woman there was already inject in the breast of from the woman and they give it to the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But the children took the breast from their mothers and start to give them the milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They give them the hateness for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And it was all over, all over, every time you have always, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Even sometimes you know this day I remember I stay up about two, three o'clock in the night to make a <span class="DLF">line</span> to have a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And when one Polack or somebody see a man what is a Jew, they threw him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They kicked him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They beat him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  And yet your early memories were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Early memories everybody was friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It all changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  That doesn't change. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And I think nothing change today. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I don't think something change ° star (Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="179">today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  But what I am saying is when you were young you lived around a lot of Polish people and everybody was friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Because, you know, everybody was friends because we was young, little one. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So we don't see the difference but in the moment when we come just to the reason, the moment when the brain start to work, they change. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They change today because maybe, like I say, maybe the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , maybe the priest, maybe they put the poison in this brains. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Maybe the brainwash you, I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They always know that they pretend always, “The Jews they kill Christus -- Jesus Christus.” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">What I have to do with 2000 years with all this thing?</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I come on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and it was two gendarmes and they threw out a family from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- maybe they want to take the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- and they threw out and they say “Hey, come here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And they say, “help,” and I help these people to put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And I remember it, was a bread, a big, big bread and the bread fell down and the hard side fell down. </span><span

class="sentence" id="770">And I go to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and I ask, “Maybe you have <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep?” </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So it's an old <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">They say, “Look, I have one <span class="NPIP">place</span> but here you can sleep -- there is a lady laying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> -- 1f you want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So the lady in one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">The whole night I eat this bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">The next day, in the morning, I say, “off.” </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I was in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">But in certain time the peoples from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they need papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I don't have no papers and the paper was, you know, the fingerprint and this one is the Bloody Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">The Gestapo come in, 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they throw out -- everybody have to go out, and they start to control the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I don't have no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">My brother doesn't have papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">If he don't have no papers, so they have to start to hit the stakes over the head, over the back, all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Because if you don't have paper, you have to go on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span

(German) concentration, if it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And so the SS, I hear what they say, “We going put the prisoners there and we going to have a rest for one or two days.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">Because, I think, they was tired, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">But the chief in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> he doesn’t want to let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">And in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and they make a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> -- you know what a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> is -- in case the fliers come in to bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And so the people from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> can go in and to be safe, but it doesn't make it right through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">And the chief say, “Okay, we going to put the prisoners over there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">They put us there and it was not so very high and so it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">Everybody go on the end but it was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">You couldn't go nowhere because it was not finished, it was not finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">The compress us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">All the things was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , so I went there too, and it

they wanting the chief, the commandant in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">They make soup, you know, liquid soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">So I have it was a part with me, and I say I going to go in the front every time and I going to take a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">I have to eat, so I take one and I say I going to take one, and I have a nice time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">In meantime we start to missing <span class="DLF">air</span> in the end, no <span class="DLF">air</span> , no <span class="DLF">air</span> , and everybody want to go in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">So like here, you have the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">When you open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , it was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- “This one for me -- a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I gonna go there, I go to hide there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">Nobody going to see me and I have the fresh air.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">And the front was two SS and every time when the peoples want to go to the front, they shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">They kill them and they kill lots of peoples. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">And they put in -- there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> in front so nobody can go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">What I going to tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">I can't describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">There was screaming and crying and the peoples, they running to the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">They licked the <span class="DLF">walls</span> because it was wet from the no <span class="DLF">air</span> , and you see the oxide coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">It was there in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">It was about six o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">It was dark and the front was the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">They let nobody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">We have to stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> until the next day in the morning, and the morning was lights come in, maybe eight o'clock and they called all the SS to come in, and they let out the people that was still alive, and the firework was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">They couldn't go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">They had to take the gas mask, they couldn’t go in the end and from the end they took out peoples there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">Dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">Maybe 100, 150 people was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">And some peoples could survive on the end, coming out after five, six minutes they <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , they fell down and die because the lungs, they couldn't support. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">And I was there maybe couple days, and they took the dead peoples put between the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> outside, they all frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">Food, no question about food for us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">And about eight days later we have to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">And we start again to walk, and the order was to shoot the people, to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">But they couldn't kill us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because it civil people there and they couldn't -- they doesn't want to give us to deliver to the Russian, because the Russians coming from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">And they don't want to give us to the American soldier, but the American was too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">So we was between and we was walking every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">Every day we was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">It was a couple SS and they pull out peoples and they shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">So I say, “God, something happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">I won't survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">So I have -- on my side it was a little SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">He was -- I don't know if he was from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , an older man, maybe 60, maybe more, and he have on backsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">So I say to him, “Look, you not a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">Give me your back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">I going to carry them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">So he say, “Why you want to do that?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1684">I want to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">You tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">I want to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">I think that's good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">So he take out -- he give me the thing he was walking just on the side from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">So every time they eat, they have food, they have bread, so he give me just a piece of bread for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">It was good and I can walk, first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">Second, I was sure no SS going to come and grab me to kill me because I have his things, and he going to take care of it because he want already — I have — SS they want to come in and grab me he say, “Uh-oh, don't touch it’s mine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">So I was already
