<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  How did that make you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  It didn’t really bother us. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">You know, we knew that we didn’t sing the hymns and that sort of thing, so we waited <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we usually sort of chatted among each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Then after the prayers were finished, then we walked in and we had -- we June 12, 2006 were told the general news that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">There was no anti-Semitism in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as I remember it.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Were -- did your parents raise you to be independent? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">How did they raise their children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  They raised us to be independent, but I think they would have been very unhappy had we not dated Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Let’s start talking now about when you noticed a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You said you were born in 1923?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  So you were very young, of course, when Hitler came into power in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Do you -- wha-what is your first memory of this man named Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Do you -- can you recall when that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  You know, I don’t really, but we went abroad on vacation and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , now called the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and we always went to Jewish -- <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hotels</span> if possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we were in this -- in this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hotel</span> in -- I think it was [indecipherable] just outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And we were all eating at dinner and three men walked in and they looked round all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and they talked among themselves and then they walked out again and we were told that they were Nazis, looking for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That was the first that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And that was about -- perhaps about 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  So y-you as a child weren’t aware before 1936 that -- that conditions were changing at all -- were -- I mean, were -- or were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Did your parents talk about it, did you -- you were able to read, of course, or listen to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Did you have any inkling as a youngster?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Yes, we did, and I think that we did more than other people, cause of course my parent talked about it to us and -- and we heard them sort of talking among themselves and I remember very, very clearly that my father had a book, and in it there were -- there were diagrams, or there were photographs of Jewish men in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that had been beaten, and I remember that very, very clearly and it has stuck with me fa -- all through the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So my father was desperately concerned about what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Did you have relatives on the continent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Not -- no, I think that my mother had we didn’t seem to have contact with them, but I remember -- and my sister jogged my memory on this, that we used to see my mother tying up packages with cord and with thick paper to send to -- to send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But I -- but I don’t know who they were, and I don’t know -- and they didn’t - | mean, we didn’t hear anything about it afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  When you saw those upsetting photographs, did you talk that over with your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  My father talked about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he was desperately concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He was desperately concerned about the probability of war and of what might happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And he was very, very concerned to the point that when the war seemed inevitable, he and my mother drove around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , looking for a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we could live in and -- outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because we didn’t know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> will be bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And they eventually found this beautiful <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> 30 miles away in -- in the [indecipherable] in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walkerburn</span> , and we lived there for two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Wh-When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  It was from 1939 til 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But they had been looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And of course when -- when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell, and they knew that the Germans were just across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> -- we thought it was a kind of an adventure, but he was desperately -- he was desperately concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Let’s move backwards a little bit before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">What about when Chamberlain went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , were -- did your parents talk about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Does that strike any memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Ta -- please tell me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  Yes, it did, and my father was very skeptical. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He could see what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He -- he must have had some kind of knowledge that other people didn’t have about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He could see what Hitler was doing, he could see that -- what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and then when he went into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and he just felt that Hitler was going to just run rampant unless he was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And of course, he worried desperately about -- about the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Did your father speak German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">My -- my parents spoke some Yiddish, especially when they didn’t want us to know what they were talking about, but not German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  And so he -- though he -- though he did not speak German, he obviously was reading and listening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I mean, he -- he was a very, very quiet man, but the things that he did, we found out afterwards, he -- he was looking out for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I mean, he was the sort of person that after he died, we found out that he’d been supporting the two -- two of my mother’s brothers that weren’t doing well in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , because they wrote to say, well why is it -- why has this stopped? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And then we found out that he’d been doing this, hadn’t told anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">He was just great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  And how would you describe your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  She was a lovely person. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Unfortunately, from when my brother was born, and he was five years younger than I, she was an invalid. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She had problems and she had periods of intense pain -- this 1s not being recorded, is it, no --
QUESTION:  Yeah, this 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She had -- she had gallstones. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And just after my brother was born and when she asked the doctors about surgery -- now this was in 1920 -- I mean, ’28 or something, they -- the doctors, they casually said, oh, if anything happens to you, your children will always have one parent left, so she never had the surgery. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And they got worse and worse and she suffered wi -- we never knew when she was having an attack, and she was in intense pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But she was wonderful, I mean, she -- as I say, she was one of the mainstays of the Jewish congregation, and she was in the heart of everything, and as I say, she was president of the Ladies Benevolent -- the society. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They were active in the Zionist Society, and then when war came along, she was a member of the -- of the Scottish National Council of Refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And she was the one who arranged for the 35 children to come in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dovercourt camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And this was not easy because there were only the 300 families and many of them didn't want to have the responsibility of taking refugees, but she found <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for all of these 35 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  All right, let’s talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">When eng -- when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in September 739 -- September 1*', 1939 --
ANSWER:  September -- yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Oh -- September 1“, 1939 --

<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  Speaking about good men, which your father an -- ce-certainly sounds like, was he -- was he unusual in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh community</span> or were there a lot of other men like him, who did so much and put so much effort and time and caring into these children? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Or was your father unique in this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Well, I know I’m prejudiced, but he we defin -- he was definitely unique and he was -- he was one of a kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">My uncle was a governor, but he didn't do half as much as what my -- my father’s whole heart and soul was tied up with this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and he was constantly sort of trying to find things for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Food was very strictly rationed, and he’d go around the <span class="DLF">farms</span> looking for eggs for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He would -- he would try and supplement the rations in every way he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I mean, he was always there for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  Now you were 16 - 17 - 18 - 19 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">You were obviously following what was happening and your parents, of course were following what was happening June 12, 2006 during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">What about the children? </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Were they also as aware, the children in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Oh, I’m quite sure they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">If you see 1 -- if you see the pictures that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has, that my sister provided, there is a whole -- a whole group of -- of mail they were getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I don’t know where they were getting it from, possibly from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but I mean, they knew what was going on and of course, you know, we had air raids, which they were involved with. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And -- and they had first -- and they had first aid classes, you know, they were taught to do what they had to do in case a bomb fell, this or this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They were -- they were very much aware, and -- this was a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, I mean, it -- we knew they must -- it must be so much heartbreak there, but you try and be there for them if they need it, -- but try and encourage them to go on with their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  So was it a memb -- a matter of lay people counseling these children, or were there any professionals there counseling these children psychologically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  You know, I don’t remember that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I was just a teenager myself and it was 60 years ago, so I honestly don’t remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  So what was your role with this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">As you say, you were 16 when it all started, what did you do in th -- in -- beginning then? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  I didn’t do very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">As you say, I wasn't old enough to drive then, and I used to go out with my parents and make friends with the children and do -- you know, try and make them feel comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My sister did have her license and she w- would often go out by herself at night and yeah -- and be wi -- I think it was about 15 or 20 miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and she would be there at night and she would be [indecipherable] with the children, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And she was the one that wrote the memoir and she possibly has better memories than I do, though when I talked to her the other night she said, I don’t remember, it was so long ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Ca-Can you describe what kind of farming techniques the children learned, you s -- had mentioned that they were learning that, agricultural techniques, in preparation for what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  I don’t know what kind of -- the techniques. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I know that when <span class="DLF">Whittingehame Farm</span> , the <span class="REGION">estate</span> was given to them, they were given the <span class="REGION">land</span> with it, and with the farmers that worked the <span class="REGION">land</span> and they took these children under their wing and they taught them the farming as they knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Now, I know that the idea was that if their parents were not still alive when they left, that they would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and many, many did go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> on kibbutzim -- on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">But I don’t know what kind of farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I know that I saw them on tractors, I saw them making hay, I saw them, you know, doing all this sort of thing and in these photographs that the June 12, 2006 <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has, it also shows that it was especially -- were taught how to sow <span class="DLF">fields</span> and this sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Did you have a sense that these children were coping well, or was there signs of depression among the children, when you would go out there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  I really was too young, but thinking about it now, I think that they were coping well. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I think that the matron was a very nurturing person. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I think that my mother was wonderful there, she was there to talk to them, and to be there for them if needed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The other thing was just that Chaim Weitzman, his wife was very, very much involved with it, and she -- Vera Weitzman, and she was out there a lot and -- and she worked with the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  Did she live nearby”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  I don’t know where she lived nearby, but she was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And actually, Viscountess Traprain’s wife, they lived in the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and his wife was always there too, helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So there was [indecipherable] and there’s a corps of women that were sort of there for the -- them if they needed, apart from working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and doing these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Did you sense any negative feeling among the non-Jewish residents in surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> about these Jewish children being there? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  Absolutely not, 1t was -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> apart from itself, it was set in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , amid <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But no, I didn't -- I didn’t see anything at all, or my parents didn’t either, I know, because I would have heard about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And so how often would you go out there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  We go out -- we would go out there a-at the weekends and perhaps one or two nights a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Did you stay overnight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  No, I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  And the children picked up English quite easily?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Yes, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">In fact, they did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">As I say, [indecipherable] had a very, very qualified teaching staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And after Mr. Maxwell left, they had a Jewish headmaster called Berner Cherig, who now, I believe, is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And they seemed to do very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">In fact, one of the -- in one of the photographs that we have, it shows the -- the girls all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sewing room</span> , and there’s a sign above it that says, speak Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  In Hebrew.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  Were all the staff Scottish? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I don’t think they were Jewish, I think they were -- that they were regular teaching staff, but I could be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Now, what were you doing from the age of 16 on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Well, the two years that I was in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I was -- we had a very, very large <span class="BUILDING">country house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It had seven <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and goodness knows how many <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> , and they had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apple room</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">gun room</span> , and I mean, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">It was a very, very sprawling <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , and -- and the domestics that we had all went to do war work, so they -- there we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , my mother was an invalid, so I was looking after the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And then, that time there was no central heating, so you know, you would light the fires in the morning for heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So the first thing I do was light the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> fire, light the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> fire, do these sort of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was looking after the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was -- I was very domesticated and I loved to -- I loved to cook, so that kept me busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And then when we went back -- back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> , I was accepted into the -- the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science, and I was there for two years and I got degrees in <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and institutional management. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And institutional management meant that you learned to cook for many, many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">In fact, after I got married, and with four boys, and my family used to tease me that I was still cooking for institutional management. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And so I June 12, 2006 graduated from there and then I was told that I had to do work of national importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Well --
QUESTION:  Th-This would be 1943 now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  Yes, possibly 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">My sister was already away doing work of national importance, and I was told that I had to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Well, my mother needed somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> , no staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So they said that I could stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Th-They wanted to make me what they called a messing officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">This is a British phrase. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">A messing officer is a commissioned officer in the British forces that -- that deals with -- with -- with the catering, the cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Looking after the troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They wanted me to be a messing officer and they said that I could -- I could stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> if I got a job of national importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So I went to work for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> ’s school system, sort of cooking meals for the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> -- for the Scottish schoolchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And what I did was this, I had to be there at six o’clock in the morning and it was dark, it was blackout, there was no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It was luckily about 15 minutes walk from where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I get -- I leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> about five -- I’d get up early, I would light the fires in our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I would wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span> , do everything that had to be done so my mother wouldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Then I’d leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at 5:30, walk to my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And what we had to do is we had to work with the food, so that the food had to be ready by 8:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Then it was put in insulated June 12, 2006 containers and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> used to take it off at 8:30 to the various <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And we were finished by three o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Well, after we sent the food out at 8:30, we began preparing the food for -- for the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And during that time I got a vaccination. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They had smallpox in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> , which came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And -- and without telling my parents I went to have a vaccination, because for some reason I was not vaccinated as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So I went to -- I went to get a vaccination that was not good and I had a very -- a very swollen arm, and the doctor said, you’re working too hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So they put me in -- in the -- in the largest <span class="BUILDING">wartime nursery</span> , it had a hun 150 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And I used to go -- I used to get the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram car</span> by that time, to this <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> and I used to go there and I used to cook for the 150 children and for the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And it was -- 1t was an old -- it was an old <span class="BUILDING">church</span> run by an -- and ran by an -- and ran by a <span class="DLF">canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And there were -- there were rats and this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I remember one year -- I lliked to knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">One year I made about 20 or 30 pairs of mitts for the children, to th -- when -- for Christmas and one year they -- the Duchess -- the Duchess of Kent was going to come to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Great excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And I had managed to hold some white flour, which was always, always unwrit -- unobtainable, and I made this wonderful cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I mean, I made this absolutely wonderful cake and took it in there and the next morning when the Duchess was supposed to come, they found out that the rats had eaten part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So this was a -- June 12, 2006 this was an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So I worked there and actually where I should backtrack and say that when I went to work for the -- for the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , after I was there for six months they say that would I be in charge of sending the food out to all the <span class="BUILDING">wartime nurseries</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> , which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I think there were about 1500 children, and I used to send out the food to all these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Then when I got this, the smallpox thing, I h -- I went to work for the largest <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And finally my mother’s health deteriorated and they said that I could stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And that’s when I started my volunteer work and I went to work -- I looked after her and I went to work at the Canadian Legion Services club on <span class="DLF">Princess Street</span> , which is the main <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always open <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I mean, when -- I mean, for Pesach, for Thanksgiving, any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We always had lots of people and f-for our two Seders, -- we always had four or five or six servicemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So we had open <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we always had many, many servicemen coming back, and it was very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I

ANSWER:  That I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I’m -- I’m pretty sure that they must have visited and they must have come and talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I’m not sure if they actually taught them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So there was no religious trainings? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">It was more secular, Hebrew, conversational Hebrew to get them ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  How -- how did you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Well, news was getting through by this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I mean, news were getting through by this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And of course, the children that came on the -- on the Kindertransport and our own boys were very much aware of how -- how their parents had been treated, what was happening over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So we knew, probably far more than the non-Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So we did know what was happening and it is a very tense time, you know, because -- because when, one by one, the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> over -- over in Europe fell, and we were left by ourselves -- we were only 18 or 20 miles from the -- from the German troops, and -- and my father especially was desperately concerned about it, because you know, he - what were -- what was June 12, 2006 going to happen to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Were -- were we going to be sent over to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ourselves? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">It was -- it -- it was a -- I realize now, far more than I ever did when I growing up, what it must have been like for them, for our parents, cause I often think, what would I have done if this had happened when I had -- had my four boys? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And luckily -- I mean luckily, but luckily, none of my family actually went and were killed, but we saw it all around us, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">My brother was too young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  And when did the correspondence between the children in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and Whittingehame and their families stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I mean, I don’t know where the correspondence came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I can only think that it must have come through -- through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> because when I was -- when I was transcribing it for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> I -- I did a very touching series in which this little girl had been sent on the Kindertransport to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and she was writing to her parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they were each trying to buoy each others up, and the little girl was saying, you know, what is happening over there? </span><span class="sentence" id="547">How are things with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And the parents were saying -- they had a <span class="BUILDING">guest house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- oh, everything’s wonderful, this is happening, this is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And you could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And then -- and then finally, when war broke out, the little girl said [indecipherable] said, what am I going to do, I can’t write to you any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And I have this on the computer here. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It’s a heartbreaking thing, but I June 12, 2006 realize that from the time that war broke out, that all correspondence, it did stop and that any that came through must have come by through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So I mean, I don’t know where the letters came from.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  And they started speaking with Scottish accents. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">End of Tape One, Side B June 12, 2006 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Hilda Seftor. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">This is tape number two, side A. Did Agon and Max, the two young boys who moved in with your family, whom your family quote, adopted, ever come with your family after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  Yes, they usually came with us unless they had something else that they -- that they wanted to do or had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">They came with us as part of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I think that they liked to be with the other children, I think that they gave a feeling of almost family, you know, that there were other children who -- who were not so Scottish. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And it -- it worked out very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  When they would go, how would they talk to the children, in English, or in German, or how would they talk to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  I think they would ha -- have to talk in English, because I think that the language that they spoke would not be very easily understood by -- by other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  And t-tell me a little bit about the high holidays and whether the children at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> celebrated any of them, or other holidays, like Passover and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  The children definitely celebrated all of the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I am not -- I can’t remember so clearly exactly how it was, but I know that my parents made sure that June 12, 2006 there was a Seder, that there were Seders, that -- that the other holidays that there were some -- there were some religious observance, so that the children would remember their heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And sad to say I can’t remember who exactly went out to conduct the services, but -- but they were always made very, very much aware that they were Jewish, and where they came from, and what their heritage was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  Do you know if any of the children kept journals?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  No, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We’re trying to find -- pretty late in the game but we’re trying to find children who might remember a-and who can tell us if they kept journals or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I have some inquiries going out now as I’m trying to find children who were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And so far I found one lady who now lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , who was out at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> and she remembers -- she remembers my parents picking them up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> as a group and taking them to classical concerts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Usher Hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Now, I don’t remember that, but when I talked to her she said that she always remembered my parents had taken them to concerts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Were there any negative comments made by non -Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> about harboring these children, taking care of them during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Did you ever sense any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  No, no, I -- I’m trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I didn’t sense anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I was -- I was young myself, but I think that had there been any negative, any negative or -- views June 12, 2006 at all, or any -- any sort of sign of anti-Semitism, that -- that my parents would have been aware of those and -- and they would have spoken among themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And w- we listened to what they said, but no, I didn’t hear anything at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  And then you said when the law came about enemy aliens that the young men 16 and over had to leave, what was that like for these children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  I think they were very unhappy, obviously, that they were in they were th -- classified as enemy aliens, but this was the law of the land. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">In fact, one of my -- one of my uncles -- my mother’s sister married -- married an Austrian before World War I, and he lived in -- he lived in th -- <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> all his life, in fact he was -- he ran one of my father’s businesses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Never thought of taking out citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He’d been there what -- 30 - 40 years or more, and he was classified an enemy alien and he was interned. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So I mean, all of the -- all of the men who were not of British birth and -- and who came from these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , were automatically interned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  Did your parents have any communication or relationship with these children from 16 on, once they left to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  I think they must have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I don’t honestly know, but I think that they must have kept in close contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I can’t see that they wouldn’t have done because they were so -- they were so [indecipherable] of making -- they were so June 12, 2006 involved in making sure that these children knew that they -- they were loved and wanted, and I -- I just can’t see that they would have just let them go like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Now once these 16 year olds and over left, did new children take their <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or was there just less children at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  It was less children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  Do y -- can you tell me a little bit abo -- more about the other staff at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You had mentioned some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Yes, the -- the agricultural side of their education was under the supervision of a Mr. Markham, who was Lord Traprain’s factor. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Now, a factor, the -- the translation of that is the bailiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He was -- he was Lord Traprain’s chief man who did the farming and -- and he took the children, he took the boys especially under his wing and taught them how to -- how to sow crops and do all the things that are necessary in farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">He was a great man and he -- he was -- he was very brusque but very, very kind, and -- and the boys liked him very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And the other members of the staff was of course, Mr. Maxwell, who was the headmaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">There was Miss Lacker, the matron, who was German and who was a lovely lady, very, very -- very warm and compassionate and very competent at what she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  This is a -- she was a German Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  Yes, I’m sorry, yes, she was a German Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">There was Mr. Drew, who was not Jewish, who -- who was the English teacher and who was also the photographer and any of the photographs that we have were taken by him. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We’re not sure of what happened to him after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">There was a Mr. Likelbower from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , who taught Hebrew, who was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">A Miss Trauss, who was German and she was a cook and she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And a Miss Mundy, who was English, who was the school secretary and I doubt that she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I don’t know any of the other members of the staff, but I think that it was a fairly mixed group, partly -- partly Jewish and partly not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  And did they all get along with each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Di -- was there any friction among the staff?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Not as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I think that the ones were hard and came to work with the children were very, very much aware of what had happened, of where the children came from, of how they must be missing their families and I think that they -- that they worked very, very well together, and I think the children appreciated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There were so many cases of home sickness and -- and sadness, and a -- and I think that they tried to help in every way they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Plus, my mother was there, Miss Lacker was there and the Chaim Weitzman’s wife was there, and they knew they June 12, 2006 could go to them and talk to them if there really was -- if there really was a problem and they needed to talk to somebody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  What happened if there was a health problem, if a child needed emergency medical attention?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  I don’t remember that, but I’m quite sure that my parents would have made sure that there was medical facilities there, also close-by that were available for them, because obviously there had to have been some kind of emergencies during -- or health problems during that time, but everything seemed to go smoothly and I think that if there were health -- health problems they had, th-there was medical there -- medical people there to take care of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  Was there a <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span> on the <span class="REGION">property</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  I think there was, I’m not very sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I know that the children were all taught in -- in first aid and what to do if a bomb fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I-I don’t remember seeing a <span class="DLF">bomb shelter</span> myself, but if not then I think that they must have been told where to go in case of -- in case of an air raid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  W-Were there air raids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Oh yes, there were air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We were just -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was only a-a- about 20 miles at the most from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we had air raids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so -- a-and then of course there were <span class="BUILDING">RAF stations</span> -- Royal Air Force stations of -- the bases, I June 12, 2006 think you call them, all around there, so -- and the Germans tried to bomb them, so yes, we had frequent air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And -- I’m sorry -- and -- and of course, a -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had to practice strict blackout. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">All th -- all of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> had to be completely covered at night and a-a-a-at -- the same sort of things that we had to do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  So the staff that you mentioned stayed there at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and were there during the evening and -- and nighttime? </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Who -- or -- or was there another nighttime staff?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Oh no, the staff lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They lived on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">As far [indecipherable] as far as I was concerned -- as far as I can remember, there was no other staff there, I mean, these are the people that were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So they were there with the children during the -- the air raids and the blackouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Absolutely yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And at one time I think that a bomb did fall -- I think my sister was -- was staying there that night and I think that a bomb did fell -- fall on the nearby <span class="BUILDING">air force base</span> and there was quite some consternation, but everything was taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And the children knew, I mean, they knew what was happening, they knew the -- the danger of air raids and [indecipherable] during war time, and after what they’d gone through I think that they were just prepared to do anything that had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  And where did new clothes come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Obviously, if they’d lived there for six years, the children got bigger, heavier, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Whe-Where did they come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  It must have ga -- the clothing must have come from a fund that -- that the -- that- that the Jewish community provided for the running of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I think that -- that the -- the clothing must have been part of it and of course, all of us were under very, very strict clothing rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So, I mean, it was -- 1t was -- it was not so easy to get the clothes that you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I think that we all wore very functional clothing, clothing that would -- the clothing that would last and that ge -- that we could wear for more than one occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So I think that the -- that the children were definitely well-clothed, but there was very, very sensible clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And of course, they all had- as I say -- we all had ration books -- we all had ration books for food and -- and for clothing and for anything, so I mean 1-1-1t was very hard to buy things spontaneously that -- at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  What kind of activities did the children do for recreation there? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">After all, they were still children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  I don’t remember precisely, but I know that they had -- they were divided into various [indecipherable] squads and -- and they had all kinds of games and they had play sessions, they had games. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I’m not sure if-if they played -- if they played British soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I should think that they did, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The girls played hockey, June 12, 2006 but they all seemed to have some kind of very rounded education. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Y1 -- which included sports, and -- and physical education, because these were very, very -- very sensitive years for these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">They were growing fast and they had to have a proper education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Di -- was there any discussion, let’s say your mother or your older sister to the girls who were maturing physically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Yes, I believe that -- and I think that my sister was involved with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I think that -- that the girls would come to my mother, and I -- and to ask for advice, and I think that they could talk to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">She was only two years older than I was, but she seemed to be more mature at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">These are years of which I -- a couple of years can make a great deal of difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So they were there for them, and I think that there were times where some of the children felt that they had a crush on some of the other children and I -- I remember that my mother especially was there to kind of adjudicate what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And it -- it was a community, but 1t was a happy community and the children all lived and thrived and after the war they all went their separate ways, and some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Some, very few, found family and made new lives for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">A-And they all survived, a-and that was the most important thing of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  Were your parents in touch with the other -- the other 33, I guess, children that your father helped to place in different <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Not the Whittingehame children, but --
ANSWER:  No, no, I know, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  -- did your father and mother keep up with those children at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  Well, yes, I mean sa -- mainly because they were part of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I mean, it was a very, very small congregation and 1-1 -- we knew everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I mean, the people who -- who had agreed to take these children in were all -- I wou -- I would almost say some friends of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So we kept in close touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">As I say, I think that our boys had two cousins, th -- and they were in one of my mother’s friend’s <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and this [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I think my aunt -- I believe my aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> took one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And my -- my mother-in-law, as it turned out to be, she took one of them, so they’re all people that we knew and they’re all part of the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Another thing which is nothing to do with these children is that when the refugees came into -- into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> , I think my parents were largely responsible for establishing a refugee club for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And they would -- they would find -- they would rent somewhere, a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> or a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere, and once a week, or so -- twice a week, they could come together and gather and just talk to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And we used to go to <span class="BUILDING">refugee club</span> and talk to them and see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So, June 12, 2006 I mean, apart from the children, they were also trying to help the grownups and just to see that they had some kind -- some kind -- some kind of connection with each other, that they weren't so completely alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  These were adult refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  These wer -- yes, these were adult refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">These were people that had managed to come in -- in fact, my -- one of the people that my father signed an affidavit for was called Dr. Adler and he and his wife came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">One -- another refugee was the Dr. Schneider, who became a very, very good dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">But Dr. Adler became my mother’s physician and you know, my par -- my parents kept -- kept in close touch with them, which is rather interesting thinking about it, cause I’m wondering if they had to sit exams before they could -- if they could practice in- but they definitely did. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And we had refugees come into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And -- and my father was constantly trying to see what he could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">He knew what was happening, he knew what was going on and as time goes by we could see more and more newsreels and stuff of what was happening in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  Di-Did you know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  Yes, we -- yes, we knew about the -- about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I think that we knew more than other people and just agonized about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I mean, we were just so lucky that we had no close family members that were -- that were caught in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I think June 12, 2006 that my parents felt this. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I think they felt that they were so privileged that we escaped this that they wanted to help the people that wer -- that were so unfortunate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  That’s why -- one of the reasons why, a-as an aside, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> -- came to <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , I was so happy that I could work for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and try and keep on the work that my parents were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">It was the one thing I wanted to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  We'll talk about that a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I know with the Kindertransport children, many of them were placed in <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of non-Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Were any of the 35 children that your father helped place, placed in non-Jewish families, or all were placed in Jewish families?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  They were all placed with Jewish families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  I think that a -- I mean, thinking back, my parents were completely involved in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And -- the people that my mother felt that she could contact and ask them, they were Jewish, and then she knew the kind of <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that they would be going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  So it was never necessary to then move out into the -- into the non-Jewish population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  No, I think that -- thinking back on it that if they had they might have been able to bring more -- more children in, but it was a real feat to bring the 35 in, it really was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  And again, could you just go over how your father heard about these 35 children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  I don’t think he heard about them, I think that we knew that -- that -- that there were children being brought in on the Kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We knew that there were thousands being brought in and I think there was a -- there was a plea sent out to all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> , could they take people. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I mean, he had no knowledge of who these children were, but it was just this -- this -- it’s a question, can you help, can you take children. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">That’s what they responded to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Were there any Jewish residents who were negative about this, or was it all a positive response?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  Oh, I’m quite sure that some people said that they would rather not. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I mean, I’m quite sure, I mean I don’t know, but I’m quite sure there was some, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Why do you say that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know, I mean, but thinking back and knowing the nature that June 12, 2006 there’s some people that would and some people that won’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And I -- I just can’t think that everybody that my mother sa -- contacted would say, oh yeah sure, yes of course we’ll do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I’m quite sure there were people that said, hey I’m sorry, we can’t do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  Because of the responsibility, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Is there anything more you can talk about, about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> during °39 to ’45 that we haven’t covered yet, because I wanted to then move on to aft -- you know, when the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Is there anything else that you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Were there any crises that happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  Not that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">No -- I-I think there was a -- a small crisis when -- when some -- some girls said they were heartbroken because they -- they had this crush on one of the boys or something like this, and -- and they’Il be some -- people will go and talk to them and, you know, -- and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Nothing really, nothing really. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I think that it -- it was a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I think that there were ups and downs and I think that obviously -- perhaps some of the children were sick sometimes, but it all worked out, but very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">It was an excellent teaching staff and there were people there like the Chaim Weitzman’s wife, like the Masons or like my parents, who were always there on hand to be there if they were needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  So Vera Weitzman, she didn’t teach any classes, she was just there for suppor -- ma -- emotional support?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  I don’t believe that she taught, no, but she was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And she was very, very -- very enthusiastic about it, and very, very involved with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  And did the children get report cards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  I don’t know, I -- because it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I’m pretty sure that they did, but I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I really don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  And the food came from the -- the <span class="REGION">farm land</span> that -- the surrounding <span class="DLF">farmland</span> that 1t was a part of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  I don’t know where the food came from, I know that -- that 1t was strictly rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I know that all of the -- all of the people [indecipherable] it was strictly kosher and therefore had to come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> from the -- from the Jewish butchers. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I’m sure that -- that the dairy stuff came from the surrounding <span class="DLF">farms</span> , but there again, it was rationed, everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And I -- I know that my father, as I said before, was -- was himself [indecipherable] trying to find extra food for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I mean, h-he was always going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">He wa -- because of the person he was, he knew people and -- and he would go out and say look, there’s a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here, you know, so can’t you help? </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And they would respond to it because they knew what kind of a person he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">In fact, I tell -- in fact I tell a story which 1s co -- June 12, 2006 completely different to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">When we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walkerburn</span> during these two years i-in our <span class="BUILDING">country house</span> , it was a little tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and -- and there was -- and there was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> there, and we used to go visit the nuns, and -- and they were sewing - bless you -- robes for the -- for the Edinburgh bishops. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Anyway, it was terribly cold, it was pitifully cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I mean, and -- and we had no heating at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And they would sit and sew these beautiful, beautiful embroidered gowns and the -- and th- their fingers would be blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And they told us that they were -- they were praying for a miracle to get coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Coal was also rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So we told my father and my father went around, around, and he had two tons of coal delivered to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And they said, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="750">We asked for a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That was my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  How did he get all the, as you say, petrol to keep driving out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">It took a lot of gasoline.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  I don’t know how he got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I know that -- that he had to be very careful because they would -- they would put dye in the petrol so that you know if -- if you -- you had a certain ration, and afterwards if you got <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> petrol, it is -- very often it -- 1t had dye in it so they could tell if 1t was non-kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And -- and I’m not sure how he did it, but -- but he -- I mean, he had ways of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And he’d ask people. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">He’d just go and say, look, you know, we need this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  What did the children call him? </span><span class="sentence" id="760">June 12, 2006
ANSWER:  Do you know, I don’t know? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Possibly Mr. Cohen, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Called my mother Mrs. Cohen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  So now the war is winding down and it sounds to me the -- the negative part was when the young -- young men had to leave to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">But when that happened, did the atmosphere change at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I mean, the -- all these children were enemy aliens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Yes, they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  Were there -- was there any restrictions on the children who remained at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> a -- from that point on, when the older children had to leave -- the older boys had to leave, were there any restrictions or did life go on the same once the boys left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  Well, I think that when they were declared enemy aliens, they were -- they were under much stricter -- they were under a much stricter rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I mean, they couldn’t move around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they couldn’t leave, they had to say where they were this time, but of course, for these children they were -- they were in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , there was nowhere for them to go to, but I think that had they wanted to, that they would have had to sign papers or this sort of thing that, you know, they were enemy aliens, and -- and -- and it -- it -- th-they would have to report if they went anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">But apart from that I think that — that -- you know, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And did we talk about the children who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who were in the different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> coming out to the 30 -- the 35 children coming out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Did they ever do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">ANSWER:  I don’t believe they ever did. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I don’t believe they ever did. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I don’t believe that -- I can’t remember any of the Jewish community really going out of their way to go out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I think that they -- I think that they -- that they -- that the board, the governors of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> used to go out and take their families, but I don’t remember any of the other ones going out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So it was just the staff and the governors and people like that, who had a direct interest going out, but otherwise, the regular Jewish residents did not go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">ANSWER:  No, as far as I know they didn’t and as far as I can remember, I don’t believe that the -- the 33 childr -- or 35 children went out either. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It may -- 1t may have been because of an petrol restriction, I don’t know, but as far -- I don’t remember there ever being any sort of get together with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  So now the war is ending, and then what -- what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Well, the children all went their certain ways, as of say -- the children who found out, sadly, that their families were no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Other went to other people, o-others went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Most of them sa -- went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Some di-did find family, went to join them, a-and -- June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  Were -- were you out there when the children actually heard that the war was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  No, I wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  Do you know if there was any kind of celebration?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  Oh, I think there had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I mean, I remember what it was like for us on -- on V-E Day, and V-J Day and I mean, it was sheer jubilation, and I think -- I think that- my own feeling was that, well of course there was -- there was rejoicing, there was also a lot of fear and uncertainty what will -- what’s going to happen to us now. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I mean -- I mean, there had to have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I mean they had -- they’d been there for what, five or six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">They had some kind of -- the security feeling that here were their ties, here was a basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">All of a sudden they were going to go out on their own again.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  --- wasn’t that -- so they’re now 20 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Yes, yes, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I mean, it was six years for us, I mean, the war was six years and of course the -- they were young adults by the time they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Which was -- I mean, which was good, I mean, it had had this time to -- to grow up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> that was very, very safe and solid and wherever they went to, they June 12, 2006 had a good back -- had had a good background, you know, and -- and I’m quite sure that the people that taught them were very, very -- very, very careful to make sure that they had something to fall back on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  Were you there when any representatives from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> came over to try to encourage these young people to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  No, I wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I think though that -- I don’t think they had to encourage them, I think that the children that found out that their families were no longer alive, didn’t have much -- or, I mean, 1-it sounds bad to say, didn’t have any alternative, but th- they were lost, I mean, and they thought that th-there was a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for them in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">It was obviously the best thing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Hilda Seftor. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">This is tape two, side B.

ANSWER:  No, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I think that some of them had written to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and hoped and hoped and waited and waited and I think -- I believe I remember that some of them got the envelopes back saying that -- that their parents were no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">But I don’t know -- you know, this is the only thi-thing that I do know. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">It -- it was a very, very hard time for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">QUESTION:  Does it bring back memories of the children that you met in -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> and the other boys, the -- Agon and Max? </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I mean, does it stimulate your memories when you go there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">ANSWER:  Oh yes, of course it does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I mean, I see children in these photographs, they look so much like the children that were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> , so -- so much like Max and Agon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Do you have a lot of contact with the other volunteers at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  No, I think that what I -- the work that I’ve been doing has always been kind of something that I’ve done by myself and I really have no contact with the other volunteers at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">In fact, I don’t think I don’t think I know any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I have -- I June 12, 2006 have gone to the appreciation nights 1n the past, but I don’t go any more and I don’t go to the dinners, and I’m perfectly happy not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I think I’m just happy to do what I’ve done, you know, and I know the other volunteers are a community in themselves and they know each other and that’s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">One of the things I do, and I try to do every year, 1s I go down on Holocaust Remembrance dray -- day, and I read names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And I’ve done this every year.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Yeah, the names of the victims and sometimes they’re very, very hard to read, they -- you know, Polish or Czechoslovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">This year I went down and they gave me a choice and I chose names that were from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , and they were easier to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">But I mean, each one of them is a heartbreak, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">You -- you read these names and you see families, you see whole groups of names and you see ages from the grandfather to the little children just months old, and it has to tear out your heart to know that they all -- they all perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">QUESTION:  Did you ever go back to visit in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">ANSWER:  I’ve been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> three, perhaps four times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">We wouldn’t leave our children when they were growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">The first time my husband and I went back to visit was in 1973 on our 25" anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And my husband and I went back, I think twice after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And then I went back ba -- by myself about nine years ago to visit June 12, 2006 my cousin, who has a fa -- who had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And then the last time I went to visit was with my son, two years after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And I don’t think Pll go back again.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">ANSWER:  Yes, I do feel Scottish, yes I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I mean, I -- I guess -- when I go over there people say that I talk with an American accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Here they say I talk with a Scottish accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">But there’s something very, very Scottish about me, and I love to hear the bagpipes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I get so homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And a -- a funny story that I will tell you is that a friend of mine told me that she had a friend who plays the bagpipes in the American Air Force Bagpipe Band, of all things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And she said, he would like to meet you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So she brought him here one evening, with his bagpipes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Now this is a -- this is a <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> association and -- and -- and there are neighbors on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">He brought out his bagpipes and started to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Now, you know how loud they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">My -- my son at the time was the president of the homeowner’s association. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I could see him literally getting paler by the minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">But it was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I mean, I mean I can have tears in my eyes when I hear the bagpipes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">It brings back so much to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I absolutely love it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">June 12, 2006
QUESTION:  Is there anything else you’d want to add before we end? </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Any thoughts that you have, whether the world has learned from the Holocaust or anything that you care to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I honestly don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I was left with a feeling of antagonism bu - towards anything German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I didn’t want to know German people or anything like this, but in the last few years I -- I have two very good friends who are German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">One very, very dear friend who is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I realized that there are good people everywhere, and that -- and one can’t judge people by their nationality, by their race or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I mean, I feel that -- that what is going on now i-in the world is deeply upsetting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">You know, you see anti-Semitism everywhere, you see racism everywhere, and I don’t think that -- I don’t think it will ever be any -- any better, and that’s what really bothers me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">QUESTION:  Well, it’s wonderful that you continued to work and to document these people’s history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">That’s wonder -- wonderful that you do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">ANSWER:  Well, you know, we’re all getting so much older, the survivors and myself, we’re getting very much older and it’s so good to know that anything that we can say now might live on and that people can perhaps listen to it and hear what it was like during these year, and -- and for me myself, my -- my prime reason for doing this is so that people would get to know what my parents did, how much they cared, how June 12, 2006 much they agonized over what was happening in Europe and how much they wanted to help and how much they did help in a very, very quiet way, but they -- they gave everything that they could and I think that this should be remembered.</span></p>

You had mentioned something previously about a menorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Can you tell me about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">ANSWER:  Yes, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> , my parents loved being there and they were very, very surprised when they were invited to go out one special evening and they -- because they didn’t usually get an invitation, we went out and that was fine and they -- the staff said no [indecipherable] come out tonight, could you possibly come, and we said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So we came out and -- and -- and I’m not sure how many of this -- of the children were there, if they were all there or not, I don’t remember that, but one of them got up and made a speech and said that they had worked on something very special as a gift for my parents and they were going to present it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And the brought out this absolutely beautiful menorah that they had carved by themselves and written in Hebrew on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">It was about three foot across, and -- and made of beautiful wood, and they said that they would like us to have it and -- in appreciation for all that we had done for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Well, we took -- my par -- my father was a very quiet man who wa -- had a very soft heart and when he’s touched and the tears came to his eyes, and he said something appropriate, I’m not sure what he June 12, 2006 said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">But we took it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we used it every year and it was on our -- on our sideboard at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every year that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Then I was the first of the family to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and when I left my mother was still alive, and there was the menorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And then after that my sister left and the last person to leave was my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And we didn’t know, evidently he brought everything he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And he is no longer alive, but his wife lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> -- very, very fond of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And about three months ago she called me and said she was cleaning up her <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> and she said that she found this wooden thing in the corner, would I know what it was and would I be interested in it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And she expl -- she described it and I said, oh my God, Pat, I said that’s the menorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And I said, don’t -- don’t get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">I said, would you consider giving it to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And she said, well, she said, I don’t see why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">She says, Pll ask my two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">One of them is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> just now, one of them was with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">So she asked her two children, Mandy and David and they said -- they didn’t know much about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , but they s -- and I said, you know what, I’m going to send you some information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">So I sent them all the pamphlets, all the documents I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And she said, yes, of course we'll give it to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And she said, if it’s all right with you, I'll donate it with David and Mandy’s names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">So the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ’s -- a <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> group came out to her very early one morning, they packed it up, they brought it back here and it is June 12, 2006 now in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And -- and it really does my heart good to know that it’s there and that something that was given to my parents will always be there for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  That’s wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">W-When did your mother pass away”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">ANSWER:  My mother passed away in April sum -- 1951, six weeks after I arrived in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">She had a stroke and died the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And I -- broke my heart and -- and- and we had just come over here and I was arranging to take my son, Lawrence, who was two years old back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And -- and then -- and we went through all of the things about getting permits and things and then I suddenly realized, they can’t hold a funeral, she’s already gone, what’s the point of going back? </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">So I didn’t go back for over 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">But she was a lovely person, and as I say, she -- she was so upset when we left, and you know, perhaps it was best that it happened that way because had she lived she would have been -- you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">QUESTION:  You had mentioned a little bit before about your feelings about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I w- wanted to know what your feelings about being Jewish were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">I mean, here you all helped to take care of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Do you think -- during the war years -- do you think that m-made an impression on your Jewishness? </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Did it make you feel more Jewish or did it not have any effect on that aspect of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1111">ANSWER:  Oh, I think it definitely made me more aware of who I was an-and -- and -- and of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">We ourselves didn’t encounter any -- any animosity or any anti- June 12, 2006 Semitism, but coming over here I realized that there were -- that there was more anti-Semitism over in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> than I’d realized, and that people were not so - so willing to wear a Mogen David, or wear some -- something to show that they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And I found it -- 1t’s a much more open society here when I came over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So while we had -- we had absolutely no -- no sort of contact with anything that made us feel that w-we were unwelcome or anything, I know that there was that there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And we were very, very -- I mean, we were very, very proud of being Jewish, and as I say, we were the only Jewish children, the five of us, in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and -- and we felt kind of important because of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">You know, I mean, there was -- there was no feeling of bias or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But it did happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  What forms did it take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  Oh, I -- I think it -- 1t was -- 1t was covert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I think that the kind of people that my parents were also, I think people would hesitate to -- to do anything to them because they were such kind people and they were always helping other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I mean, I talk about refugees -- the refugees, I talk about the Kindertransport, I talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Whittingehame</span> , but there were so many other people that they helped in every way they could, I mean, they were just kind, kind people that -- that just were always out for other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And I think that being a sort of a fairly small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in a way, that people were aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> is a much bigger and more of a cosmopolitan June 12, 2006 town than it is -- than 1t was when I lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">There was no trans-Atlantic flights, there were no tourists there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">It was a very, very quiet <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">It was all -- it was almost a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sleepy city</span> , not like it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And - and my father knew the mayor, and in fact the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we had, and actually we leased it during the war, it was bought after we left by the [indecipherable] of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So I mean, he sort of knew people and he -- and he felt very comfortable with them, and so I don’t -- so if there was any anti-Semitism, we didn’t see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">But I -- I think sometimes that while it’s not always the case, that it’s the kind of person you are also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">That may be wrong, but --
QUESTION:  Have you shared this story about what your parents did during the war, with other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Do you -- does it something that comes easily to you and that you share with a lot of other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">ANSWER:  Yes, I do, particularly now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Particularly now as I’m getting older and -- and that the survivors don’t have that much longer, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">But I am so, so anxious that people do hear about my parents, do know that they did something good, and -- and- and helped other people that I do go out of my way, I go out of my way that you - in ways that I would not have thought years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I am a member of -- of a club on the internet, a lovely club, I’ve been a member now for about five, six years, and it started off as a book club and I’m the only Jewish person and I bring out all the time about being Jewish, about the Jewish holidays, and in particular about this -- about June 12, 2006 Whittingehame, about the Kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">They are now so interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And they will -- they will tell their children and they will tell their friends and this 1s how I feel that people get to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I mean, I -- it’s not myself I want to talk about, it’s the fact that I had so -- such wonderful -- such a wonderful example, you know, and- my own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">It’s funny because my oldest son always used to say to me -- he resented the fact that we came over here and that he’s got no family over here, because he knew that my mother was one of eight children, and that we had a very, very big family group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And I said, but this is what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And I said, after the war, everybody kind of separated anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">But he said to me, what was it like for you growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And I sat down and wrote him 10 pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And he said to me, it’s like a fairy tale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And I said, this is how it was, it was a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And I want -- and I wanted to sh -- and -- and my -- and I said to him do me a favor and copy to send it to your other brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I want them to know and I want them to tell their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And ma -- basically about being Jewish and living in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish household</span> , and -- and -- and being members of an -- of a community, about sort of going to the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , going to services every Saturday morning.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">ANSWER:  Yes, they have changed and this is a funny thing is that my husband ha-had never been terribly involved with things that I’ve been interested in, as in going to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I mean, he supported me, but this was my thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But -- and his parents did take a refu -- one of the 35 children and I hate to say this, but I th -- I have a feeling that my mother-in-law treated this little girl more of a domestic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">But June 12, 2006 anyway, the thing was this, that we went to -- we went to Europe in the 1980’s, and we went through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and -- and the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and got to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , and then we drove to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And it’s a beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> , a- and we could see -- and we could see a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> 1n the distance, and I said, let’s go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">He said, I can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And I said, come on Jerry, it’s just another <span class="DLF">border</span> , let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">He said, I’m sorry Hilda, I just can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">A-And he wouldn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So I mean, he had much deeper feelings than he’d ever, ever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">But yes, my feelings about sort of, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , have changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I don’t know -- I have mixed feelings about it because in one of Leon Yuris’s books, he tries to explain this make-up of a German, the physiology and all [indecipherable] and I believed him -- him completely, but as I say, I’ve been in contact with couple of people recently, and one in particular, and they are lovely people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And I feel that you can’t label everybody the way I once did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And I have a friend whose mother was German and she’s no longer alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Every time I saw her, she’d be apologizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And I -- and she I think lived in somewhere like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> or something that was terribly badly bombed and they went out sort of looking for pot -- sort of scraping for potatoes, they were so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">She was telling me all this [indecipherable] she says, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And I say, look, you can’t go back and -- and -- everybody had problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">But I think it made me realize that -- I mean I-- myself, I could never understand -- I could never June 12, 2006 understand how the German people could not see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">How they couldn't see that the -- their neighbors were all disappearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I mean, this could never be explained to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">But it’s a new generation and I think that the <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> , that they’re bending over backwards to teach the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And I -- they say at one time the Japanese were taking this whole thing out of their -- out of the history books, it just didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">But the Germans are bending over backwards to make sure that they understand what -- what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And of course they still have their -- their anti-Semites, and th -- and their -- their Nazis with their -- with their armbands on, but listen, we all have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I mean, look what’s happening here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">So I think that hopefully -- hopefully this will never happen again and I feel that this new German generation 1s different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I can only hope so.</span></p>
