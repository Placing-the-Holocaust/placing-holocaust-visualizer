<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell us your full name and your date of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Joseph B. Maier M-A-I-E-R. I was born on January 24, 1911. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was raised and schooled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latski</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">What else would you like to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  A little bit about your family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what happened to you in 1933?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Now, my family -- that's an interesting question, had left already. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My father left as a matter of fact in the mid 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He was an orthodox rabbi, had a lot of wanderlust, landed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My mother followed shortly thereafter with my youngest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">In 1930, let me see, three brothers and two sisters followed them, joined them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I remained behind because I wanted to finish my <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> schooling in . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But one year later, in 1931, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on a student visiting Visa, but in 1932 I was again back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Latski</span> because I figured after all Hintenberg defeated Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was president and things would not go much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">On the contrary I would be there to defend the republic you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I honestly felt I would have a chance, not only to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , especially since I was very fortunate to have obtained a fellowship from Shotten Foundation to study philosophy, sociology and comparative literature at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I honestly felt I would have an opportunity to defend the Wiemer republic against its mortal enemy, the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And I could make my contribution in that direction, either as an intellectual, a young intellectual or as a fighter even. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I loved that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I didn't want to abandon it to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I would do my very level best in order to defend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">If there were, as I had hoped there would be, enough allies who felt as faithful to the Wiemer republic as I did at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Does that answer your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  In that very first year -- I remember you asked me what I did in '33. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Well, it came '33 on January 1, -- I remember to this day, in January 1, 1933 I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , the University Clinic of the University of recovering from an appendectomy when in the afternoon the Fuhrer's voice bellowed over the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I remember to this day what a shock this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The nurse came in in order to attend to me, but I was profoundly disturbed when I heard Hitler's voice confirming what I had feared, namely that Hintenberg backed by the army and the conservatives had made Hitler chancellor of the reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I had the dark feeling that dark times were going to befall not only <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but the world, and that my own days in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were about to end. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">By the time I returned for the last of my three semesters at the University of by that time that is by the time I returned which was in the spring, Hitler had already started the Nazification of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with a breathtaking reptitivty. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">His coming as I said to power January 1, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">In February the reichstag was set on fire at the instigation of Goering and Guthers, in March something else -- the so called enabling act was passed which I don't know whether you know what the enabling act means, it made Hitler practically the dictator of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> enabling him that is to say an his cabinet to pass legislation which would practically lead to the destruction of the Wiemer republic to the rearmament of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to the ending of the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and April, March came the -- if I remember correctly came the book burnings at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">On April 1, was the boycott anti-Jewish boycott which led to the looting of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and the beating and arrests of the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and transferring them either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo prisons</span> if not to their early deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">These were things that were happening by the time I returned to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">By July, when the semester had come to an end I woke up and I wrote back to my parents who had been of course concerned since Hitler's assent to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">This time, right know, I'm anxious to join you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I've had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I'm in fear of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Please help me and send me the affidavit and the boat ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I want to leave as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">By September the Nazification had progressed further and I knew that Hitler had in the meantime had succeeded in abolishing all parties except his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That the rearmament of the Nazis in the violation of the Versailles Treaty and the deception by wealth and stealth was going to proceed without any inhibitions by domestic certainly not domestic or from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">On September, in deed, 1933, in September 1933 I left and eventually landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and joined my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Can you tell me then what the professional route was that brought you from there, and we'll try to do it fairly briefly that brought you then to the role that you have in interrogation and intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I know it's a big jump.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Well, I'll tell you very quickly what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">From 1933, September 1933 when I landed here, from practically 1939 I was a student at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> where I earned my masters and ph.d degrees, while also working as a research associate at the Institute of Social Research with all the principals of the so called Frankfort School of Sociology, Social Science, including Max , Herbert , , Henry Grossman, Franz Nuemen, and a number of other people, but the principals were actually, the principal figures were and Fran. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Fran not so much among the principals but the first three were. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I was a research assistant there, very happy there because this was an intellectual hothouse . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was at the time when the luminaries of the American Academy were still at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I still knew and learned a great deal and admired a great deal John Dewy. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">For my money still <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 's philosopher. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The American philosopher, most represented American philosopher. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And the other luminaries would be very much true of this generation of Americans any more, perhaps they do, but I don't think I need mention them here. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">That's an important date, to alice Newman in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I became a father of my only child, my daughter Doris, in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">In 1939 I became the research assistant more exclusive research assistant to Adoni with the Princeton radio research project. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">From 1940 to 1943 I was an assistant editor of , the German Jewish New York weekly newspaper where I was by at the time the only American citizen and responsible for all the English language pages and columns as well as for the Jewish political and religious and learned subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">From 1944 to 1943 I was propaganda analyst for the United States Office of War Information in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">From D-Day until after VJ Day I was propaganda analyst for the Office of War Information, <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but more especially attached with a small group of American officers to the hush-hush BBC monitoring service located at near Reading with a special duty of writing the so-called report about what the German people were allowed to read and hear by the government of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in the theaters of war for the commanders in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , that is the report had to be written for the commanders in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and the policy makers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Let me say for one thing before I come to VJ day. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">For all that we won, and we too, that is the secret weapons that the Nazis unleased onto the <span class="REGION">British Isles</span> , the heightened sense and enhanced sense of living I have never experienced before or after. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">As I think about it as I try to recollect the war time days, my war time days in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> were among the happiest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I made also on my days off, good friendships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> and found very much to be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the cloistered world of the <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I never considered any other <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> as free and so much a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as the <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">That's why I spent my life eventually as an academic at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> after the war and after the trials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I was determined though all along and I so wrote to my wife in the hundreds of letters which she all saved, hundreds of letters which she all saved from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> during the war, even before it was sure, that is in the middle-- let's see D-Day was in '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">In '44 I wrote I'm thinking about what we have to do the day the war ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I'm determined in having a hand in the rebuilding of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in the punishing of the war criminals but in salvaging the best of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in building of the foundations of a just and lasting peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I'm interested in spite of what I've learned about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidonek</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> , in spite of it and because of it I'm determined to see that the criminals are punished, that justice 1s meeted out not at the price of sacrificing millions of innocent women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Precisely because I remember what was done and what feelings dominate those who have suffered under Nazi terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I wanted to save then and I want to save the world from any boomerang effects of a wrong policy of treating wrongly the defeated enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But I said to my wife, we have to remember that for our own sake, if not for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's sake we must lay the foundation for just and proper forms of democratic life so that the Germans become an essential constituent of a sound economy and a sound Europe at least in the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now, I hope you'll share my opinion, I said to my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My wife wrote me even more than several hundred letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">She wrote me every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I couldn't write every day, so she probably wrote a hundred more letters than I did myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I wanted to know all about our baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I wanted to know all about herself, and I wanted to reassure her that I would do nothing without her approval, because it's a joint life that we have to live for whatever life will be granted to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Can I ask you a question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yes, by all means do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Between say the later part of '42 and this period where you're looking toward the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">What was your sense of the news that was coming about, say the messengers about the exterminating policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">People like Yankarsky (ph) who came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Were you aware of that kind of news or by the time you were with the Office of War Information in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , what was the atmosphere of knowledge about the policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  I tell you, as I recollect now, I first didn't want to believe it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I didn't want to believe -- I knew that the Nazis were our mortal enemy, but I could not for the life of me believe that they would descend to the depths of bestiality and barbarity to which they actually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I didn't want to believe the first report. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I said I've lived with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I hate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I want to bring them down to their knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I want to destroy the whole damn Nazi structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I want to punish every one of the killers involved, every one of them, and I felt that I had a strong mission to do just that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">For all that, I couldn't believe about any reports that there were by that time, about what was involved in the ,what had taken place in the conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I couldn't bring myself to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">As a matter of fact Aurandt and I both formulated against in our respective columns in . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There is such a thing as a project going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and there are by now several books about what German writers abroad, that is outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were writing about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And somebody writing a dissertation about discovered that Joe Maier, that is myself and Hanna Aurandt were among those people, but especially Joe Maier as a responsible editorial person in for writing fairly about the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Writing fairly about the new Americans that is to which he belonged to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Writing fairly about what is happening and ought to happen and what the Jews had in mind and deserved to have as they were dreaming of returning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They testified, in other words let me put it as simply as possible, that Joe Maier was, that is myself, was not only a good German, a good ex-German, if you want to put it, and fair, he was also a good American. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He was also a good Jew and a good zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Gosh, I committed no sins in their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That's what I read now. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And they quote me verbatim. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">When I saw the first dissertation quotations you know about this an old gentleman was writing the dissertation about the history of during this war time period in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , I said I had no idea I was as virtuous as all that and I had written as cleverly as all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I had forgotten about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Were you still at at the time of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  No, no, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> already from '44 -- you know, from '44 to D day until after VJ day, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">In the meantime, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> had happened. '</span><span class="sentence" id="112">43 it had happened, and that was about the time when I landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">OWI</span> , that I began to believe the incredible, what I considered was incredible, that it was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">That it was all true, that all these <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , <span class="BUILDING">extermination factories</span> and <span class="BUILDING">corpse factories</span> did exist that the Nazis did what I thought was impossible or incredible to do for anybody certainly not for my civilized fellow ex-Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">That was a profound shock, and that of course made a whole lot of difference in my feelings, but I never, even thereafter, waiver as I said before, in what my duty was. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I wasn't going to emulate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I wasn't going to exact retribution for retribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was interested in <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , not in bringing down the rest of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Not in poisoning the rest of the world for all times to come, but for building a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">During that period, that is during the period of our invasion of Europe and the beginning of our victory in Europe, I received a letter from my brother, who was in the <span class="BUILDING">CBI theater</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> Burma India theater, and had learned from my wife who kept everybody in the family informed and sent them excerpts of Joe's letters, my letters that he thoroughly approved of what I wanted to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , go back and help in the rebuilding and lay the foundation for a just and lasting peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He would like to be a part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He thought we were real people with vision and courage to do that sort of thing and he hoped that Alice, my wife, would be a party with us to do that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  So when did you set foot back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what did you find?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Well, I have to tell you first what happened when I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> first after VJ day. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I insisted to my superiors that I had to touch base at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before I accepted any job assignments in <span class="REGION">occupied Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I'm absolutely willing and determined to accept such jobs, but I have to touch base. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I have to see my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I have to see my little daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That I must do first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Make sure that they are alive and well. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">A few weeks after I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to a great hello and all the embraces that I dearly needed, I was in the employ of the war department as it was then called still. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">As a matter of fact, I had to and was invited to show up for an interview at the <span class="BUILDING">pentagon</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> by a Colonel Dustair who was interviewing the right kind of people to function as simultaneous interpreters at the forthcoming Nuremberg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I thought I was the man for the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">As I think I told you before, I speak several languages, but I dream I curse and I pray in only two, German and English absolutely perfectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">There isn't a word that I can miss and not a nuance I would miss. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I thought I was the man for the job and Colonel Dustair, a good guy, he thought that was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I was the man for the job and he hired me on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Shortly thereafter, I was in uniform and back on <span class="REGION">German soil</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> amidst a heap of rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In one damaged <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> to be our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> I think it was called Adlog where all the American personnel -- not American personnel, the American Chief of Council personnel were located. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Eventually, I was assigned another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was a heap of rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="141"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had been completely destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Only a few <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and in the surroundings suitable for ourselves were left standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">It was a depressing sight but I was elated at the thought that I would get through the job eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The trial had not yet begun. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The strange thing was that on the spots -- but what had begun were the pretrial interrogations. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The preparation of the cases before the international military ruler by allied personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Allied personnel meant for me practically only American personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I wasn't surrounded by anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">On the spot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I wanted to say, when it came to the assignment of actual job interpretation jobs, low and behold Colonel Dustair preferred for the prize interrogation for the prize interpretation jobs at the integrations regular army officers instead of lowly academic intellectual like myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I was profoundly miffed I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I said if I can't have the real job for which I'm qualified I was absolutely certain and which he agree on I was, then I didn't want the job at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Then I wanted to be assigned to the analysis section of the interrogation division, which I was eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Much to Colonel Dustair's reluctance but to my own satisfaction I was much happier and much more appreciated in the analysis section of the Interrogation Division of which I eventually became the chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Now, you wanted to know when I finally got to interrogate Herz and to the document I turned over to ;
QUESTION:  If you would explain a little bit about your nature of the task as an interrogator?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, gladly. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">As a member of the analysis section of the interrogation division I now actually had a chance to both analysis the materials that were disclosed in the course of the interrogations by any of the officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I got the verbatim transcripts of --that is copies of the transcripts of the interrogations but also to participate in the interrogation and interpretation job myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My main job though, and I liked that of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That was up my alley really, and this is how I finally got to interrogate Rudolph Herz the culprit whose confession I gave to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But I was not a principle interrogator not even of Herz. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I attended a good many of the interrogations. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">As a matter of fact, I attended most of the interrogations conducted by my colleague Alfred Boothe. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">All in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Some of the copies of the transcript you have in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> collection which I turned over to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">All of these interrogations by Alfred Boothe were attended to only by the young lady stenographer, Alfred Boothe and sometimes myself, sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was during one of the -- all in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We didn't have anybody else present, and most of these interrogations were concerned a) with the confirmations earlier of which he made earlier, to all sundry, including my boss's my immediate superiors in the Interrogation Division, that is the chief of the Interrogation Division, Colonel Ahmen, and my immediate superior Colonel Burkhardt. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Substantively and substantially the confession he had made several times in earlier interrogations, but all the interrogations that were conducted by Alfred Boothe and myself were conducted in German only with nobody else present but the two of us and mostly Boothe himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And they were concerned almost exclusively only occasionally with the repetition of the confession making sure he was still testifying under oath, but mostly concerned as I said with his, that is Herz's relations and conversations with the poison gas industrialists with whom he was dealing in the extermination of our people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was during one of these latter interrogations that it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn't seen in isolation the straightforward in one sentence confession I Rudoloph Herz during my term of office as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> put so and so many Jews or had so many Jews put to death by gassing so and so by other means which I then had signed and sworn to before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That was the only occasion that I extracted an without much ado. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Substantively let me repeat again, substantially in other interrogations by the four named superior officers of mine, Colonel Airman and Colonel Burkhardt that made the same statements against substantively, confessed too much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">As a matter of fact, most of the other statements involving other people and other personnel he had made in front of my larger groups than my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I was interested in this unique statement on a piece of paper let's see how -- I have to tell you one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">When I left after the interrogation of Herz, I felt positively ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and vomit, and that happened more than once. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">That didn't cease, but I wouldn't let on. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I showed the same straight forward face. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I wouldn't let the enemy see my face that I was moved that I conducted myself other than a straight American officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Can you describe him, what kind of impression he made on you personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  I tell you, that is not to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">To me personally, who had dreamed of this kind of a job, that I would have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I1 would force myself to do it, that I would face the deviling carnage. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I had to discover that the devil doesn't look like a devil. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The devil looks like a little man, which he portrayed himself as to a miserable creature who once he's rid of his power and glory and the whole aura that surrounds such people in power. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Once they're bereft of the uniform, once they're bereft of their familiar environment, they are absolutely mediocre, familiar kind of little man, about the little, little man who portrays himself about a good father, a good family man, a good husband, who does nothing but his duty and he things of nothing but his duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And even when he had horrible things, admittedly he had horrible things to do, difficult tasks, he called them, difficult tasks to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He didn't enjoy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It once occurred to me and Senator Jewry who did most of the interrogation of Herz and we had written all these articles together Senator Jewry and I which were published in the --oh I did have to tell you that separately, which were published in Jewish Journal, the New York Post, a whole lot of articles. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">If you're interested I'll tell you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They insisted on they were mere executive organs. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Nothing ever was done on their own initiative. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Executive organs of the Fuhrer. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That's sheer executors of the categorical imperative of their superiors. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Their superior being in the last instance the Fuhrer himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Everyone of them as a matter of fact, including the military with the one sole exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">On occasion, Goering himself would admit he had actually signed the order and he felt he was responsible for order whatever the order was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Wasn't Goering skeptical about how they could have killed so many people at such a rate at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Oh, he was skeptical, he had no idea about what was going on, the detail he denied knowing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They all denied knowing the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">As a matter of fact, 1t turned out that the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> commandants and those responsible for this variously either exaggerated, probably exaggerated and exaggerated the numbers that occurred in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> compared to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But Herz prided himself in conferences other concentration commandants of being able to accommodate and being anxious what he called , accommodating more of his victims than any of the others, and they were vying with one another who could kill more people at one full swoop than the others and more cheaply, more efficiently. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Herz was the winner of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  So, can you give me some more impressions of Herz the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I want to say since this man is signing a piece of paper to you that says he 1s responsible for the gassing of two and a half million people, is there any emotion in that for him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  No, he made a factual statement which he had wrote a factual statement which in fact he testified to earlier several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">There was no emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It was what he called a hard duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He took no pleasure from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He derived no pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I said didn't you have fun doing that? </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I wanted to test him and see whether he was a sadist. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He was no sadist. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He was perfectly normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">He was doing his duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I really believe he was doing his duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He was doing his duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He considered that his duty, and he shut his eyes to the abnormality of this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">To the incredible abyss to which human beings can descend in order to perform duties of that sort to which performance I think a normal person would revolt, rather than dying himself than do it himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I always I figured I would rather commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I'd die fighting against the Nazis than do anything at their behalf. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The slightest favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I have to tell you something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I have to tell you also that I was among those who were furious about those who helped among the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> who did the listing and who did the helping and who did all the helper services, the so called kapos for the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I was absolutely furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I said how can you do this to your own families, to your own men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Old men, young children and women, I said helpless as they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I was absolutely furious and I couldn't believe -- I didn't want to believe at first that Nazis would be able to do it, but this man did it and thought it was his odd duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  Did he explain it, the duty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Never in any other terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Never in any other terms that this was a hard task. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">That he was told about that it would cost him a great deal of psychological energy and strength, but he had to do it for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he had to do it for the Fuhrer, and there was nothing, I was finally convinced that he would not do, that he would not do for the Fuhrer. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Absolutely nothing, but what he did do was more than anybody could imagine anybody able to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">He insisted he was a small cog of a huge machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He had nothing to do with initiating, nothing he did on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He did not permit himself to feel any pity in the face of the hard duty to perform, which would elevate and guarantee the rise to last for a thousand years. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Unspeakable glory, unheard of glory would come to the rise and to those who had helped to defeat international Jewry and international capitalism and international bureaucracy, and of course enemies of the rise, who are all in the service of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  Did he talk about the responsible of others, Eichman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  Well, he only to those from whom he received his direct orders, and the chief of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> the <span class="BUILDING">head office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was was one of the chiefs and he had other sub chiefs there in their high security head office, but he never questioned their authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">He was invited to a report never to initiate any drastic steps but always to report such steps including the ones at the conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  He was commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sauxenhausen</span> wasn't he at the time of the ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">You could be right about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I concentrated mainly on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">To me that was the most heinous <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the most dreadful of <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The one <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I wish would never exist and would disappear and only leave the memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The memory must be preserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The memory must never die. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The memory must never die, otherwise I don't care much about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but the memory must not die of what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">That's why it may be necessary to mark the <span class="NPIP">place</span> on the spot, too, this is where it actually happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  You were in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with him and only two other people, that's a fairly intimate situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  What kind of exchanges happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  As I said, we had orders to conduct ourselves as American officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I considered that a sacred duty I might say, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I always stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I never fell out of <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">At the interrogation of one , where I was the interpreter as well as the interrogator, there was short interruption in the interrogation and I shouted at who was the immediate superior of Herz's . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I really shouted and I roared and Colonel Burkhardt turned around and said, "What's going on Joe?" </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I said, oh, I just forgot myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">He tried to lie through his teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He denied something that he had said before that I interpreted earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I shut him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">That's the only time that I lost my proper cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Otherwise I tried to keep myself cool.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  You must have had feelings of revenge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I had to suppress them, but the only relief I found usually afterwards that's the only time I had a chance to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and vomit. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I was sick for half an hour and tried to recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I said an American officer mustn't show his weakness in front of the culprit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Was he going through details of what happened in the process in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Oh, we interrogated him and questioned him about all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Oh yes, in great detail, in great detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Who was involved in what. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Who was involved, then what happened, with whom, at whose charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Who was present, whose order. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">When did this happen, that happen, all the details where he was queried about. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Anything that we can thing about that we could read about we asked him about. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Senator Jourey the colleague with whom I wrote the articles when we returned in '46 right after the war for the New York Post and for the big book thereafter and for the Jewish Morning Journal, which had to be translated from my German into their Yiddish, he did most of the interrogating. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He was the one who really squeezed the juice out of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Tried to get the most out of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I didn't have the strength or the nerve to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I know I was going to feel ill and I had to stop and get out and vomit first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  You mentioned that he talked while you were about the relationship he had with some of the chemical firms that supplied --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Can you tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">He was quite proud of his set up wasn't he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  No, he was -- let me say this. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We tried the interrogators, the interrogators in the interrogation division, mostly my colleague Senator Joury tried to squeeze him as much as possible and especially then afterwards in the intimacy of the just the twosome or threesome with Alfred Boothe, who were the individuals, what's their names of the gas industrialists, when did you advise them of their task. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Did they ever ask what you needed the gas for? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They didn't especially ask me but they must have known they admitted they must have known for what purposes was because it was in the vicinity and anybody knew about this and everybody knew what it was being used for. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The industrialists themselves who denied involvement could never been shown to have been actually been asked that they were told by the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> commandants that they were used for the gassing the culprits but it was clear on the face of it that they knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They must have known about it because everybody else did know about it, and the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> smokes and everybody knew what the fires were about. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">What the smoke was from. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">This was no child's play going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">This was no fire festival of any sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">No fireworks, everybody knew what the smoke signaled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  There were competitive bids by the chemical firms weren't there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  There were. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">There were two <span class="BUILDING">chemical firms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">IG was involved one time and there's a Hamburg firm that was involved at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">You have it all as I've written it in my articles there. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I'm much more specific on the basis of the documents and of my immediate recollection of the interrogations. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Who was involved, what <span class="BUILDING">firms</span> , -- since I was going to publish I was going to be pretty sure that I can't be sued for libel. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I knew what I was talking about and had the testimony at my fingertips and my clear recollection at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">There couldn't be any doubt about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Right now, I'm an old gent, I tried to be an old turk. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Are there some other defendants at the trial who made a big impression on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  I must say the whole lot of them with one exception made the same impression on me, a very said and drab impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The one exception because he had an extraordinary 1.Q. was , the former president. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He had a very good 1.Q. yes, but you know what the strange thing 1s, he wanted to be interrogated as he was eventually by a Colonel who eventually became a U.S. District Court Justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He was up on economics and he wanted to be interrogated on his economic brilliance and specialties and all that sort and insisted on having an interrogator to whom he could really disclose what his contribution was to both the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> up and the undermining boring from within of the Nazi government until he was booted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">The only man with a superior 1.Q. who impressed me as such sat there in the dark of the open military tribune asked by a mistake on our part, he was associated with the wrong kind of club. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He said as if the whole thing didn't concern him, just this motley crew over there, rightly so, rightly so, but I associated with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He was acquitted eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I saw him on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> subsequently to. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I didn't want to talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I didn't want to give him the satisfaction that he got off without punishment because he had also helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He was early,-- he belonged to the early conservatives who joined with , aristocrats, the Nazi government, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">He was among those who persuaded Hintenberg too that everything was going to be fine until he found out better and had to be put on ice himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But he was put on trial for helping the big shots into their saddle. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It was the right and just thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Compared with the job of course performed by the others, his was minor, a minor crime compared. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It was a big crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I wouldn't have let him go scot free, but compared to the crimes committed by the others, he impressed me by his intelligence and by the nerve he actually had and a sense of humor too and dissociated himself publicly by gesture and position and posture from the rest of the crew. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But the rest of them as I said, sad and drab mediocrities. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Sad and drab. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Physically unattractive, no disgusting, especially , who insisted on talking to us in English most of the time, which he knew fairly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">His German was miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I talked to him in German and tried to correct him several times, but none of his sentences were ever completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Most of the time they ended help me, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">This man had an important figure at the time he was in power. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Now, the whole lot of them including the military were just sheer sad and drab mediocrities. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The only one who as I said who admitted on occasion responsibility for what was done over an order that showed his signature was Goering, but he too was an inferior being and the tip off that signaled that inferior being was his demeanor and attitude toward I don't know if I mentioned that before toward the big four. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">To the French, the weakest of the Allies, he was patronizing if not scornful. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">To the Americans, he tried to impress us as a kind of guy who would be a good fellow to the bucaneering Americans who were suckered on Hollywood films. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">To the British who are precise, cold, correct, he tried to emulate a gentlemenlines because he respected the British, but when he saw a Russian, he winced. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The minute the Russian officer entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation room</span> , he winced and cringed slightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He knew of no posture that would impress a Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He was scared to death of any Russian and every Russian that entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And that, let me tell you, was true of the whole lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The whole motley crew. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I had no respect for any one of them, and I couldn't in as much as I tried to show even a spark of sympathy for any of them, I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And I'm not a harsh man myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I can sympathize. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I can empathize, but what I saw there imagine me empathizing with a disgusting creature like Striezer. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The way he appeared he struck me as belonging to an inferior animal kingdom like rats and vermin more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I had a physical disgust actually towards most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I would have hated to be touched by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I didn't shake hands with anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">There was one exception among all the people that I interrogated myself and that was . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">SS general, young, university educated, gangster, but handsome, intelligent charming courteous differential, respectful, especially of a fellow academic, which he recognized in me immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">He almost succeeded in deceiving me. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">You know I'm the kind of person who was brought up to regard Latin and Greek, if not Hebrew as the proper guise, the proper garment of the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I thought anybody brought up in what I called , 1n the humanist spirit could be nothing other than a humanist scholar and a benefactor to mankind and person interested in nothing but the welfare, the well being and happiness of mankind. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He also succeeded in deceiving me into believing that he really belonged on my side. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">That he was really interested in salvaging and making available to me what was to be made available in way of searching and finding the truth for the benefit of those who were responsible now for building a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He almost succeeded in doing this until I found out about his background, which was shortly thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Shortly after I had thoroughly interrogated him, he had in a manner of speaking my sympathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He was my favorite culprit. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He was the one person I felt at ease with and to whom I offered a cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I didn't do that to anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I tried to make him feel at ease, and whom I interrogated. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Now, that's very interesting, who I interrogated on side interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I was also interested as a zionist in making sure that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would become <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that is that the zionist of course would prevail, win, and win as much as it could. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And that some of the hopes and some of the hopes of the surviving Jewish people could be fulfilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So, I interrogated him about well he must have had and did in fact have access to the of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">When did he meet the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> I asked him and under what circumstances and where was that and what was the subject discussed at the time, for what purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Well, substantively the end of the interrogation was substantially came out of interrogation is all he wanted from the was intelligence and all he shared with him was intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And I said well wasn't the interested in the final solution so called of the Jewish person to applied to be anywhere Jews were a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> could be found even in the <span class="REGION">far East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Oh, no, he'd never ask him about that with no word. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I said well, tell me in truth, you know it's all over now, tell me what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">No, I can't tell you doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I can't tell you, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Well, then tell me something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">With whom else did he work, and what else was he interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Did he have any plans about the final solution? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Didn't he promise he would try to execute final solution designs also carried him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Nothing of the sort is known to me, no sir, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Well, I couldn't pump him for more. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Eventually I had found out that this was a man who joined from day one, which was very early at the beginning of the war the SS, and that he had become one of the favorites of Himler himself and that he ended up as a general in charge of intelligence of office four in charge of security and intelligence of the <span class="BUILDING">Security Head Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I also found out eventually that he was the guy who was supposed to kidnap in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> the Duke and the Duchess of Windsor. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">That he was I found that among the documents too, and charged with about it and said make no mistakes and he checked things with as well as with Hitler directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And that he had succeeded even during the so called period, you know right at the beginning before the invasion of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="REGION">Scandinavian countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">He had made contacts in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> at the <span class="DLF">German Dutch border</span> with two British intelligence officers posing himself as an anti- Nazi among the military, anxious to come to terms with people trying to make peace on the <span class="REGION">British side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">He succeeded in kidnapping two of these officers while misleading them and bringing them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They were kept there until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I found out about this I would have loved to interrogate him about that about his involvement with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I never got a chance to do that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But among the more interesting I think for our purposes, for me and trying to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the zionist course, was my interrogation of . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Adolph Eishman's immediate subordinate. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He was one of our witnesses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> too, in my charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I had occasion to do that without any court reporter, without any interpreter present, at the request of my superior officer, Colonel Burkhard, or was it Colonel Ahmen, I forgot which it was, to interrogate this together with Gideon Wolfer, at the time, in British uniform, British officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Subsequently it turned out to be among the first labor party representative of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Together with him, I interrogated the and alone without anybody else in German only about the whereabouts of Adolph Eishman. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">What Eishman's role was everybody else knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I don't have to repeat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He played a major role for which he was eventually judged in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But the search for Eishman began in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , and it was highly appreciated at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Not that it led anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We did not succeed in getting out probably because he didn't know where Eishman had disappeared to. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He, as I said to the just about a year ago to a German t.v. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">reporter who interviewed me in connection with a film about Hanna Aurandt, who was a close friend of mine, about Eishman, I said you know the search for Eishman started in my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> , and I didn't know at the time where Eisheman was in spite of the fact that I had his immediate subordinate in my custody and could pump him to the nth degree, but we didn't succeed in doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We pumped him for a lot of information involving Eishman, involving to the extent that he was accused and had to respond to all the accusations before the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , but something interesting that I asked and that I interrogated about was disclosed in the course of that interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I asked him can you tell me why when it did not make any military sense at all that your Fuhrer insisted on having the Jews transported when transport was very difficult from the west all the way to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Why didn't you kill them right on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">You had plenty of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The German people wouldn't take to it, wouldn't like that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But in the east you'd have more appreciation for that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">They would have sympathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">After all, they didn't like the Jews there either. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They have a long history of not likening them. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">That to me, was a profound shock that there were people among those who suffered under the Nazis who had even were grateful at the same time, if not grateful, but showed sympathy to the Nazis for one task, the kind of destructive work in which they were engaged against the whole world. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">That was a profound shock, and a severe lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">There are enemies in our own ranks and we have to guard against them, and be mindful of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">There are also allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He never said that we suppress the Poles, . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">They had an anti-Slav population policy which the Poles suffered plainly of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They're not the main culprits but they were and there is no question about it and he was truthful about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Plenty of people who profited from and sympathized with the destructed work against the Jews among the Poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  One of the things that I wanted to ask you about was going back to Herz's testimony about slave labor, about the use of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Do you have a particular recollection about his responses on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Well, I tell you, there was a selection process taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">You're aware of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">A selection process taking place and Herz testified as to that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I don't recall any particular details about this, but he testified to the fact that there was a selection process taken place when the shipments came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">You know when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Here where the people were too old and couldn't be used for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for labor at all and they were put on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> those who were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Women and little children were to be destroyed right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Some women not who could do some heavy labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So, my own little cousin, my aunt and my little cousin, two of my little cousins, survived because they could be used a slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">My aunt was a very strong woman, but my uncle, her husband, perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And the older of the two little cousins died, too, on his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The interesting thing is you know when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and after the war in the course of the Russian advance against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my aunt and two of my little cousins, two little children managed to escape to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">dp camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and they can tell you and testify as to details of how things proceeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">My uncle had in the meantime perished and the older one of my little cousins had also perished But the three of them, my aunt and my two little cousins, the younger children managed to escape to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And my aunt said, oh I just heard there's going to be a trial in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Go to the American commander, go to the American officer she said to my little causing, and ask him to permit you to phone the <span class="BUILDING">palace of justice</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and ask for Doctor Maier. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I'm sure Joe is there among the judges, something like that, and sure enough one day I sit in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">That was before the trial had actually begun and I got a phone call my little cousin Billy called me up and said in German we are here and my mother and my sister we are here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">dp camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I said stay where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I'm going to have my travel orders cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I'm going to be there day after tomorrow if I get my orders cut and get you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">She knew that I would be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">She knew when I left I'll be back and it was after a terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">This is not going to be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I'm not going to leave you in a lurch. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I get a little bit upset when I think about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">You'll have to forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I eventually managed to get them to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">My aunt worked here. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">She died last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">She was an old lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">That is, she was ten years my senior, she wasn't that old, at least in years. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">My little cousin is a full professor now at the University of Colorado Political Science, and expert in French politics and German politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">He could testify to you what happened right there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studthoff</span> , where he was with my aunt, one of the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">There happened to be also a relative of my wife's who I eventually got out of, when she landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , I happened to be there and I got her to join her sister, whom we had previously given an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She managed to escape to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> before American's entry into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I managed to get her here too. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">She died too, she lost her husband in the concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  I understand you went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where my wife and my sister-in-law and my mother-in- law and my father-in-law and their families were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They had been citizens of for a couple hundred years. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Yes, I managed to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I'll tell you when. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Shortly after the Nuremberg trials had begun and it was over and it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French occupation zone</span> and I had to ask for French permission, the French colleagues and said to go into the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">is on the left side of the Ryan, on the French side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ryan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It's situated between . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">In the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> , I had to ask, as I said to my French commander and French colleague in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to give me permission to go there and of course one of the Generals gave me his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we had an American driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We drove there with the American flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I'll tell you that was a sensation. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I was the first American to land there and those who remembered my wife and my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law and my father-in-law because my mother-in-law was the first woman to be elected to the local community council. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">The first woman, she was the leading woman in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and there were a good many members of the . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They were there to see me to watch me and there wa an old mate of my mother-in-law's who had worked for my mother-in-law's mother, and dressed like my mother-in-law's mother who was there who my mother-in-law assured me was absolutely reliable person and a democrat and anti-Nazi who saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I found the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I should authorize them to take revenge on the Nazis and throw the Colonel out of power and come in with my own troops, put the Colonel out of commission and declare a social democratic government here in . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I mean it was all too fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I said that's the way to deal with allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I can't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I'm a guest of my allies right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">They are full fledged allies they are in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Whatever I do is with their permission even though my driver has the American flag there I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I represent the American government and the American Army and I do this honorably. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I said no fooling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I said I'm not in charge of anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">This is a thoroughly private visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I come to see and put into order and remind you to see that you have to put everything that was stolen or illegally by force acquired or anybody involved in a commission of a crime or robbery has to return everything, safeguard everything until the rightful owner comes to claim it. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I'll come back in a fortnight to check after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And after that they invited me for drinks and we had plenty of drinks and we were a group of about six or seven men then and these people looked through the <span class="DLF">windows</span> who was marching down there, and I was marching to and eventually back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my bride was first born. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And there was a grand hello and a welcome of course by Lena, who was a friend a little older than Alice my wife and a welcome to this day she speaks of that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">As she said from the very first day and offered to return it. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I said I'm not going to take any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">You honestly and rightfully bought it and my mother-in-law will not claim it, but it's nice to be here and I had to sleep in my mother-in-law and father-in-law's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and eventually when I brought my wife two years later or three years later when I came on a research grant, I was already a professor by that time, I lived in -- we were welcomed in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- and we slept where Oma and Opa used to sleep, that is where my mother-in-law and father-in-law slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">That was the <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was reserved for us whenever we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It looks a little difference now, but from day one, I learned from the when I was there the first time, I said I want the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to be brought in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I'm going to come back and I want that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , whoever is around here make sure the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> is brought in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I want every stone to be put where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I don't want it to be made smaller by an inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I want a <span class="DLF">fence</span> built around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I said I want to recognize it because I'm going to be there and my wife is going to be there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We want to see that this what we call , that is the burial places of our fathers and mothers are kept in tact. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">They testified for our presence for hundreds of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I wanted that to be brought in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I said I'm going to hold personally responsible for anybody who disturbs or fails to do his duty in that regard. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I'm going to tear out everything and I can do that when I get furious about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So, they were sufficiently intimated but they needed, because I was talking mainly to my friends who were at my disposal and took me there took great care to take me to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to see what needs to be done, what has to be done and who has to be in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">For years thereafter, I followed up on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And every time that we went as we did in the last couple of years until only recently when serious illness befell both Alice and me, my wife and me, we used to go over there pretty regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">to the <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span> to look after things were properly done. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">My niece, who is your colleague at the <span class="BUILDING">memorial museum</span> never fails to pay a visit when she has a chance to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which her grandparents lived and which her aunts and I had spent some time and had good times as well as sad times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Do you have any thoughts about spending time longer in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  I tell you I had an opportunity after the war crimes trials ended to become a control officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in charge of radio and press and talk to my superiors about that possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I once was interested in building up <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">It would have involved of course taking permanent residence there, and it would have involved bringing my family over, that is Alice and my little daughter over and live to be sure decently as a matter of fact in one of the <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> that were not destroyed in near in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , if you know the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where American officer personnel were It was a very tempting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I wrote to Alice about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I said would you be willing to come? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">She said no, it's not for us to be even tempted to be profiteers of the victorious army of which you are a member. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">For better or for worse, I don't want to expose our child to any possible attacks to Nazis hiding somewhere around the corner or under the rubble of a completely destroyed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I think if you're really interested in the <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> and your last chance for

all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I followed that instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I always trusted her instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">li was given to patterns. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Once I made up my mind I had a theory and believed firmly in the theory, but patterns and theories are worth less than the sound . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They have a better instinctive sense of judging the character and feeling out an opportunity or sensing an opportunity and knowing people better. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">She was a much better judge of character among the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> where she after all spent a lot of time through, than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I was a student mostly interested in ideas and in patterns as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Finding fool proof devices, something like this. </span><span

had my travel order card as long as I was in the army and in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I could go most anywhere in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I traveled very often to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> because I had become as I told you make good friends there during war time and I felt that that was in a sense coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Anytime I had a deferment I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> or I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or I never traveled that much in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I got to know more about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> than I ever known as a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I stayed put in . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I was afraid to move to where we eventually had to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I would have stayed on the <span

class="sentence" id="549">Well anyway when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in '46 I was a bit unhappy but Hanna was there and she got me a job with the and so Hanna and I worked on the edition in the original, and my job was to write the dust jackets and read all the works of and write the dust jacket for every volume and proofread the major translations of Jewish for which few

id="552">I knew Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I knew Latin and Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I could check all the sources which Hanna made me do, which I did of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Until in '47 I got my job at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rutgers</span> where I spent the rest of my academic career, 35 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I became emeritus in 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We have 12 years ago, but I tell you I have worked more in the <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> and written more since I'm retired because I not only taught every summer at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> I became associate of the University seminars that is the faculty seminars in the early at the end of the 50s and I've been the chairman of one of the social science seminars on context and message of the social sciences for the last 20 years and I'm being reelected.

<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  It sounds like a very, very rich career. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">If you can take one more questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  Oh yes, by all means, two more if you want.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Tell me what you thought leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> or looking back on it at whatever point, how you felt for the search for justice at that point, what kind of views did you have of the justice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I was involved on occasion in discussions with German attorneys, German defense attorneys, the attorneys for the about the international and the legal basis for such a tribunal, and they said my goodness you fellows -- they suggested very courteously a proceed on the basis of retroactive law which is forbidden in your constitution on which your practice all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">My argument at that time was this was such an extraordinary situation what happened when we came and what we faced at the end of the war is a , a legal vacuum. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We had to establish and give teeth to for the first time international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Henceforth, we have to set an example first and for all times to come to set an example that such crimes will be punished by one authority or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I may feel, I don't know if we have done a full measure of justice especially in the subsequent trials as the industrial ones were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I think they got away with murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I think some of those who employed slave labor got away with murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I think I must say even though I liked him, our first high commissioner McCloy, pardoned a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I didn't have a good feeling about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Maybe he was justified. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Maybe that was all necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I was also interested and that's how I quieted, how I softened my pangs of consciousness, interested and give me a chance for the to <span class="REGION">Western Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Give them a chance if they conduct themselves as they have conducted themselves properly not only in the restitution questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I mean restitution claims by the German citizens and German sufferings and non-citizens, Jews who had suffered in the in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I done also a good deal, more than any Jewish source, including the whole American Jewish effort, to rebuild, to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> onto its feet economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I think for that I was willing to bargain to soften my own conscience, but not at the price of forgetting what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">As a matter of fact, what I'm interested in now, as President, I don't know whether you know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I'm the president of the Association for the Preservation of Jewish Culture and Monuments in Europe, especially in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , including <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="REGION">Western Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> didn't have a chance because it was under communist rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I didn't have a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I hope eventually to get a chance to visit those <span class="BUILDING">shrines</span> , those monuments physical monuments that are capable of preservation of rebuilding. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So that generations of Germans and other Europeans will learn that we were among those who dwelled among them and what was committed was against us was . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I told my German friends who helped me with this, and there are plenty of them, every time I say it you must learn that doing that kind of job, and helping me do that kind of job, by searching out the history of the smallest German Jewish communities, not only recreate, I can't do it anymore and the likes of me can't do it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I want German students to learn Hebrew to learn Latin and Greek to be among those who rebuild in scholarship by rewriting and rediscovering the smallest of the German Jewish community and the whole holy Roman empire of the German nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> proper but what used to be called the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish buildings</span> are there so that one day these young Germans will tell the story was what happened was a ,a as I call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Only then will the Germans have come to terms with their own past. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Only then will I recognize ultimately has been effective. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Only then will I be satisfied having done my duty and in deed I have found such friends who are working on this, have been helping, and this I am still trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">This effort the task on which I am almost exclusively engaged, as long as I'm engaged at all, as long as there is breath in me.</span></p>
