<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  My brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  My brother's name was Alan Baer Costinski. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He want that last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larch</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And he came with my mother just shortly before the -- the first World War to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  With your mother only?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Because my father was a prisoner in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German prison camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And she knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She walked all the way from -- but the Germans came and they took everything away and there was nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She had two more children younger than the one that I knew, and that's a boy and girl, but they both died, I really don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But the Germans came in and they -- that's the first World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  And they destroyed everything and there was nothing left for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So when she only had that one little boy left, she took him and she walked all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And during the day, she stopped over somewhere on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and only nights she walked until she -- by the time she reached the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the war was practically over and she just walked across. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And she went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> where my father was and they got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And there was nothing to go back to to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So they stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But then later on after they got a little established, my sister was born in 1921 and I was born in 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  What's your sister's name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  IdA:
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So what do you remember from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Tell me about your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What did your parents do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Well, after the war it wasn't bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But unfortunate -- which had nothing to do with Hitler -- when I was only three years old, my mother fell down a flight of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and she never recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It wasn't anybody's fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was her own fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">She should have gone into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and be in a cast. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But she said, I have small children and I can't afford to go into a cast and she neglected herself, which had nothing to do with Hitler or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He wasn't even there yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And, of course, after a while instead of getting better, she got worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And she's been in and out of <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> since I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So I was only three so I barely remember my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And by the time I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there was talk about Hitler being the new chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So my father said, well, I think we're going to put the girls right away in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Because my brother went to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  When he first came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> he couldn't speak the language, but it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But when he heard about Hitler being so much against Jews, he says, I'm not going to put the girls in the Jew -- in the <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So we went right away into a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  From the time we started <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  But you could speak German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, we learned German and we learned Hebrew --
QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  -- in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We had every morning one hour of Hebrew from Monday to Friday five days a week and then it was from eight to nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And nine o'clock we had regular subjects, German, arithmetic, geography, history, you know --
QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  -- regular subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But it was only for Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  So most of your friends were Jewish or did you have German friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Well, not really because mostly after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you go to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But as I did not really have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go -- I mean, I had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but there was nobody there --
QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  -- because my mother was in and out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My father was busy and I had to make a living so we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">day care</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So straight from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we went into <span class="BUILDING">day care</span> and we were there until six o'clock at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  By that time my father was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- and so I --
QUESTION:  So the <span class="BUILDING">day care</span> was for German children too, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It wasn't --
ANSWER:  No, it was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Oh, it was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  It was a Jewish day care, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We had sort of a hot meal during the day so at night wasn't much of a meal just, like, a sandwich or something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And what did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Well, as I said he was in the Army when he -- before he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So he didn't really have a profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So the -- at first, he did whatever he could just to make a living for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But then he opened up a little tobacco store. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And those days everybody smoked and it was a good business. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He was doing -- I mean, we were not rich, but he made a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We had enough to pay rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There was always food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and he was doing all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  So you remember Hitler coming to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">By the time I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was practically -- as a matter of fact, they used to put on the radio in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and we had to listen to his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Oh, in the --

<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  You mean in the <span class="DLF">street</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Well, at the beginning in the early '30s it wasn't bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Everybody was very nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And as a matter of fact, we lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was a walker. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And as you come up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> there were two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> on each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Here was our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and this was a -- German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And there was only one <span class="DLF">wall</span> between our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and their <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and you could hear practically -- when they walked or every word they said, you know, like the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And we had no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I don't even know if there were other Jewish people in this <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There were four <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But because I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I just left 7:30 in the morning to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I never saw anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But the lady that lived right next door to us on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , my father used to go early in the morning, like, six o'clock and that -- those days we didn't have refrigeration -- and used to go down and buy some groceries. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I don't know if every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Depends on the weather how long you can keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And every time used to come out early in the morning and the lady came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">She used to say, good morning to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">How are you how? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">How 1s your wife doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Because she knew she was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Once -- so sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">You got small children and with a sick mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And they were friendly people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Do you know their name or --
ANSWER:  Oh, I can't remember the name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  I know there was only a lady and a young boy was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He was like a teenager later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And as we (?</span><span class="sentence" id="135">certain?) </span><span class="sentence" id="136">were so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But then in 1936 my mother passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And, you know, I wouldn't even know it but -- you know what a Minyan 1s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  You have a ShivA:
QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Or when somebody passes away for one week we have mourning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Which they call a ShivA: People come in the morning for service and they used to come in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Twice we have the Minyan. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Minyan means you have to have at least 10 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  10 men to make the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So in '36 it wasn't bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My father belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , people used to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We're not allowed to go out for one week and people bring you food to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So we were in that whole week. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We didn't go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But the next -- the following Sunday -- my mother died on a Friday in July of '36. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So on Sunday was the funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So the following Sunday when we finished the Shiva, my father was going downstairs to buy groceries for following week or days. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So the minute he got into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> the lady jumped on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She says, I know your wife died more than a week ago and you did not turn in her ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">That's how I remember we must have been on ration. '</span><span class="sentence" id="161">36. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That was three years before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And if you ask me, I wouldn't even know we were on ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Just because he came up and he told us the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So he says, I beg your pardon. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I was in mourning. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We don't go out for one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I came down this morning to turn her in ration card and buy my groceries. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So she calmed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Because 1n '36 it wasn't too bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  When did it get bad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  You could still talk to a Jewish person. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But when we went to the <span class="DLF">park</span> all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> had written on, not for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You couldn't sit on. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But there were only three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> in that whole big <span class="DLF">park</span> , huge <span class="DLF">park</span> , only for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But nobody ever sat on those three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I remember that because some time on a Saturday --
QUESTION:  How did you feel about that, that you couldn't --
ANSWER:  We were just kids, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But like on the Saturday or Sunday when we didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">day care</span> we use to say, oh, Papa, can we go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You know, but he worked hard all week. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He had to get up early. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And he said, oh, I'm so tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So in the winter, of course, he used to go sleep in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But in the summer, you know, he tried to be nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I mean, I didn't realize, you know, we had no mother most of the time, and he was mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But when you're a child, you don't realize that it's a double job for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So he tried to be nice and he took us to the <span class="DLF">park</span> as much as he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I remember one day we were in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , we were playing something like hopscotch on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , my sister and I. And he sat down on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and it said, not for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But he had covered the writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  And he figures, well -- but he did not look Jewish because he had light eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He had gray hair since I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So he must have been on the light side. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And then a man, a German man, came and sat down next to him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And he was watching us playing and he tried to make a conversation with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He didn't know who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So he says, you know, I feel sorry for those children. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Isn't it terrible what they're doing to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">At that time -- so my father just sat and he nodded. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">He didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So we just came over and we said, oh, Papa, something -- when he heard us calling him papa, which means father, he realized that he was our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And he got up and he flew away like they were chasing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">In case they catch him talking to him, they'll arrest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">That's how bad it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  So that was later and not -- because you said in '36 it wasn't that bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Yeah, '36 it wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But Hitler was in power since '33.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  And '36 it was already -- you know --
QUESTION:  So do you remember --
ANSWER:  It was hard to walk in the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  Was it gradually that...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Little by little it got worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But then later on the lady came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Did I say this already? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And she said, how is your wife and all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And then she says, well, you have to excuse me, I wouldn't able to say good morning to you anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  Because my son is now in the Hitler Youths. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">16-year-old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And if he sees me talking to you, he'll report me. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I'm talking to a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">She was afraid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Right next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We were living next door to each other for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">She says, I have nothing against you personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We've been living together for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We've been -- you've been a good neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It's nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So my father just said, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">He knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It wasn't her fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">She's a very nice lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I don't know if there was a man there because he only was talking about her and the son.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  So I have no idea if there was a father there or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  But you do remember her and her son?</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="760">Looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw the Gestapo <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I said uh-oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Now they're going to come and take us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I was scared like anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">But I didn't realize -- I forgot we were going through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So then I realized this must be the <span class="DLF">border</span> because they came on. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">It was a <span class="DLF">border crossing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So they had to come on and look at your passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So he says, passports, passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">You know, young guys in Nazi uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So I got up and I took my little suitcase down. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So you know what he said? </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">He didn't want to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I could have taken anything with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I was like -- but my sister was, like, she took everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Boy, what they did to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Well, anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">It took 15, 20 minutes we cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I said, thank God I'm out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Now I don't have to worry anymore once you're out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">But we were going for a while and all of a sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped again. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I said, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Another <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="785">We're going straight through the <span class="DLF">channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But when I looked up there was no Gestapo <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They were Dutch women with baskets of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I still cry when I hear about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I got a tissue, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So they knew the children were coming so they brought us refreshments. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Wasn't that wonder -- perfect strangers they came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Wasn't that something? </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I never forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And then we traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> until the rest of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">About 10 o'clock we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And we were by the -- by the British channel. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And then they lined us up, make sure everybody was -- I think there were 300 children on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from the connection spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And they said, well, I want everybody to go straight to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> where they're assigned to. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And it is 10 o'clock now -- 10 o'clock we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> is not going to start going until 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But don't wait for 12 o'clock because six o'clock in the morning if you're going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span> and you have to be packed and upstairs ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So go right to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Don't wait for 12 o'clock until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And when we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , Fritzi and I, we shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and a top one. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">We had to toss a coin, which one gets the top and which one gets the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">That was so cute, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">We were just kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And anyhow she slept on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And as we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> she kept talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">She says, are you sleeping?
