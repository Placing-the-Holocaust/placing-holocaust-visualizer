<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Dr. Miller, could you please tell me your name, your name during the war, your date of birth, your place of birth, and anything you possibly can about your childhood and your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , October 16, 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My family name was Rosenblum, Eugene in Polish, it was Eugeniusz. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And I grew up in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was used to be called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish Manchester</span> , of about 600,000 inhabitants. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Today is about 1,000,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">It was 2™ largest Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was inhabited by about 200,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">It was a vibrant Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My parents came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> after fleeing <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They were married in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My mother was studying at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My father fled <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> with my mother in 1923 during the Gurinsky regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">which was really the forerunner of KGB. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">They were arresting all the people who were by them the . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So my mother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , 1923, she was pregnant. , </span><span class="sentence" id="18">she’s going to parents to wait for birth and my father crossed the Russian-<span class="DLF">Polish boundary</span> and he was wounded by the way the Russians were shooting when they were crossing and arrived in the Polish city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My mother joined him. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">There where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was born in middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My father . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We lived in a very nice section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Do you know the name of that section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Notobicuk 41</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Well, at that point, I better tell you something about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was divided largely three different segments. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The Orthodox Jews which occupied section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They wore Hasidic garb. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">That was about 40% of Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">That was a large section of the working class people and that was substantial amount of the middle class or upper middle class Jews who were rather prosperous and they lived, for lack of other words, in the nicer part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Most of the people lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you didn’t have the , the <span class="REGION">land</span> was too expensive so you have big <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We had about five or six room <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and like all of the people who live in this section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we have a maid, a live-in maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We have a girl who came to cook and you always have somebody who came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machine</span> , ever so often and done the wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I was attending <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It was one of the few <span class="BUILDING">gymnasiums</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from which one could go straight to <span class="BUILDING">Polish University</span> with government rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We didn’t have to pass any exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">At the same time, when they issued the anfamatura which was probably the closest to it in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is the regents exams that you get in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">When they issue the certificate of completion. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was also recognized in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> and you could enter right away the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> to pass a special examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There were three <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , they called it 1S' <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and 2" <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They were just across from each other and there was a <span class="BUILDING">girls gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">As I grew up, we participate most, most of the children attended the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were members of Zionist organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">At that time, probably what organization you belonged, it wasn’t determined by your political views because we were just teached at that time but it was determined by the shahim the representative of the kibbutz movement, who was a better organizer was able to attract more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I belonged to Hashoma Hatsayeer, although my parents were well off, it was left wing organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="48"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by itself, even before Hitler, was anti-Semitic state. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">When we were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I remember very often we have to cross the so-called <span class="BUILDING">people university</span> , and we went through a hail of stones thrown at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I remember when I was growing up after the dictator of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> died in 1935, who understood that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> needed the middle class and Jews were the middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They were the profession, they were the merchants, they were the manufacturers. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">After he died, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became openly anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , oh it was about 15-20 minutes walk, I passed at least five or ten <span class="DLF">intersections</span> and there was always scribble on the corner, “Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ”. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, since <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was verantly nationalistic and they were afraid of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , it bordered on hysteria how they were afraid of Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Jews, even from affluent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , just as a purpose of what they saw and the atmosphere 1n which they grew up, were drawn to left wing organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I find myself Hashoma Hatsayeer where we all realize although we were children and I was fifteen and a half when the war started, we all realize that there is no future in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My parents wanted me to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , my father had a brother over there who was manufacturer, a silk manufacturer, he felt he wanted me to go and study in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Polish Jews were not admitted, there were some <span class="BUILDING">Polish University</span> but there were numerous clauses. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Numerous clauses mean restricted quota for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was very hard to get, so most of the Jews went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nance</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasburg</span> and they lost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They learned French and they got the degrees there. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was slated to go over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My childhood was a happy one but we knew there was no future in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  What can you tell me, was your family observant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well, it was maybe in sense of American values. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">There was on big, great <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">To Orthodox Jews, it was probably worse than going to a reformed <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But yet, the women were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , the men sit on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and my parents attend the high holy days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Did you keep kosher at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Quasi kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Because of my grandfather, was quasi kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We are not a very observant family in the usual standards of Polish Jewry but still I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> and culturally we were very much Jews but quote, unquote emancipated Jews and not religious Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My father belonged to Hartzerarde. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">In Hebrew this is . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That was the . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My mother worked as a volunteer for ORT which organization supported the teaching of trades to the Jewish kids who didn’t have the financial means to go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Not that many in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , a very small percent of children went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Probably, no more than five or ten percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">By Jews, much larger percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I cannot put the exact percentage but most of the children did not finish <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">This kids were trained by ORT, they were in dire straits and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Naturally, the religious Jews tried to educate their children in the <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> , did not have government rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  My parents spoke Russian among themselves, that was the language they knew the best but they spoke fluently Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">As a matter of fact, my father spoke fluently Polish, German and Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So did my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My mother also spoke French. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But to me they spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I didn’t know that much Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I don’t know for the purpose of a background maybe, the Zionist begged the parents not to teach the kids Jewish, to teach Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I learned Yiddish already from my father-in-law a little bit after I got married and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but no, no, we spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We spoke probably Polish better than Poles because the way they were able to recognize that a girl which had Aryan look but was Jewish that she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Jews spoke pure Polish without any regional inflection. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Almost every Pole had a little bit regional inflection. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Our Polish was colorless or classic. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So we spoke very well Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I liked the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I don’t like the people but I still like Polish literature, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But our orientation was very much Zionist, because in our mind there was no other solution to the Jewish problem in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but to immigrate; immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was restricted so probably most of us knew we would have to go to some <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was not in our future. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">When the war started, I was fifteen and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Polish radio started to broadcast the third or fourth day of war, urgent appeal all men should go in direction of center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> which is about 120 kilos, that’s from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Most of the men left. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I went together with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> before the Germans were able to lay siege around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We lived through the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">When I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we were not allowed to have a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">No gentile could work for Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But, we still had our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I had a big dog, a Great Dane.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Rex.</span><span class="sentence" id="113">The dog was seven or eight years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I remember it was two or three weeks after we returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was still probably middle of October or end of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">My mother took all of her jewelry except one small ring off of her hands and somebody knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My mother opened and a German, a German non-commissioned officer pushed the <span class="DLF">door</span> open, grabbed my mother’s hand and tried to take the ring off. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">He didn’t see the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The dog jumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The dog was 140-130 pounds Great Dane. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and he went to his throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He pointed the gun at my mother and he told to me you won’t take the dog away, Ill shoot your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I said “put your gun away and I’ll try to take the dog but don’t move”’. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I took the dog away and he told my mother should take her coat, she is going to the criminal police and he will charge that we instigated the dog to attack a German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Well, my mother spoke very well German. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">She told, “all right, I want also to ask if the German soldier is allowed to act as common robbers if all that we have belongs to the German government, you certain of the German government’. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Well, after long negotiations, my mother gave him some valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He relented but I had to take the dog down and I had to tie him, that was a contraption that was used to beat the rocks, clean the rocks and I had to tie the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And he shot the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">That was the first thing I lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I was sick for three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That was the first loss of somebody I love. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I loved the dog because I grew up with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Well, things got worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We were ordered to put Stars of David, the yellow patches in the shape of the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We wore one on the left breast and one on the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I said I’m not going to put it on and I went out and I was caught and I was very badly beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I told my father that I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">At that time, to Russia occupied zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">At that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> allowed every few weeks, the people who come there divided <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> to cross <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> occupied part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My father told me he doesn’t have the strength or inclination to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He said son, you might not realize but to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> 1s one-way ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You will be able to get in but you will never be able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I fled from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I'll take my chances with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And that wasn’t just my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">To them the Russians were the occult Bolsheviks and this and they still felt the Hitler regime was aberration and whatever will happen, they’Il survive the war and things return to normal and they will live in free Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So they gave me some valuables and sent me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">My mother told me when I was leaving on my way to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , “Son, take a good look at your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You will never see them again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I went and I was an only child, 16 years old, never away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> except when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And these words, I could hear the words in my ears to the entire way I reached the <span class="DLF">Russian boundary</span> and they were supposed to open the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I waited for about three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I decided, well whatever is going to happen is going to happen to me and my parents and when I returned, they were already in process of setting up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I think, was established in the first month, I don’t remember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The <span class="DLF">ghetto boundaries</span> were already established and the Jews were encouraged to move there. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Nobody was moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">At that time, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volhynia</span> , from the parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the states which <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartments</span> as we lived in the nice section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where one of the parents were to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Two German officials came and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus . (</span><span class="sentence" id="160">couldn’t hear) to go, so we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">We were able to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in one of the two or three <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> which had modern conveniences like water, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flush toilets</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to which they press around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000 people and that was the worst slums by looting. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">There were very few <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> which really resembled anything we know before we got the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in one of these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They closed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and in the beginning it was already no more horrors by the Germans, there were no more beatings, there were no more shootings. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started to organize itself but almost from the beginning the rations of food became much smaller and we got progressively less and less to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I didn’t finish <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I finish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Polish didn’t have right. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They forbid Polish to have any kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They close all <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Somehow, they probably knew they were going to liquidate the population sooner or later they pay no attention so <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> open in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so I finish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">What happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in beginning years, it was a slow starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The , aman in his early 60’s, he was a minor official in the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He was active in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He never had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He raise quite a bit of money for the orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He was one of the few people who didn’t flee when all the men left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">When the Germans came and he was there and they told him he 1s the alderman of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He started to organize Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The men were already had their blood which he bought by the <span class="DLF">grave</span> of his wife which was buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">He was really widening up his ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Evidently, all the power of the Germans was vested in him. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">He became absolute ruler of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to us he seemed like a man that was drugged with power On the other feeling of course was that if we are going to make useful our services to the Germans, good part of the Jews might survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">No bodies even worst fears believed that the Germans would try to physically annihilate every woman and child. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Well, he establish <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He started to establish so-called “arbisin”, they were <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> which manufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people who administer the ghetto brought to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they have a large number of people working in the <span class="BUILDING">resorts</span> and in exchange they were sending food to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What I remember from now on, I was still young but was rather a shielded childhood and we grew up in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">What I remember was hunger, terrible hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And it started very, very slowly by the people who were middle aged. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I say people after 40, 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They had started to deprive. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">More and more you saw people who had swollen feet, swollen hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The winters are very harsh in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and there was nothing to heat their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> with or the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">There was very little even wood or coal briquettes to be able to cook something. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">People were very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">A lot of them tried to crumble the bread and cook the bread and make a soup out of this so that physically they could pacify their hunger pangs. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But, they consumed a lot of liquid and the heart was not able to pump and the water settled in the feet and people started to die out. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And we had 60, 70 funerals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">50 funerals a day will be 1,500 people a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">That was in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">In the beginning, the funerals resembles more or less which were held before the war but sooner or later there was only <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Well, like a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> , one mount under the other <span class="DLF">unmarked graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My father was taken 1941 to Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They had the registers. (</span><span class="sentence" id="205">can’t understand). </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He came very badly beaten and he died a few weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I was left with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But yet the younger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The morale was, well, we still felt that we had a chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">This had changed in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">In 1942, the runcoston hada assembly. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It’s 92, 50 years before and I still remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He said to us, he stand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he organized <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> even un <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Jews over 60 years old and children under 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He told us, you have a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Our police would take them and it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it would be much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> want to survive, they have to give up 20,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we all go. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Yet, they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and the Jewish police went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">All the sickly people and the older people and the children were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Some people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They tore the children from the mothers’ arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They beat the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">The mothers who resisted were shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the children away. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Only when the child was already on the horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , they realize what happen, they start to chase and cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And from then on, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The food supply didn’t improve -- deteriorate, more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">There was a lot of mismanagement, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He tried Rumkoski tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be rationed to the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">In 1942, I think, 1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as much valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so called sondokommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He tried to bring some order to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">In a way he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">He made the thing look a little more efficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more were given and people were left in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when you walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench, because the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The people became living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and you could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end soon, they are going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> lived until 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  What were you doing this whole time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I was working in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of a sort of a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> getting my rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">In 1943, my mother died of starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">She lost weight progressively and finally she was not able to walk any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">She stayed in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> constantly. (</span><span class="sentence" id="250">very low -- can’t hear).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Had she been working?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Well, she had been working until she got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">She did ina <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Then she got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">She got the typhoid fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">She got sick, she never recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">She died. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I was left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">In 1944, the Germans started to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They ordered that people will report, about 5,000 people a day, for deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Of course, they refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So to give the order for deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So the Germans took the enslight the head of the ghetto administration, went from <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> promising that people will go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , living conditions would be better, they will be better fed and so forth but nobody trusted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">People tried to avoid deportation as long as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> in August 23 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We didn’t know where we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Probably if we would know where we go and what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is, we would get vicious to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and probably shot, but that would be at least passive resistance but we really didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Had you heard about the camps at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"> Lodz ghetto</span> was the most isolated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Every hundred feet you get a German guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We didn’t get no papers, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Supposedly, few survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chedno</span> were able to escape but the population didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We knew that clothes came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the people who were deported, the old and the sick people and people had foreboding that nothing good comes and they probably perish but they didn’t know that systematic extermination and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Well, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">There was hundred people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> in which we were transported. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We went for about three or four days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Can I stop you? </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I want to flip the tape over. (</span><span class="sentence" id="279">END OF SIDE A)
ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So, when we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , there were 100 people in our, whatever you call this, and what they gave us, there was one bucket which was supposed to serve if people wanted to relieve themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">There was no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">A little bit of food we took with. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I think it took us about four days out to reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We came at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We were allowed to take hand baggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">When the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened, we saw people pointing to us looked like a fine striped pajamas uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But they spoke to us Polish and told us, “please leave all the things <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Just get out, get out, get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Before we could do anything else, we form a <span class="DLF">line</span> , we saw a lot of SS running with the pistols and with guns, whipping people and we were marching top a well lighted <span class="DLF">platform</span> and Mengele was standing there and conducted the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And with a flip of the hand, some went to the right, some went to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We had no idea what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I went to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They took us, they took all the clothes away, they shave us completely and they give us the striped uniforms and a number and we were led to a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294"><span class="BUILDING">Barrack</span> that were former quarters of Austrian cavalry from before WWI and when you slept over there you could lay down on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> but we were pressed so much that there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to turn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I still have, 50 years, I have scars about size of half dollar because we were all bones at that time and laying and pressing, the bones were pressing against the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and the things got infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I was about two weeks -- I wasn’t in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was part of <span class="BUILDING">Auschwitz complex</span> but there was, people didn’t work over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">People were either sent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , either sent out to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You could see when we went to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , the flames shooting and the block leader told us what it is, that the people from the selections are having appointment with their forefathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Well, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I was selected and put into a transport and I met one of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and we decided that we stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And we were, together, almost to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We were deported to the commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">That was a separate camps of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was much minor camp in comparison. . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">There were just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in which the Jews worked until they dropped dead and they send us more and more and more people.. I was in the lager 4 which was I was in lager 11 which was , and we work on Commander Morris. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">All day we had to carry 50 pounds cement sacks from early dawn till it got dark and we always carry number of people who died. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">If you couldn’t work, they beat you to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And we had to carry the dead bodies back because they have to count every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We stood on the appell <span class="DLF">platz</span> , that was the place where they counted the prisoners and the number of the prisoners had to tally, even if we stood late in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I was lucky for a short while to get the job . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Then they used us to take care of other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">When you are sick, when you get your slice of bread you couldn’t eat everything and there was a lot of bread left. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">At that time, I gained some weight but after a while the Germans got tired of it and they took away with the transport all the sick people, the <span class="DLF">block</span> was liquidated and we went back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  You weren’t too sick to leave, you recovered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">At that time, I got infected feet and I got blood poisoning and they took me and doctor , the physician was later -- he attended at our wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">My wife went to <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> and he was director of <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He attended our wedding He told me, you come son, I have to amputate or you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And they didn’t have no anesthetics and he told me “but look, you’ll be in pain but you’ll faint’. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And few people put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , they help me and I just realize at that moment that they are going to take away the toes of my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">They are going to amputate, I’Il be sent away to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So with all the strength I have, I tore myself out and I run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I run away and I went to the working detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">At that time, I had no feeling in my foot and I must have stepped on a very sharp stone and it cut deeply but that saved me and the pus and everything started to drain. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">After the war I still had operation and I had pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">When the Allies started to come in and they started to come in direction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ausborg</span> , which was miles away, they put us all on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Then they started to gather all the prisoners into the main camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , although we were probably no more than twenty, thirty miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , everything wass bombed, and I was in transit for about four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There was no water, there was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Some people went crazy and they drank their own urine. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">When my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , they unloaded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They unloaded my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">That was the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> they unloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">There were more dead than alive and when the American army came two days later, they found the entire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , say the first five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> full of dead prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Well, and what the Americans done -- they put us. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for quite a few months and I decided to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to see if anyone had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We had, during the war, when we knew that they are going to take our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> away, that sooner or later we had to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we had neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Their name was Mitchelene, they were Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He was, the father of the man was Italian and the mother was Polish but they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we knew them very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">As a matter of fact, the woman was carrying , my mother was carrying her . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I knew the people for fourteen years, from the time I moved in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the time I was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">My mother took all the crystals, all the china, all the silver up to them and said, “Look, I doubt if we will get alive from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">That’s all yours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We didn’t expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Well, I went over there when I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I went with the transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Polish transport of course, repatriated to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it was very easy to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I came over there, I went on the <span class="INT_SPACE">tenth floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">A woman opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she tried to slam in my face. “</span><span class="sentence" id="350">We have nothing, we have nothing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I was just able to hold the <span class="DLF">door</span> open and I said “look, I don’t want nothing from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I saw the silver and the money and the crystals all mingled with blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">All I want to know, did somebody from my family, my cousins, did survive, look for me”. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">She said “nobody” and she slammed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I was three days in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and didn’t find nobody and went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">In the beginning, the liberated prisoners
