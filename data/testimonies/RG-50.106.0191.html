<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  How far back does your family go in generations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> only as far as my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But in that corner of <span class="REGION">southwest Germany</span> I have documented it because I do family history, back to 1660, 1670.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  What kind of work did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  He was leather wholesaler jobber. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">The name of the business was Weil and Arnstein and it was established by my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I have finally found out who Mr. Weil was but I have negligible data on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He died quite early and then my father took over the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Did you or do you have any siblings? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
ANSWER:  I have one sister who died two years ago in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">She had both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and guriet [ph]
QUESTION:  Was she older or younger than --
ANSWER:  Three years younger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  And her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Her birth name was Suzanna Carola Arnstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">About, when she first came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , she changed it to Carol because she didn’t want to be called Suzy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  You said before that you came from a middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Did you live right in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  In the heart of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> but in, my father bought a four story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> before he got married and we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and there were tenants on the other three <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Did your mother work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  No, she did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">That’s not quite true. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She went to an arts and crafts school and when she was single she worked in a <span class="BUILDING">porcelain painting factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30"><span class="BUILDING">Factory</span> is an exaggeration. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And after she got married, I owned two pieces with her initials LA Lisa Arnstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I owned one piece signed LW, Lisa Weil. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">That she did work but not after she was married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Did your mother have any help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
QUESTION:  Any housekeeper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Yes, we had a full time live in maid until the Nuremberg laws of 1935 and then we had part time help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  We’ll get to 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Let’s talk a little bit about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Did you speak German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  German and I even spoke the local dialect when I played soccer with the kids or the boys but at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> we were expected to speak reasonably correct German. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My parents cautiously spoke French when they didn’t want the children to understand whatever it is they were talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Later they switched to English. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My father spoke both languages better than my mother, not terribly well but better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  How would you describe yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Were you an independent child when you were young or were you more dependent on your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I don’t know how to answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Yes, I liked to think I was independent but on the other hand up to the age of 13 or 14 you are necessarily dependent and in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my father made the decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">That does not mean he disregarded my mother, but he clearly was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He is the one who decided that I would attend a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> known as a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> where one of the foreign languages was Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And as he said, in my day we had to take Latin and Greek.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about your education. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">You first started at what kind of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Within walking distance there was an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> with two wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">One wing, the larger was Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The other <span class="NPIP">wing</span> , smaller, was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I attended the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant wing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I could have been excused from religious instruction which was part of the curriculum. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I was not and I attended and to this day I remember some Protestant catechism. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011 It was within walking distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , strangely enough, co-educational. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There were 20 boys and ten girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I have a photograph taken in third grade or second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I used to say I can still recall the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Speaking of being in the Protestant section, was your family religiously Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Ethnically Jewish, religiously no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  How would you describe them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Were they very assimilated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  My father had a slightly younger brother named Ernest, which is why I’m named George Ernest who apparently was quite enterprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He broke his neck skiing in the Italian Alps at age 17, 18, something like that which meant that my grandfather had to decide on a <span class="DLF">burial plot</span> to bury Uncle Ernest whom I never knew of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And he picked a plot in the Protestant section of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I cite that as an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And that, of course, it’s then where my grandfather was buried in the family plot. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So was my maternal grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That it’s an indirect answer to your question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Did your parents do anything Jewishly in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when you were very young?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I did not know where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">There were three words which I assumed to be German and in fact they mostly are. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">One was schlemiel, and the other one was plite [ph] which means bankrupt but it 1s so part of the German language. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Anyway I did not know those were Jewish words. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Oy, well there was once in the edition, there was instant Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Did you know you were Jewish when you were little?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  No, not until the Nazis came to power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  For nine years. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It didn’t matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Did you go to any family occasions like a Seder or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  No but I do remember after the Nazis came to power, about 1935 my sister and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gelingen</span> [ph] which 1s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> where there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish training center</span> , presumably preparing people for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And all I remember from that 1s that I did not like the taste of horseradish and that is all I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  So you went to this <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and you were in the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant wing</span> or section. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What were your other interests? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Did you like to read at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Oh we played soccer, we went bicycling. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I was one of the boys and —
QUESTION:  Did you like to read books?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Oh I remember the first two books I owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">One was in German of course, Classical mythology. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">In a version which 1s kind of poetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It 1s so good that it has, that version has been translated into English and published in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">By an author named Schwab, S-C-H- W-A-B. Ihave fond memories of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And the other book was in German, Ein Come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> [ph] , a battle for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It deals basically with the invasion of the Goths, the, and of course, I identified with the Goths, the victorious Goths. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I still remember those two books were a present from a cousin from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  When you were young, did you have any Jewish, any friends that whom you knew were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">You didn’t know you were but did you know —
ANSWER:  It was not a question that arose. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So they may have been but I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">That changed of course after the noose tightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But no, there was a cousin named Uncle Emil who owned the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and he arrived with a black chauffeur driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limousine</span> but it was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Opel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It wasn’t even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I mean it, he was, he existed but didn’t particularly think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
QUESTION:  Let’s get to 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You were an old man of eight and a half, nine years old when Hitler comes into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">What are your first memories of any change from your very happy assimilated childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  First of all nothing changed in, among the boys in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We continued to play soccer and we continued, this was before <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scooters</span> but then gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Nothing happened in any significant way until the Nuremberg laws which meant that we could no longer have a full time housekeeper and that probably led to an explanation by my parents that we were different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Do you remember your reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  You don’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  The other significant thing is there was a cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">This must have been a couple of years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Her name was Marianne. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She was engaged to a gentile Bavarian who was terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He, they took me skiing. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They owned a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fiat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">At the age of 12 on <span class="DLF">country roads</span> , I was allowed to drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So no wonder I think well of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And they of course, she converted to Catholicism. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">She became a Catholic, a convert. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It didn’t do any good and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> and became kind of an older sister to us, or she was appreciably older but she became part of our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and most significantly she owned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we were mechanized for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I cite this only as a reasonably vivid recollection of the influence of the Nuremberg laws and the realization that we were different and Marianne was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The other significant difference is that <span class="DLF">swimming pools</span> started to have signs saying no Jews allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And —
QUESTION:  Not only were you different. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">You knew you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Exactly when and how that happened, I don’t recall but I was different and the difference was Jewish ethnicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Do you remember being frightened about hearing that, that you were different than your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The, my fellow soccer players didn’t treat me any differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">My fellow bicyclists who were the same thing, the same group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  What about the teachers in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  That is a precipitated cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Easter 1938 I had not done my homework or I was late for <span class="BUILDING">class</span> or some minor offense like that and the <span class="INT_SPACE">home room</span> teacher took me to task and said George, or Georg of course, you who are a guest in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And that, that scored. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I remember it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My father had offered me earlier, had raised the question didn’t I want to transfer and go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Where there were family friends with a son my age who were going to look after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Easter 38 I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told my father I’m ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And that was the precipitating trivial incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">There are a couple of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We played soccer as part of the gym class at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And typically you were —
QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> Secondary school</span> you went to, did it —
ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Gymnasium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Were you still in a Protestant section of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or was everybody together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Yes, it was Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The Catholics may have been excused. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I can only remember one other Jewish boy at that point and I still know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He was the son of a — and to my knowledge he’s a, an emeritus professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> or Michigan state.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  What is his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
ANSWER:  Ted Hecht, H-E-C-H-T. Theodore. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I haven’t been in touch with him for years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  But he was the only other Jewish child —
ANSWER:  And he left before me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  He left before you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  I was literally the last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">What I was getting at 1s the soccer teams were chosen either by height or in turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And I was number 11 or number 12 1n size and when the teams were chosen, I was also chosen, something like 11" or 12". </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That’s significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">There are 11 soccer players to a <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But the point I’m getting at is there were two guys who basically deliberately followed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And the teacher, alias umpire, didn’t see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Again, trivial but you were asking for examples and those are the only --
QUESTION:  Did you really see it or —
ANSWER:  Oh, no, no ignored it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Ignored it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  So chose not to see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Chose not to see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Those are about the only incidents I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  What about symbols in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or any of the soldiers, German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Do you remember’? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Symbols in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , did you see any swastikas or — https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
ANSWER:  Oh yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You know for example, my father being the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , was expected to fly a flag prominently on patriotic occasions and he chose the local colors, provincial colors which were red and black, the city colors were black and yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But not the swastika and not black, white and red which were the alternate national colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And we got away with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  What was on his flag, your father’s flag?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  On his flag? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Black and red. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The provincial colors.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What I’m trying to get at, you weren’t especially fearful, frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  No I was not particularly fearful, mostly because my playmates, my fellow bicyclists et cetera, one, he died only eight years ago and I’d been in touch with him for 70 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">His name was Herman. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">His father was a minor government official. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He joined the junior version of the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He then join -- well I wasn’t there when he joined the senior version and he became a lieutenant in the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And I looked him up at the end of the war when I was a GI. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And he had just been discharged from an American POW cage. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So we explored our old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> together.

<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Did you want to be a member of the Hitler Youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  That is what I’m getting at. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">He, I think offered to have me join his troop or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And of course I wasn’t eligible, but sure, they had uniforms and they did all kinds of exciting things. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year had changed from five and a half days of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Saturday morning, to five days of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">No more <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturdays, but the Hitler Youth people above all organized by the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there were excursions, hikes and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And of course the Hitler Youth boys showed up in uniform and we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We didn’t have a uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  We being, you and the other Jewish boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  I don’t remember but there were some non-members of the Hitler Youth who were also in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or in my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So there were some of us were different, not necessarily Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">As I say, I was the only one in my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Ted was, I think, a year behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I also remember one incident where Herman and I were going a block or two away, possibly on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scooters</span> and ran into a couple of other boys who started making anti-Semitic remarks like oh https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011 you can smell a Jew a mile away and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And Herman would knowing full well that I was Jewish which I realize contradicts some of my earlier comments, kind of goaded them on into saying oh we can smell one. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We can see one. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They’re different and all that, knowing all the time that this was obviously preposterous. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">That’s as close as I could come to incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  But you were never physically approached in an anti-Semitic way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Except for the following of, during the soccer game and oh there was one other guy in my class, big not very bright, who I think kind of wrestled with me once and but I ascribe that to stupidity rather than, than ordinary malice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  Did you talk over these changes with your parents about Hitler and about the fact that now you know you’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Was this the kind of topics that you talked about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  I do not recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So I’m tempted to say no we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Well they were not willing to face up to the fact that the noose was tightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They felt this was a temporary difficulty but my father did go to the — Oh two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">My American born grandmother lost her citizenship when she married my grandfather who was a Bavarian local well established.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  She lost her US citizenship?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  US citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Then she was widowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And in 1933 my father said to her, why don’t you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and reclaim your citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Her sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> similarly widowed and situated went with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And the two ladies spent six weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I have a report from a distant relative who claims he invoked the help of Senator Wagner. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">That’s senior. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I don’t know how true that is, but maybe he, anyway they reclaimed their citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And thus my grandmother and her sister are both natural born and naturalized American citizens, which helped certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Well it tells you something about my father’s attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  His awareness. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
ANSWER:  It also meant because I had relatives in the San Francisco Bay area who had not returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when the time came to get an affidavit of support, and assume you know that we would not become public charges, my grandmother got in touch with her genuine first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">In other words they had common grandparents and who supplied the affidavit which was rejected by the American counsel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , on the grounds that the cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> was too old. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Thereupon the cousin’s daughter co-signed and that made it legitimate. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So all of this shows that my parents, or my father who certainly were aware of the tightening noose but didn’t want to face up to the fact that it was more than a temporary condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  You had mentioned previously that you had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , German help and then that changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">How much of a change was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">When the laws came in.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  So your mother was able to keep the housekeeper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  She then had temporary not live in help after the Nuremberg laws forbade because all Jewish men lusted after gentile girls or young women. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So that was the assumption so you couldn’t have a full time live in help but you could have part time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  You are going through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you said the teacher made that comment to you and you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to your father and talked about leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  I said I’m ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> which of course represented some financial problems because there were financial controls. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">German Jews could not dispose of their money freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They had to petition for not for internal household expenses, but for foreign expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Or unusual expenses, like buying real estate or that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I’m not quite up to date, up to date. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I don’t remember that clearly because after all money was not discussed with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But so within two weeks, I transferred, as I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Very quickly I transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Where my friend Roget the son of these family friends, introduced me to the Coloure Saint Antoine [ph] https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011 where I was in the seisieme and they were ahead of us in Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Also scenes of Gallic wars but they were further along than we were and in some other <span class="REGION">area</span> like arithmetic or geometry, they were, that was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I don’t remember those details either. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But above all I flunked the seisieme. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And of all things to flunk, I flunked German because I couldn’t translate it into French and vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So when I repeated seisieme in the fall, I did much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And by early December I left.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  That may have been the depression rather than — he gave up his business in 1929 or thereabouts and went to work for a leather and shoe factory in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I have since recovered some of this information because the grandson of the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> published the memoirs of his grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">All of this was in the past year. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I have some of the details wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But he had a good job with this <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> , probably as the, the leather buyer or I don’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">What I do remember is it was still dark and a winter night at 7:30 in the morning when he joined a <span class="DLF">car pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">A <span class="DLF">car pool</span> , probably he, the brother of the owner who had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they drove out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But that somehow or other sticks in my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But by the time the Nazis came to power, maybe the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ran into problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He reestablished his business on a minor scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Instead of having a separate <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and <span class="BUILDING">storage facility</span> he operated out of his mother’s, my grandmother’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where he had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">My aunt, his sister, unmarried was kind of secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I don’t know those details because money business was not discussed in front of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Our life style as far as I can tell did not change appreciably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  Why do you think that that one remark bothered you so much that you wanted to leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">You https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011 said that you really didn’t experience, aside from the soccer game and so forth, much anti- Semitism.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  13. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">It was quite difficult which is why I turned it down in 1937 when my father first offered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">On the other hand, I did know the family friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> who did a very nice competent job of kind of looking after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I lived in a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">QUESTION:  Because, why do you say that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">ANSWER:  The <span class="DLF">Mall</span> should be American patriotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Just like Martin Luther King is just a little bit off in part because the <span class="BUILDING">Mall</span> is more or less full. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">But. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1275">pause) It’s only in a limited sense the American experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Therefore it’s entirely suitable but maybe off the <span class="BUILDING">Mall</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1277">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would want to say before we close, anything else you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1278">ANSWER:  I should add something about my military experience which obviously is a major event in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">Iam glad I went was sent to the European theater. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">It was a very meaningful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">I don’t want to call it an emotional experience but it and I don’t want to call it vengeance either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">But I was clear what the war was about and I was glad to be doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Something towards it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">I am amazed with hindsight and I was in a small outfit, 160 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">How fully accepted I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">That they never to my knowledge had any doubts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">They weren’t that conscious of the difference between Jewish and non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">The, I was fully accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">QUESTION:  You’re talking about the men in your outfit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1290">ANSWER:  Oh yes, my fellow troopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And of course I was more pivotal than most others because I spoke French and I spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">And I knew all kinds of local things that turned out to be useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I could translate the sign that said Achtung Menin [ph] So I just want to add that was a meaningful experience and I’m glad I was in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011 The experience in military government after the end of the war was also meaningful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">First of all it certainly enhanced my vocabulary to do de-Nazification questionnaires you had to enlarge your vocabulary and your view of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">I also, it also refreshed my memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">One reason why I am probably better able to remember things during an interview like this than others 1s because I had a refresher course at age 20, 21 which living in an environment that evoked all kinds of things that ’d forgotten or would have forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And once again the influence of my wife is massive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">Positive, obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  Do you feel German in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">ANSWER:  I’m not sure I understand the question probably because I can’t answer it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Part of me says <span class="NPIP">hell</span> no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And part of me says well of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">That’s where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">That’s how I spent the first 13 years of my life or 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">I had my father certainly wasn’t Americanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">My mother became quite thoroughly Americanized and learned to speak excellent English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Well she lived within walking distance of her grandchildren and she became a surrogate mother to the grandchildren who to this day think very highly of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Well she had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a <span class="DLF">pool</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">The, but my mother was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And expected me to, I was expected to write <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the army, after the war, regularly, often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And I would get a letter back, punctually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">That simple was a given.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1315">QUESTION:  Were those letters always in German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">To her and back to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">ANSWER:  Ohno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">In English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">Well mine had to be in English because they were subject to censorship.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">ANSWER:  Well not after the end of hostilities of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">But I’d have to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">My mother’s letters almost certainly were in English by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">QUESTION:  Did you talk to your mother in English or in German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011
ANSWER:  We spoke English almost from day one in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">Obviously not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">We had to speak German because we didn’t know enough English but we were hell bent to become Americans and assimilate and learn English which in the case of my sister and me was happened not overnight, but very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And in the case of my mother we increasingly spoke to her in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">We had no intention of going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">This was in the day when it took a week on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer</span> and no, we didn’t want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">Of course I went back within five years but —
QUESTION:  Did your mother ever go back to visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">ANSWER:  Oh my mother went back at least twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">My aunt Nellie died too soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">She didn’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Marianne didn’t go back and my grandmother also, she died in 49, much too soon to go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">QUESTION:  Did you lose any extended members of your family in the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1338">ANSWER:  Extended, yes but not immediate family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Well because I do family history I have of course I mean I have several thousand names and there are lots and lots of victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">But in terms of people that I knew personally, there was a classmate of my father’s who’s also a distant relative who committed suicide in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> because he found out that his nieces and nephews had been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">There was a cousin who of all things was the equivalent of a county judge, not I mean he was a judge but not, who was killed or his wife was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">I don’t remember now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">One of them died of natural causes about that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">I think 1t was his wife and she’s the relative as opposed to the judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">But this is extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Of all the people that I knew I literally can’t think of one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">QUESTION:  When you meet someone from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a Jew of your generation or, do you ever talk about your childhoods or do you not dwell on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">ANSWER:  Well as I told you, Herman came out of a PW cage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">This was September 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">The war ended in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">We explored the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> together and we did it amicably, successfully and nostalgically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">He told me that his, he was a lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">His company commander who was a https://collections.ushmm.org October 23, 2011 captain was a guy who lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and he was four years older than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">He, period, paragraph. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">My wife and I went back and visited Herman and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">This must have been my wife died 14 years ago so I tend to time everything before and after. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">This must have been 18, 20 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And it was a very good visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">He and his wife and my wife and I took a trip out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we visited a ruined <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> on a mountaintop because Herman and I had bicycled there in a one day trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">And we were all staggered that we had managed to do that at the age of 12, 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">But these are selective. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">When I visited, oh the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> had a program to invite its former citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">My wife was by then too ill to travel and so my sister and I and her husband went whenever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And I was interviewed and there was a story in the newspaper with my picture, whereupon there promptly was a phone call from a former classmate in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> who’d like to get together with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Well he was one of those I did not wish to get reacquainted with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">He was the cousin of one of the guys who had followed me during the soccer game. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Now blood 1s thicker than water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">He was a cousin so maybe he was less enthusiastic and less nasty but I chose not to tell him off, not to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">I just not to get reacquainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Does that illustrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">In 1945 probably during that same visit with Herman, I remember walking past the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the teacher lived who had made that precipitating remark and there was the doorbell and there was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Should I break his goddamn <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I chose to ignore him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">So I don’t remember exactly what your question was but my feelings are very clearly no, I do not want to exact revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">I merely want to take advantage of whatever present memories I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1378">QUESTION:  Well that’s a good note to end on.</span></p>
