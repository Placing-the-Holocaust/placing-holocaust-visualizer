<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">What was there -- you see, the Jewish bakeries from before the war, that were there over on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they were baking bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And they had to come to buy flour to the fiflagum sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So what they bought in their Polish money, they didn’t get this back, because th-the German took away the Polish money, they didn’t get the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Anyway, when they -- this way he -- he came to transfer out the money and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I head the department with a head cashier. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">There were five people working with us, to get the money, sort it out, but -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The -- the head cashier was a professional

[indecipherable] Mr. Rosenblatt came. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I knew about her, I didn’t know her. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So -- but -- and she was just as a -- before the war, slowly do it, one time, think of another and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was no time for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So finally I saw the one day, it doesn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So I tells her, “Look, Mrs. Steinbeck, you sit down at the corner, I will operate the <span class="BUILDING">cashier’s office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You sit down there and watch me. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And then you tell me if you can do it or not.” </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The following day, the old people got there, and counting the money, sorting out, and I was sitting there, and I was doing the same time, collecting while I am paying out money, collecting, what she say it couldn’t be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Circumstances are different, this is a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So I worked there for a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">At the end of the day she came into there, “Mr. Klipp, I will do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Okay, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">That’s all I needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And then the money -- what the Jewish bakers brought in, the following day, the Germans took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">There came a Mr. Schwinn was his name, a German from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto Vivaldin</span> , he came to collect the money and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So, from now on she was -- she was handling this, and I was to get myself back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , before the people -- and I had people whom I knew from -- from before the war, most accountants I knew, and they knew me and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So it’s all cloc pretty well. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We somehow man -- and Roomkofsky came after awhile, it didn’t take long, I was there, and he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So I told him, Mr. Roomkofsky, mis -- [indecipherable] I think we called him, “It will be straightened out. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Let me get to him orientity of what is, and I will assure you after I finish, I will be able to tell you that everything works.” </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Turned around, went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I started to organize the things, organize the people to work and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And 19- going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Roomkofsky</span> as a person, as a character, what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">In 1942, he sent us in 5,000 from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and 5,000 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and 5,000 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And then another transfer to 5,000 from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Most of them exsembly rich people. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">The lagers we told this what they had, this is the first time they had, they came in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So, had to find to do something and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Among them was a Mr. Hirsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Mr. Hirsch was on the -- on the board of most of the heavy industry in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , a great lawyer with a big <span class="BUILDING">legal office</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And he was a sick man. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Now, I tried to help him as much as you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">At the same time we were getting in potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">My [indecipherable] always. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">You know that from the farmer to get permission for one shipment of -- of -- of potatoes, with the same permission we get five, six, seven, eight shipments of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So the whole night we are working, and I was working with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We are working with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand wagon</span> what they pushed, what they pulled, and so on there, but they -- just to get away from the -- from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">At the same time, I had to watch to make Roomkofsky satisfied too, that -- that I am not problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Among these people, as I say, was a Mr. Hirsch, extremely wealthy man, and Mr. Hirsch showed me, “Mr. Klipp, when the war ends, half what I have is yours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So I thought myself, first let’s survive, and then we’ll talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Then, as -- so, what I do with these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So, there was a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> in the corner of the fiflagunsaftargum,, there was a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I put in in this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> , and -- and there I -- I working five people, Mr. Hirsch was among them, who couldn’t do anything else, they were not used to anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Everybody had their pencil with the pad and sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And nobody knew about this arrangement, the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Mr. Roomkofsky discovered it one time when he was down there, gwaiting to corner. “</span><span class="sentence" id="545">Hey, hey,” comes in there, “what is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">What are the people doing here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So I tell him, “Present, they are waiting for the soup.” </span><span class="sentence" id="548">He looked at me, turned around, went out without saying a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So, I had to -- so Iam almost legal with them -- having them. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So they were work over there, and were -- they sitting there hours, and waiting for the soup, then the soup came, then they went, and they sit -- went to their families, to the qualas, wherever they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">This was going on for [indecipherable] Roomkofsky, his reaction, what a deleeng I told him they wait for the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">This was for him -- and this told me a lot about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He wanted to -- I knew about him more than I knew him, what I hear, these activities and -- in -- in -- in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for children with their parents, all kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">In the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> -- I was actually in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in different part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So at one time he -- he called me, and he said look, here 1s a big -- here 1s a family what the father’s going into the army, and he has a family of small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">If I take care of the smallest, he will take care of the bigger ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He -- a deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So I say, I’ll put in the smallest children in the order of [indecipherable] and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Anyway, this -- this worked pretty good with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">This went on until -- and yeah, and -- and every day Mr. Shrink was coming, collecting the -- the -- the -- the Polish money, take away the order. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">At the same time Mr. Meemorf, who was before the war a coffee merchant, a big coffee merchant, and he created for himself, after the war he should have something too. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So he was sending in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> things like cacao, tea, rice, something like it -- it was -- what he couldn’t touch, and told not to touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And whatever a transport came in of his things, the following day he was in, and I had to give him a report what I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Match a long paper, everything was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It always match. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">But, I had people with epidamia, dysentaria, all

<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">We were all part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme</span> , all the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Followed him back to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And turned out to be they had a few machines working

go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I was working on this type of machines five at a time, and I knew the machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Because the Poles came, and they were going hiding, and I worked for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">So they gave me a piece of bread once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So- then -- so I come there, and then -- and they’re stuck in the work, and they couldn’t make them, and the master comes up, and his eyes, you could see right away, he’s not a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And he told me, “You know how to work these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I say, “Yes, I know.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Do you know how to work one machine?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I say yes. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Go work.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I went,

class="sentence" id="1193">So then I didn’t see him, this friend of my, I seen him for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">One time I ge -- daytime, an SS man came in to the
