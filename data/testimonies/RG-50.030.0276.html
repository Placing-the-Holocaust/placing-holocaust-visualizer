<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you be so kind to tell us your name, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s David Wasserman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  When and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City Focsani</span> (ph) in March 14, 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Please tell us a few words about your family, what was the profession of your parents, and your years during your childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, although I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Focsani</span> , we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My parents -- my father had a <span class="BUILDING">wine store</span> , and my mom was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I had two little brothers, they were twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And we lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from 1937 until 1932, the day of my deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium Comanesti</span> , which is a <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And there was no visible anti-Semitism at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I'm talking about '37, '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Of course, this changed later on in 1939, 1940 when the political situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> changed to the extreme right. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And then the anti-Semitism was more copious. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The Jewish people were actually expelled from <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We didn't have the right to study anymore, to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I began to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we didn't have any <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">In order to go to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , we had to go to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botosani</span> , which was 40 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So when I was expelled from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was very tragic moment in my life because I thought I had good friends with which I had been studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And at the time when we were told that the Jewish people had no more rights to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was chased out and beaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  When did this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  That happened in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was very depressed, and I was teenager at that time, and I was very depressed, as I said, by the fact that so quickly it can changed, the situation and the hate toward us for the only reason we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">This is a sad memory in my life pertaining to my education, so I just couldn't finish all my education at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I finished about, at that time, there was the fourth grade of Gymnastum Comanesti, which is equivalent of eighth grade here or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Can you be so kind to describe to us a little bit, elaborate a little bit on what happened to you during the days when you were expelled from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  When I was expelled from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my colleagues were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we were actually had to go to our own with tutoring. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I mean we just hired a tutor and he in his spare hours brought us up and updated to the education which we didn't have a chance to follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I just didn't lose too much in education because I just did it on my own, but many of my colleagues didn't have the kind of ambition which I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And then we had to go and perform various sort of work in order to maintain the sustaining a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Did you go every day 40 kilometers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botosani</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  No, I didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botosani</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I did it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> with a private tutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That's what I just mentioned because it was too far away, and we didn't have the money to spend to go every day for 40 kilometers, or to stay there would have been an additional burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">There were three children in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we just couldn't afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But I did it on my own, and I tried - at that time we didn't know how long it would take this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We hoped it was going to be a transitory period where Jewish people would be readmitted in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But the truth was that the situation got worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The Iron Guard and and all this political advance, the worse part in 1939 was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I witnessed, actually, the first aspects of the war when the Polish people were coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modohn</span> and passing through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So our condition and situation was very bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Let me ask you another question before we move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Do you have any recollections on the program of the local the summer of 194 --
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Can you give us a description of what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> , what you had seen...
ANSWER:  What happened is the Rumanian troops were on the retreat from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> , and there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> , it was the borderline, actually, where the Russians were supposed to occupy. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And the Rumanian troops had to give to the Russians this <span class="REGION">territory</span> based on understanding between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but this is a different point of discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And they were very bitter about that in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and on their way back they passed through the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I was in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at that time when I heard shooting on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">People were running and they were saying, "Hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Go and hide because they are shooting the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I just couldn't comprehend at that time what happened, why they are shooting the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And so we were hiding, and through the <span class="DLF">window</span> we peered and we saw the soldiers pointing and inquiring where the Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we were very much afraid that they would come and shoot us right in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They were shooting through the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and that action actually, it happened when there was a funeral in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> near to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> where a Jewish soldier actually was killed in the retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And they burying him with honors and while being the funeral -- in the process of the funeral, the soldier killed everybody who was at the cemetery. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And after that they went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , killing the rest of -- as many people they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There was not the regiment which was actually stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> , it was just a passerby regiment, I don't remember what name it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  But belonging to which army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  The Rumanian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We didn't have the Germans at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So and after they passed, the next day we just went out, and we found out about the atrocities which happened in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and in some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">This I remember from my own, nobody has to tell me because I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was at that time 16 years -- 15 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Could you tell us what happened to you and your family when the military operations against Soviet Union started in June 1941?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  In June 1941, it started already to aggravate our situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">First of all, there were orders to take away the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> from the Jewish people and it was a process of nationalization or Rumanization where my father had to give away the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and many of the Jewish merchants. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And we had to move out from that <span class="NPIP">location</span> and move to a different <span class="NPIP">location</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Can you elaborate a little bit on what happened to the business of your father . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  It was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My father had to train first a certain individual who eventually took over the business without any compensation. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And because we lived with our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the same address, we had to move out. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And we moved to another <span class="DLF">street</span> , a much smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which we couldn't really afford anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We didn't have any income. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">There was no welfare or things like that there, and you had to live on your own or family or friends who wanted to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We didn't have too much help, just a little bit of saving that we had that we had to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And later on we heard that there's going to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but because of the situation and the position of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> , we didn't have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> to accommodate the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So we were locked in our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and we were permitted only one hour a day to go and <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">bazaar</span> , to the open <span class="BUILDING">bazaar</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">From 8 to 9 1n the morning, that was the hour when Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> could actually go and <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And at that particular time the prices were so high because nobody else went to buy from 8 to 9 from the Rumanian population. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And the prices were high, were speculative. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And not only that, I remember that walking in those <span class="DLF">streets</span> , we were actually beaten and spit upon by our neighbors actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">That was the tragedy because we thought that we have good friends and good neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But all of a sudden, this condition changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So we had to run to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in one hour and run back. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Go to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , there was no <span class="BUILDING">supermarkets</span> or grocery like now -- we had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> to buy the food and vegetables and the meat and then the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So many times, like myself and my dad and mom, had to go in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> so we can have our products. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">This I remember also. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So it was very sad that we had to go through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And in 1941 -- coming back to your question -- 1941 was the first deportation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> where people were told that -- at that time <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was occupying a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> by pushing the Russians back. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And the <span class="REGION">territory</span> from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> was given to the Rumanian administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And the Rumanian government of at that time said that all the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> to be deported to these <span class="REGION">territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Unfortunately, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> was attached geographically, either by mistake or intentionally or because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> was a part of the <span class="REGION">Dorohoi County</span> , so they took the whole county of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and attached to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">If I remember it was Gogorno Alexandra (ph), and he gave the orders that all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> , and since the order was specifically to deport all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> who was in the old regard, regard, was included in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And, therefore, we had the unfortunate situation to be considered as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Now, the hate against Bucovina Jews was so much because they thought and they said that the Jews were shooting at the Rumanian Army at the time when they had to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">In my opinion, that is a big lie because the Jewish people -- I know the Jewish people locally, they would never go and shoot -- they would never have arms to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">They would never shoot at the Rumanian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Rumanian -- I mean, Jewish people were in the Rumanian Army, and after that were expelled from the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So that was just a motive to go and kill and deport the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  You mentioned the first deportation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Were you part of this first...
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  But did you witness it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Well, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> , and they took at random, actually -- they took at random people, and they brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And there was an action for I think a day or two when it stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  In November 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">November or December, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So 1t was in wintertime already, and after that we continued our traditional life there like before. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were actually violated by many local population, although there was order not to steal, but everybody went there and took their things, because every Jew who was deported could not take more than one bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We didn't have suitcases in those days; it was a rucksack. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Something in a bag, and whatever you could take in one bag, that's what you were allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So the rest of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were completely intact and would remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So we realized what happened then, and we didn't know exactly where the people go and what they had when transmitted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But we thought that we are better off than they are because we were still in our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And this was my first witness of the deportation of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Of course, 1942 came when we were deported, so rumors were after that that the whole population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> would be transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We didn't have any kind of communication with those people, and we didn't know exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But the rumors came through the Rumanian soldiers coming back from the <span class="DLF">front line</span> that the Jews are actually killed, and, hopefully, nobody will be alive, that's what they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And they considered the Jews as proselytes, and, therefore, have to be eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">In 1942 when the deportation came and we knew that we're going to have the same fate as the other ones, we tried to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But we were actually denounced by one of the neighbors, and we were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The police very brutally beat my dad, and we were taking each one a bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And my little brothers took some toys with them, and we were placed in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> until they collected more Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And after that, we were transported to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and placed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And that was another disastrous event, this story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  When did this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  This happened in June 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Can you describe how you were transported by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> from where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  This is a really sad story because they locked us in in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And we were pressed against each other there, and just locked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Just locked in and left us there the whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were there in the day, and we were staying there all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And the people were screaming and knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> to let us out for personal necessities. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">There were Rumanian soldiers who were guarding us, and they threatened that if we really scream or so, they were going to shoot us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So what I remember the stench, the urine all over, and all the bodily wastes 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was absolutely disastrous. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I believed that we were going to die that night without knowing where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So in the morning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved and we stopped in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> -- I don't know exactly where it was -- but they let us go out for necessities. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And even then, we were told that we have to be in a <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> close so that they can be watching us, the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And everybody, men and women, had to perform their bodily function in front of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That was one of the worst degradations which I saw at that time through the eyes of a teenager, which I couldn't comprehend really. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Water -- at the same time, there was a well of water there, and we were running to the water to fill in some bottles that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , beaten for no reason, and locked in again in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And we were traveling for two nights, and when we arrived we saw that it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , which I knew that was 60 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So what was the purpose of running with us for two nights, two days? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Well, perhaps they wanted really to punish us in any way, possible way they could at a local level. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I remember there was instruction from the Chief of Police was Mr. McCure (ph), which I remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He was a very bad guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Either he gave the instruction to do this for us or instruction above his head, I don't know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But anyway, once we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , we looked at each one, and we just couldn't believe what we see. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Men unshaved and women with their hair and shaven and all these things, and it was really a tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So we were placed on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , and we were told that we are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sagaguda</span> (ph) which was a suburban location near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> through the <span class="DLF">local streets</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I don't know if you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And we went through the <span class="DLF">local streets</span> and we were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sagaguda</span> (ph) where we met other Jewish people there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> who were also prepared to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">That was another question. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Their authorization was not respected, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We spoke to people there, the authorization you took them from their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , there was not our case anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sagaguda</span> (ph), we were permitted for the first time to go to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and to wash our faces, which we realized how little it takes to degrade a person and to lower the morale, and just be happy to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sagaguda</span> together with the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , the Jewish people, we were transported to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stadium of Maccabi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There...
QUESTION:  Wait, where are they sending you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">There we were actually going through a kind of customs regulation, so-called, where we were told to give all our money and to be exchanged for Deutsche marks, German marks which were the currency in effect in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They were not Rumanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And we were paid a certain amount of money, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And the rest of them and all of us, we were told that from that point we will go over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> to <span class="REGION">Transnistria territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There is another tragedy there because when we arrived at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> , they placed us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboats</span> , no <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We're just in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> had two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and they pushed -- I don't know -- 10, 12 people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And they were rowing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">In the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the soldiers said if we were not giving them any kind of valuables we had with us, they will by mistake overturn the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So people were panicking and whatever they had -- pens or fountain pens or watches or rings were given the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And, finally, they brought us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">When everybody came in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> - when everybody was over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> already, we were left in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And luckily for us there was no rain or any kind of weather, which would have really been to our disadvantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So we slept on the <span class="DLF">field</span> until the next day when they told us that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> will come and pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Already we were afraid of all these things and the conditions, but we have no choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Do you remember the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> (ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  So let's continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  And the next day after we slept -- after we slept overnight <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , they packed us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> 1n exactly the same conditions which we were afraid of would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But the distance wasn't very great probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We arrived, I think the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And we were brought to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cayara di Piatra</span> (ph) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liége</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It's a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We understood at that time that this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was a former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> for the Soviet Union, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> for their inmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Can you tell us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cayara di Piatra</span> (ph) means in English when translated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cayara di Piatra</span> (ph) means <span class="DLF">stone caves</span> where people used to break the stones and use them for construction, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  And this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  We did perform any work there, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">There was a Rumanian officer, I don't know the name of this guy, there was a very discouraging speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They told us that he has orders or information or anything to do with us, and we would stay there indefinitely and probably were going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">That was the welcome speech which he gave us, so they placed us in the long <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And we were there for about four weeks, four, five weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And the only thing -- there was no food, and it was just by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We could go and wash ourselves in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Do you remember the month?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  The month? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Yeah, it was July -- end of June or July because it happened really immediately after our deportation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So the officer told us that he will make a favor and permit the local farmers to come on a specific day of the week to give us -- to sell us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And we had to arrange with them whatever we can on a barter exchange or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And for that accommodation he asked for some kind of compensation, which one of the people became a léguer (ph) and went to collect whatever we had to give it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So after about four, five weeks we were there, we just didn't have any more what to exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And we figured out that since there's no other food and no other provision, we are going to die, especially the farmers told us that in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> died many people before we arrive there. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So there was no secret at all that our fate would have been just to die there. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">One day, it was in August, a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German car</span> arrived with SS officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They had a skull and the bones and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And they ordered the Rumanian officer to summons us and bring us up for counting, so we were counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The counting was just a regular routine, and they told us that they need workers for them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they promised us good accommodations and good food in exchange for work, which it sounded very good at that time in our condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And we just kind of accepted this offer, we had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Either we die there or we go and work and getting something for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Little as we knew at that time what the Germans were actually doing and what they did with the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So the next day was a program to transport us to the Germans, which the Rumanian officer told us that the next day we're going to be ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So they brought some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> -- again, horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> for the bags that we each one had, and the people had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Where, we didn't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We were told that we were going to a point where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> will wait for us to bring us to the various <span class="NPIP">locations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So the guards were Lithuanian, which were by themselves were very bad people, and they supervised us to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And we were walking and they ordered us to walk faster and faster and running. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">There were some people there, there were elderly people, there were women, there were children; they couldn't run. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So some people fainted or were exhausted and they fell to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , which we witnessed and we were actually told to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We heard some shots, we assumed they were warning shots for the people to run faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But when we arrived at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> we realized that those people who fell didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">There were some questions, where were those people? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They said they would bring them later with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And when we came there and we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> lined up, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And we were told to go and pick up our belongings which were in a big pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And each one tried desperately to pick up their own bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They gave us half-hour to identify our bag and take possession of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And there was really -- terrible sad how people were actually jumping on each other to just pick up the bags and find them and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We heard laughing, we saw people photographing us, and finally we were pushed in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We tried to keep together, my parents and my brothers because they were taking just people and pushing them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> without relation or family connection or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So we tried to keep together and we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we were pushed in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- I don't remember how many territory people in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , the Lithuanian, the same guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And we crossed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">For the first time we saw a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and we were told by them that we're going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giessen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It meant nothing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When we arrived there and we saw already the condition there. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We saw the people that were in the same condition as we were when we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And we realized that this is going to be our future, and forget about the good food and the -- giiten essen, giiten flagel (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We used to say good food and good accommodation. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in, and we were waiting to be tried and brought over. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">After a wait for about 15, 20 minutes, they came and they told us that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was full and they had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for us anymore and they have to bring us to a different <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> turned around, and we moved back to the same <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And on the way back, I witnessed -- we witnessed a really big tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Because there was a beautiful young girl about maybe 15 or so, and the Lithuanian were looking at her all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And finally the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stopped in the middle of nowhere, and they pulled her out, both she and her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They both starting to scream, terrible, and they raped her, all four guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So when she came back, she looked terrible, poor girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">She was one of our group which eventually -- I want to relate -- eventually she was killed later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But this is later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Sorry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So when we were brought back almost the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> as we start, and crossing back the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> , little as we know -- little as knew at that time that that was our chance to survive the Holocaust 1s because we did not -- we were not admitted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giessen Camp</span> , where we found out that nobody survived in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Everybody was shot and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So we were brought back over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> back, and we were told that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we are there, it's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> , which, again, meant nothing to us at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">In this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with about 2,000 people that we lived, they had two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camps</span> run by the Tort Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">One camp was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dortmund Camp</span> , we found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And the other one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Herzogenbusch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We were placed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Herzogenbusch Camp</span> , all together were about 2,000 people, and ours was the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which we realized later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And when we were brought there, the same thing like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giessen</span> , the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> with the same unfortunate people which we saw already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And we realized that those were people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> , Jewish people who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> and in the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And they were the first to be locked in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So when we came in, we saw all the Lithuanian guards there. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">A whole army, I mean just many, many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And they said that this is going to be our place of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They put us in <span class="DLF">line</span> , they counted us again, and then they told us that we are going to be separated men from women. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They would be given separate <span class="INT_SPACE">dormitories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And the sanitary facilities was an open <span class="DLF">trench</span> where men and women together had to use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">The degradation was getting from bad to worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We were told by the German commander that this is the place where we're going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We are going to work six days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We are going to walk to work about five, six kilometers, I believe it was the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And they expect us to perform to their standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And if not, then we're going to pay with our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The food rations was a half a bread per person per week distributed on a Sunday when we were not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Every morning we used to get a cup of hot water called tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I think they put some branches and leaves from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">local trees</span> , no sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And at work we used to get a soup a day at noontime, mostly peas. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I ate so much peas in those years and no meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , back walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we got the same ration as in the morning, a cup of hot water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  What kind of work did you perform there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  We broke stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We went again to a Cayara di Piatra (ph), where we really had to work at the stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Where -- the purpose of this work really, we realized after a year and a half of working there, we realized that those stones practically never used, but were only a reason for killing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Because if you didn't perform -- the Germans used to measure the cubic feet of stones, how much each one is supposed to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And if you didn't make it, they marked you down and the which they had, the first of the people -- the first one was the one who did not perform the standard. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The women had to break stones with a small hammer about half a kilogram. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The men had to work with big hammers about 10 pounds, which I was considered a man, although I was not really a full power man. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But I had to perform with a big hammer which I really didn't know how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">By chance, sheer luck, we were together with the Russian prisoners who worked in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They were Russian prisoners who were captured by the Germans and placed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They had much conditions than we had because they had visitors, the local farmers could bring them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They were permitted to fish in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> because it was just by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The Jewish people were not permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The most that we could do was just wash our feet, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And, as I said, so they helped me by breaking some stones and putting into my <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it has to be measured until I learned how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">You had to take the stone and go like a piece of wood, and just knock the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it broke -- the stone and then the stone broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And sometimes we had to just take the stones and bring them to the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Women has to perform their duties also. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And that was a routine work for us for all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The half- hour of time for food was just mostly was for relaxation, just to breathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And they were very bad because the extra food -- I remember, the extra food which remains in those big canisters, they were actually thrown into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> after they gave to each one, the one whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And when people asked for extra, they didn't really want to give us. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They spilled it in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And then we had to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">How we survived really, I have to say that we were just lucky that the local farmers, which we didn't know them really very much, they tried to help us as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And they had a <span class="BUILDING">sugar factory</span> close to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> there, and they were transporting the sugar beets from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And they were pushing the sugar beets on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And when we walked, each one like wild animals went there to collect a beet or something, and those beets were our supplement provision, which we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">In addition to that, the local farmers used to throw potatoes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So we found them, we ate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Many times we ate them raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But this was a time that either you didn't -- you were not very choosey what you eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And automatically people were killed in those <span class="NPIP">places</span> by not performing to their standards, and they used to come periodically in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> and select people. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The commander used to have them already marked, people who did not perform because they didn't want to run with a half a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So they lined us up, they counted to 10, and the 10th person was taken out regardless, whether they are good worker or anything, and taken out and we never saw those people again. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So they were actually killed at random. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Some other times they used to pick out the fifth or the seventh so you never knew that the 10th is always picked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So you never knew when it was going to be your day to be killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  Do you remember the names of the people in charge in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  Yeah, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  German officers or petty officers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  There a guy there -- you see, that the Tort Organization, which had this jurisdiction over our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , they were not SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They were just -- I don't know what kind of -- auxiliary army. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They wore some brown khaki uniform, not **marked, not a green one or SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And the commander who was in charge of day-to-day activity and day-to-day killing was a guy named Karl Rheinger (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He, although he was not an SS, he enjoyed very much to have this kind of jobs and the opportunities to come and kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He killed personally people which I'm going to tell you later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And together with Mikel Cromer (ph), which was an SS policia, the auxiliary SS who actually was the commander, the field commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I don't know exactly what grade the rank was. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And he was responsible for the SS people, but Karl Rheinger was in charge of the day-to-day operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Later one we had another German guy, SS policia, his name was Tomachek (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="337">He was just a great guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I have to say that he saved actually lives which I'm going to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It's a lot of story which I can tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">In our <span class="NPIP">place</span> if anybody tried to escape and escaped, 10 people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And this we knew and they told us that we have to watch each other should not escape because if this guy will escape then 10 of us will die. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So in addition to the selection at random, in addition to not performing to the standards, we had to think of 10 people to die for one who escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Well, I remember a sad story about the six people who were actually killed in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They escaped and at the morning count when they saw that the six people are missing Karl Rheinger told us that when we come back, 60 would be shot and now go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So can you imagine how we did work on that day? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">How we did walk to the <span class="BUILDING">working place</span> thinking that when we come back, 60 people would be dead, and so you couldn't help it really. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So that day they came at lunch hour and they picked out 10 -- no, they picked out six men from our ranks from the work, and they were crying and begging for their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They thought that, and we thought that they changed their minds and instead to kill 60, they would just kill the six. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And they took them -- there was real tragedy the way they were screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And they took them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they told them to dig a <span class="DLF">grave</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , just outside the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And they did thinking that this is that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I mean this is normal to think that if you don't see anybody and you know that six people were away and you know that you are selected, so you think that you will die. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And those six people after they finished the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , they saw the six people who ran away being brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Those people were disrobed, were naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">The original six people were caught on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and brought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">This nobody knew at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And they made them run through the barbed wire where they escaped naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There were four women and two men. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And instinctively they covered their private parts and they didn't let them. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They told them to run with their hands up. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And they were brought and placed in the <span class="DLF">grave</span> face down, and the Lithuanian had the opportunity to kill them one by one, which they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  Do you remember the names of these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  The Lithuanian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I mean asking about the victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I remember the name of the victims because we worked together with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Well, let me tell it to finish that story is that one of the ladies who were shot and those people were throwing the soil on top of them, she realized apparently that she was not dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And she got up and she begged the Commandant Karl Rheinger to spare her life, and he actually took his pistol and shot her personally and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So the name of the people, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">There was a couple, their name was Mr. and Mrs. Ganzer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Another lady was Mrs. Rosenbaum. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The other lady was Mrs. Gotismann (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="374">There was a guy, his name was Mr. Goldschmidt; he was a musician I remember in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> because I used to walk with him to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And another young lady who her parents were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I don't remember the last name, I remember the first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was Gusta (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And unfortunately those people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I did not relate this event to a previous event where the husband of Mrs. Gotismann was killed previously in the winter of 1942 when Karl Rheinger came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the middle of the night, and he told us to run around the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Just to run, just to entertain him. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And shots were heard, and we didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So when we were pushed back in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and each one knew each other, Frau Gotismann realized that her husband is not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">By the way, he a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">It's not important really, but he was a dentist, a professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And she knocked on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and asked for her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And she was told to keep quiet or she will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So in the morning, she asked again, and he told her the same thing so she kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">That was the same Frau -- I say Frau, Mrs. Gotismann who actually decided to run away and she was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The other lady, Mrs. Rosenbaum, had an unfortunate situation with her husband previously had a mental breakdown, and he started to scream day and night and he was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Again, she felt like doesn't have anything to live for, and she was one of the people who got together to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">The couple of Mrs. and Mrs. Ganzer, I remember them very well because they two little girls, twins like my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And their daughters together with my brothers were killed and they felt again that they have nothing to live probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And they tried to take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Now, Goldschmidt, he was a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He was very depressed because the Germans crushed his accordion, and for a musician it is terrible thing, apparently, to have this done to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And again he was very weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He was very weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I used to walk with him, and he used to tell me story. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I believe he told me that he came to look for some relatives, and he was caught in the avalanche and brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And the other lady, the young lady Gusta, which I don't remember the last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I am very good with names, but I don't remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I was not very familiar with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Her parents were also killed previously, and she was all alone and she also tried to escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I related the tragedy of the six people before the story which I have to tell, but that affect us personally when my little brothers were taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  How old they were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  They were seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">They were twins, and they were seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">That happened September 23rd, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It was two day after Yom Kippur, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">It's a Jewish holiday, Day of Atonement. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And from the time we arrived in August until September, they had time to analyze us and prepare listing so everybody who they intend to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Incidentally, when we arrived there one of the people who were inmates told my dad that the next day when they will ask you the name and how old you are, be sure that you say that you less than 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Because they kill everybody who is older than 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">My father was 45 at that time, and my mom was 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">See, at this age you can you are 37 or 36, but people who are 50 or 60 it's very hard to cheat to say that you're 39, so they were doomed. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So sure enough, when they asked the name, " ." </span><span class="sentence" id="417">how old you are and what is your name, my parents told them 38, 35, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">My brothers couldn't say because they killed everybody who was, I believe, less than 14 -- 13 or 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So when the first in September 23rd, 1942, my brothers and Ganzers' children altogether I think there were about 60 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">60 or 80 children, I don't remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Together with elderly people over 40 and the people who did not perform to their standards for that prior month, and they were taken up on the <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We were told to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">My mom didn't want to leave the children, so she just run because they actually threw the children under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">The practically threw them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">My mom, I remember, she just was desperate and tried to go after the children, and they beat her actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So we walked and on the way to work, we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with the kids and everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So it was very sad really. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">It's so many years since that time, but I still cannot forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Of course, we never saw anybody of this group and not my brothers and nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And for all those years while my parents were alive, my mother hoped that the children are still alive somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Maybe they were adopted, maybe they were somehow saved by somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We made the request to the Red Cross after the war, but we didn't find -- but now I found out that they were killed on the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And so my parents didn't know when they died what happened to their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I can tell stories and stories what happened on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We would like to know what was life on a daily basis in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Our life was very bad because we came to a point when we didn't have any more, any clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And it was very important to keep warm because if you get cold, you get a cold, a regular cold and you stayed for two days not working, you were marked down and you were taken to the first next exeoni (ph), which was about every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So we had to keep warm, and we had to keep working. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I don't recall of any day we didn't -- we missed a day's work. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Not my mom and dad, and not myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">That was probably one of luckiest parts of not having to be taken out and sent to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they used to shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But periodically they were bringing people 1n those <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and periodically they were killing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They were bringing people who were already weak, and they could not really work to the standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And they were eliminated in the first months. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And we couldn't help anybody, anything to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">If you cannot go, if you are sick and have high temperature, you just cannot go and walk five kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So you just wait for them kill you and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I mean that was a very desperate situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The reason that we really supported that is I can say that my mamma should have some peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">She was very optimistic and she used to say that we will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And people thought that mom was maybe out of her mind in thinking that we can ever, every going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">But I believed her and said that eventually we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">You know, when you're in a condition like that and you lose your courage, you've lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">You have to be courageous, but it's very hard in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So that when I think back really, if I would have to go through this again, I probably wouldn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So we were Just practically naked, and my mom made for me a pair of socks from an empty bag of potatoes which used to be thrown away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Potatoes, peas. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So I had a pair of pants made of a bag, and I didn't have any shoes, so I had rags wrapped around my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I had one day my nose and face frozen, and I could see my nose getting white and they told me that even my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So I remember that I thought that I'm going to have a <span class="DLF">hole</span> where my nose is, and I'm going to be disfigured. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And my dad rubbed my face with snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He said don't touch with your hands because you may damage your skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And we were walking in any weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Rain or snow or frost. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I remember some days the Bug was frozen, and the Germans didn't feel like walking so they brought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And they packed us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they drove across the Bug just on the ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And we were afraid that if something happened, we are going to be the first to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But it was such a tremendous frost, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with all those people crossed over and it didn't break. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So in this type of condition we had to come back and those days, we couldn't collect any beets from the <span class="DLF">road</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So we had to really be satisfied with what we had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  Really, you would be surprised how little you need to survive if your mind is there and hope for the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">This is -- the story is repeated every day, the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And there was cases when they were beating their -- a guy who stole from somebody else something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  So you stayed for the whole period of the war under German administration under the Tort Organization Administration?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Until end of December 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">At that time there was another important day in our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We were told that the Rumanian Jews will go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">By the way, we didn't have any information about what happened at the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We realized later that the Germans started to get beaten, and the Russians starting an advance toward their own, recapturing their own <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And the order came that the Rumanian Jews will be readmitted to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">When we were told that, we just didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We didn't believe it for the only reason that 1t was not believable that we should go back while the war is still on. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And, by the way, we were only 27 survivors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> , and the only survivors from any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor concentration camp</span> was by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I know for a fact now; at that time we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Nobody survived from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Our lucky day was at that time was when we were not admitted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giessen</span> and we were brought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Although we were under German jurisdiction for all this time, but we were on the <span class="REGION">Rumanian territory</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> , the Rumanian commander, receiving orders probably from the high command, was searching for as many Rumanian Jews as they possibly can find. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And they requested the German commanders to look and find out if there is any Rumanian Jews there, and they were told there were 27. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Apparently, the Germans could have very easily say that they don't have anybody from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , but they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So at that day when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came in, the same type of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and they called out names. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And they told us the Rumanian Jews should step out from the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We thought that this is the end of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We thought that this 1s the time when now the Rumanian Jews are specifically chosen to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And there was really, I remember crying and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">But, at the same time, we were already hardened, and said, "Well, if we have to die, we have to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">What can we do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So we were placed in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , the 27 people, and taken out and waving to the other people because I have to say that the Czernowitz Jews and Ukrainian Jews who were with us, they remained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I believe that there were about a hundred or so people still there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  If my understanding is correct, they tried to bring back only the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  Right, only from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> and from the and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oder</span> and they tried to correct some kind of misunderstanding what happened for so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Anyway, so when we were placed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and driven, I remember there was fork in the <span class="DLF">road</span> to the right, used to go over the Bug to the <span class="REGION">German territory</span> where everybody was executing in those <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We knew where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were going when they used to take the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But in the left side of the fork was the direction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> , which was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in that <span class="REGION">area</span> which was completely administrated by the Rumanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So I personally remember I closed my eyes and tried to figure out what I'm going to fork, to the right or to the left when I know where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> is going. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">When I realized that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> really go to the left, maybe -- we said maybe this is true, that we'll be going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And sure enough, we were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> , I think 19 or 20 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  When did this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  That happened in the end of December 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And once we were there, we saw Rumanian soldiers and we didn't see Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So anything we thought is going to be better than with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But the Rumanians in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> , the officer took us out and made a speech for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And he said, "Now you are here, and if anybody will say something what happened to you, will be shot on the spot." </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And so here we are, out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Here we are, hopefully, going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we're going to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I mean, speak to whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">To what? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I mean, we didn't understand what was the purpose of this speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So they told us you are going to be disinfected and shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So everybody was shaved up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Men and women naked went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> , and the clothing was taken to a <span class="BUILDING">disinfection place</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So we went naked into that <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We didn't know what happened to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We were so happy because that was actually the first time in almost those two years that we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So the men and women together were actually put in the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and the water was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But after so many months and years of degradation, people didn't really mean anything to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We didn't mean that women and men together, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We were happy that we were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So after that, they were really doing bad things to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Because even going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we were forced to go and collect the clothing from the disinfection and the condition where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So, but anyway we took it as it comes as long as we are not killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And from there they told us that we will go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we should forget everything what happened here. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And they brought us to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> again with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And there they -- I don't know exactly the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they brought us, and we were brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">The <span class="DLF">road</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> was almost the same thing as when we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We realized that -- we didn't realize what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Why are we brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the same condition as we were brought in? </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And, but we learned how to wait and have hope and see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So when -- making a long story short, when we were brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> and we saw the name of the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , we were extremely happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were still locked, and the same police officer, McCure, was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And he didn't open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> for us, and we were there I think the whole night again until the next morning when we were transported with some horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And since nothing changed politically in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> at that time, we were brought to the same condition as actually when we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">We could not really go to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because they were occupied by local population there. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So we were accommodated to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> where they transformed in a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And we slept in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for all those months until the Russians actually broke through. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I don't remember what month it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">February or March 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And at that time many Rumanian families evacuated, being afraid of the Russians, apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So then we found our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but it was empty because the people who lived there took everything out and moved before the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So really our condition didn't change too much, but one of our friends told us to live in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he is leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So he gave us all his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that's where we stayed until in August 1944 when we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Focsani</span> , back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  Let me go back for one second, and ask you about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">You mentioned that during the summer of 1942 you were for a few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  Can you elaborate a little bit on the conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Li¢ge</span> and what kind of people were interned there? </span><span class="sentence" id="561">There were Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> or also Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Do you eventually remember a group of insane people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  Can you tell us about their condition a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  That was really very sad because we were there together with the transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , but also people there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And there were crazy people there who were running around, real crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And we were told that what they did is they brought all the Jewish people from <span class="BUILDING">mental institutions</span> and they were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> to the Cayara di Piatra. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And that was degrading to see how they behaved because they didn't have any food, and they couldn't go and exchange anything and they couldn't go and buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So I personally saw one of those guys eating his own bodily waste. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">It's not a pleasure to recount this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And so when the Germans took us, they didn't take those crazy people, those insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I don't know what happened to them after that, after we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">But they didn't go with us, they remained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I don't want to think of their fate, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I can assume that they were not really cured of something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They killed healthy people, I don't think that they had any remorse in killing those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They were really in terrible shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  Can you tell us, please, what happened to you after the war briefly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  Well, after the war, we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> , and I hated this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I saw the same former colleagues of mine who, when I came in, they were in the Iron Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And they were given the green shirt with a kind of leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And I realized at that time what they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But anyway, so there was not really open anti-Semitism in order to kill us or to be beat us. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There was not those kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Apparently, they realized when they brought us back maybe they don't want us there anymore or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Anyway, so we stayed there because we had to stay because our family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Focsani</span> was under the Rumanian and German occupation, while we were with the Russians until August of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">At that time we decided to leave and we went back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">There when I came, we lived together with one of my mom's sisters and then we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to catch up in my education, and while other people really laughed. "</span><span class="sentence" id="591">What are you trying to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="592">you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So I said, "Well, I lost so many years that I hope that I can catch up and eventually bring myself up to time." </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I went to in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , and I finished part of my education. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And life under the Russian Communist regime was not much, much better than under the Germans, with the exception that they didn't kill you, not shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But I couldn't get a job because my father was a merchant once, and I had to tell the whole story of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And wherever I went I was considered a son of a bourgeoisie. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And I told my parents that I cannot live in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So I decided to go, where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So in 1948 <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was reformed again, and in December 1948 I left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in January 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I was in the Israeli Army for a while, and I was liberated from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I got a job with a Zen Lines Shippers, and I started from scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Bag boy, stewart, storekeeper and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I used my skill and knowledge from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I produced profit and losses and balance sheets and those, which was something new. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, and I was made Chief Steward on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> and a Ship Steward on a passenger -- it was a <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I was purser on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I used to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Ironically, many of our <span class="NPIP">destinations</span> were <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braman & Bramanhoffen</span> (ph) where we used to bring merchandise from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> under the pact of , which means let's make it good. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> received quite a lot of help from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and merchandise and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So I worked for them until 1956, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I married one of my former inmates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">She was a little girl at that time, and I was not very old. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">But that's another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">There was an unfortunate marriage, which I don't want to discuss; it has nothing to do with the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But it's quite interesting, here I start working for <span class="BUILDING">Swiss bank</span> which I start again from fresh as a clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And based on my education and my dedication, I finished up a college equivalency -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> it is banking, and I was promoted to Assistant Vice-President, Vice-President. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">This <span class="BUILDING">Swiss bank</span> is a foreign bank, I don't want to advertise for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">A <span class="BUILDING">foreign bank</span> don't give ranks and definition unless you're really 100 percent, so thank God that I succeeded and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I retired as Vice-President of the controller's area in the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss bank</span> in 1990.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  You're very welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  I would like to go back once more and to kindly ask you to tell us if you remember anything else about your guards, German guards in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Well, besides the Karl Rheinger and the Mikel Cromer (ph) and this time when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at the end we had another commander, SS policia. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">His name was Tomachek. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He was originally from the Sudeten territory of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">It is interesting to mention that they told us their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">The never hoped that we will be alive or anybody will survive, and we knew their name very accurately. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Now, Tomachek was the last commander in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and he was just the opposite of Mikel Cromer, or Karl Rheinger who was a monster. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">But Tomachek, he did his job but he did not really overdo, and not only that he didn't kill us, but he even saved some lives, I might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">There was a time when three people escaped from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and by the rule that for every person 10 people will be shot, so, therefore, we expected another kind of drama that 10 people will disappear in the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But Tomachek brought three people from the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pollkulla</span> (ph), which was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumanian jurisdiction camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> where the people were left to starve and die. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And they brought those three people in a very bad condition, I remember they were swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I didn't know at that time that people who don't eat, before they die their bodies swell up. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They get so swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And he actually had them there for the count, and with the soup that we got which was much more than they got in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pollkulla</span> and they recovered somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And for a while they were kept in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> didn't work, and they were not shot really. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Now, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> after the war and my parents and I were called to the <span class="BUILDING">German Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and we were asked if we knew anything about a German whose name was Tomachek. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And we said yes, we knew about him, and we had wanted to say good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And my parents and I signed a proxy, whatever you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">A deposition on his behalf that he didn't kill anybody in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">We said that we don't know what he did in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> if he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But as we know his character, I believe that he never killed anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So we just made a deposition on his behalf and I hope that he was acquitted if there was any trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  So if I understand you well, he replaced those people who escaped with other three inmates from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pollkilla</span> m order to not enforce the crises.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  Correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Because occasionally he got his bosses used to come and count, but there were no names, and there were only numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And actually, in my opinion, he risked his life probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And why he did it, I don't know, but he did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Conclusion of Interview </span>
