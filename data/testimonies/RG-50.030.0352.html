<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Actually, you didn't -- I don't you said your last name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Oh, I'm so sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My family name was Moskovitz (ph) by birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> or you were too young?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My only memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> is really my grandparentsâ€™ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which I am assuming I visited as a young child of three or four. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Came to visit Grandma and Grandpa, and I had uncles and aunts there and spent wonderful times with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Very pampered, very loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It was very, very warm <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I remember my grandfather picking me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">They had this chandelier that hanging with little beads at the end, almost like a little skirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And he used to pick me up so I can touch it and play with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I had really a lot of fond memories just remembering the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and remembering the smells of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and eating and roaming around in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">All of those memories are really kind of in my mind, very wonderful memories of visiting my grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  I have an older brother, who is seven and a half years older than Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And, of course, my older brother played a big role in my life, especially in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">There were just the two of us, and because he was seven and a half years older, he had different interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And aside from trying to pester me because he enjoyed seeing me screaming or laughing or whatever it was, really our relationship was like a younger sibling looking up to almost an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He was -- I almost always admired him, and I was in awe of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He was -- the age differences were so great until we grew up to be adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">In adulthood, now that we are both adults, I consider him my younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Because it turned out that I think I'm the more mature one and he's the softer one. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So it's amazing how the roles switch later on 1n life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  What kind of business was your family in? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Did your parents work, what kind of lifestyle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Well, my father came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He was one of 13 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">There were -- actually, there were 15 children born to that family, and 13 of them grew up to adulthood. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And they were of very modest means. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother came from a much more prosperous background, but at the time of their marriage already times changed for the worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And my grandparents didn't have what they had before, and so they had very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My parents got married and for a while, they had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And then that fizzled away, and that's when they moved back to my grandparents' <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> , where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And from there, they picked up, and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> because there was work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And it turns out that my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> was just a laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They really lived in a very modest, modest life. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They didn't have much, and my mother knitted a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I don't know if she sold some of her knittings or not, but really at that time financially they were considered poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  I want to, I guess, ask you more about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> , because you were so young in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Did you have a sense of whether or not there was a strong <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , if your family was friendly with neighbors who were not Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I know that your family was religious, but I'm trying to get a sense of how they were integrated with community was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  In the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where we lived, it was kind of an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> that the front to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , was a few stories high. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> itself there was like what you would call a <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> , one-level <span class="BUILDING">townhouses</span> today, the attached <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And it kind of surrounded, went like an L-shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And we lived in one of those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Now, we had neighbors, most of them were Jewish neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But we also had the manager of this <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , the manager of that <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> who took care of the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> and took care of the property, and he was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We were very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I remember playing with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I remember them putting up the Christmas tree and me helping hang up the walnuts on the branches of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So the parents were very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We lived in a community where, of course, there were quite a few Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Not Orthodox Jewish families, but modern Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And yet, my parents were always very Zionistic, and they definitely saw to it that in spite of the fact that they didn't have a lot of money, so to speak, they raised us in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">What would be like a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">My brother went to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolozsvar</span> , and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> that belonged to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And so he was already in the upper grades, and I was -- just before we were taken away, I was about to start first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">In the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , of course, we learned about all the holidays and little Hebrew songs and Hungarian songs and dances and they read us stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And everything that at that time they taught in a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I went to that <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> -- in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the children have to wear uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So the uniforms were always navy and a white shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">A navy uniform and a white shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">That was the uniform for the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The boys have to wear hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I think there was Star of David on the hat, if I'm not wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But even if it wasn't, by the time it approached 1943, everybody had to wear the Jewish star, no matter what, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You could not walk out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> without having the Jewish star sewn on your coat or sewn on your jacket or on your dress, depending on the season of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You really had to wear it like a badge on your chest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Were you aware of any attacks, verbal or physical, on your family or on your brother or yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Only on my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I was not much aware of anything that was going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I only was aware of the fact that I was totally forbidden to leave the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I was always warned if I every set foot out of the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , to make sure that I have on me something that has the Jewish star on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Of course, being so young, my mother did not look forward to me setting out my foot outside the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And that's understandable, but that was so impressed on me as a young child that I was really scared to step <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I liked to step <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , because when I stepped outside the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> next door there was a <span class="BUILDING">candle factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I remember looking down there, I was fascinated how they made the candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">How they dipped it in wax with the wicks, you know, up and down going into the melted wax. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I was just fascinated by the whole process. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I looked to sit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you know, kind of stoop down and watch how they were doing those things, but I was really carefully monitored. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I remember my brother coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and there was always an upheaval because he was chastised going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , chastised coming back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; he was taunted. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I must say, I had a very handsome brother that was not even -- initially was very handsome and the uniform looked great. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But there were always -- harangued going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and coming back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and fist fights would ensue coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And also then in those days, people still rode in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and various transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So the kids really walked to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and came back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Nobody had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , so nobody picked the children up. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So it was a natural thing for him to walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And my father was a very ethical and moral man, but to some extent I think was very naive. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he felt that it's unbecoming a Jewish young man to fist fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That this is not something that -- he didn't teach us that, and this against anything that we stand for. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And that either you reason or you talk, but you don't fist fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">You are not a hooligan. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">If you fist fight, then you reduce yourself to the gutter level. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And my brother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day, and he had somebody's footprint on his navy uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Obviously, somebody kicked him in his behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my father got so angry at my brother, and my brother was a very mild-mannered young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But I guess there was just so much taunting that he could take and there on the way, and somebody physically attacked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And somebody kicked him in his behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I think my father added his own hand to teach him not to get into brawls on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, But I remember my brother who was very good at woodwork; he was very artistic young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He paints and he sculpts and he does woodwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He's an extremely talented young -- he was an extremely talented young -- now, he's an extremely talented young adult, older adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I call him young adult, I should really call him older adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I remember him fashioning with -- from little wood, you know, handle and attaching a whip to it that was rolled in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That was his protection going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so if somebody attacks him, he can whip this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And that kind of left a very strong impression on me as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">That and the fact that my father hit him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  So you did become aware at this point that there were problems? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I mean, it was different to be Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Can you remember other lessons you learned from your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You were talking about not to fight or...
ANSWER:  Not really, with the -- I shouldn't say not really, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I think the lessons -- I think the lessons were in spite of all difficulties and in spite the horrendous times, they did not hide who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They kept very strongly the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They made sure that my brother became bar mitzvahed at such a difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I remember my brother's bar mitzvah in the big <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> ; it was almost empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I remember standing in the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogues</span> in those days, the women sat on top on the second level and looked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And the men were downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I remember standing between the <span class="DLF">railing</span> and watching my brother chanting from his Haftorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And no matter what, Passover was Passover; Rosh Hashanah was Rosh Hashanah; the Sabbath was the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">All of those traditions were kept to the bitter end. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Nothing was really hidden away, and I think it gave me a sense of understanding and a sense of also some pride. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I was not hidden way, all of those things were not hidden away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">If anything else, it just made me stronger probably and more believing. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That you just cannot allow anybody to trample over you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  How much was your regular life, as you knew it, disrupted at that point in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It wasn't physically occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">How much did life change? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Were there a lot of restrictions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  There were restrictions on what -- between what hour and what hour you were allowed to go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Jews were not allowed on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at every hour, every day of the -- every hour of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">There were restrictions in terms of how often you were allowed -- between what hour and what hour you are allowed out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I'm sure it was very disruptive to my parents, to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">My father, who was still working at the time, and then later on in '43 was taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My mother being alone with two young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="136"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> ceased to exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> closed, and so we were primarily at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My brother was very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Him and neighbors, they dug up a bunker in the front, in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , because there were a lot of sirens and a lot of running to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> was really not below ground level. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">laundry room</span> type of a thing, where people washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And that was the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I remember that that affected me something fierce as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I was hysterical every time the siren sounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I used to cry and scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I was just so utterly shaken and afraid as a child from all these sounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And that affected me later on in life, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Because for a long time when at that point was silent and not screaming, but when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the sirens were going on because of the War of Independence, and there was never really complete peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was always that panic of will I make it to the shelter or won't I make it to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">That always ensued, and at times it would just be a siren over an ambulance that sounded like a siren. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But once you hear it, it's like it shakes you up completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So...
QUESTION:  Did you maintain a relationship with this family, this Christian family that the man, I guess, was the landlord or the superintendent of your <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , once things got worse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  I think we had a relationship, a cordial relationship in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We were never -- the relationship was never such that we -- they came and visited and us, and ate in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or we visited them and ate in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Those kind of things did not exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But until we were taken away, they lived there and we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And until we were taken away, definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Do you remember your parents talking about what was going on or how they tried to comfort you, or did they explain anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  I don't remember that any of this was discussed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I think my parents probably spoke between themselves, or they spoke to my brother, but none of this was shared with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was -- they felt probably that I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I'm sure those discussions took place between my brother and my mother, especially after my father was taken away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He was the man in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and my mother kind of gave him instructions in case -- the fear was already there that we will be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We will forced out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That we will be forced to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But my mother felt at the time that she needs to prepare my brother, because if she's out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and something happens, then she gave him instructions how to dress me, how many layers of clothing to put on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I know that there was knapsack for each one of us prepared on the side to take with us, the necessities, changes of a few pieces of clothing, and eating utensils made out of something unbreakable. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You know, one of those enamel dishes, and the eating utensils that we have to eat with and things like that were in the knapsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And my mother put in -- I had a little baby umbrella. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was just like a little umbrella with pink roses on it, and she put that in the knapsack, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It was my favorite little toy or whatever, and she put that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And as she feared, that's exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Because she was out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> when they started rounding up all the Jews, and she had to beg for them to allow for her to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because she had two children at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She came back and all we did is pick up the knapsacks, and she took down the Mezuzah from the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">She threw away the casing; she just kept the content, which was a leather parchment about this size. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">This is all. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">She took it with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Already prior to that, she flushed down her diamond in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , because she felt she's not giving it to anyone but she didn't want it to be taken away from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And on a nice April day, they came for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  And this was what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  1944.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">That is something that I learned about it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I yust later on learned that this was a special group, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">A privileged group, that was gathered together, and they supposedly -- this is something that I learned later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">That I had no knowledge of at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">That this group was gathered together, and they collected everybody's belongings and money and jewelry and whatever everybody could offer, because the Germans needed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And Kastner, who was a lawyer, a Hungarian Jewish lawyer, dealt with Eichmann and pleaded with him to save this group of Jews to show to the world that what they are doing is not -- supposedly not happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And because it was towards the end of the war, they were in such terrible need of money that they had accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And this group supposedly was supposed to be transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But instead from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  Do you know how you became a part of this group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Probably because twofold. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">First, my parents were always Zionists, and they were always active in the Zionist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Second, my uncle who was with us, he was a very important banker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolozsvar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">He was wealthy, and he was well-to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And he had more connections, and he put us on the list, together with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And I think that was probably one of the most important things. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But in this group, as I said before, not everyone had a connection, and not everyone was wealthy, it may seem. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">There was a good percentage of them who had the money, but they brought together with them 500 orphan children who did not have anybody to speak for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And so there were many other people in the group, not just those who were privileged to be in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And in those days also, there were many movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">There were many organizations, Jewish organizations, that tried to save Jews in every which way they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And like between all people, there are always differences of opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">There were those who felt you should not deal with Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">There were those who felt you should do whatever you can to save the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">There were those who felt that just something bad will come out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There were those who felt that this is not the way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So even if they knew and they could go on with the group, they did not want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It was a life that was unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Just like Kastner thought that we will all wind up in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , and we wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And he himself, I think, put his life on the <span class="DLF">line</span> every minute of the day when he entered this negotiations and traveled as a Jew all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for meetings and different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">His life was on the <span class="DLF">line</span> constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">His family was just in as much jeopardy as anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And, you know, people claim he should have told everybody what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">He should have let the Hungarian Jewry know what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The documentation shows that there are some people that escaped <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> who came back, and who reported what's going on, who told them what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And nobody would believe them. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Nobody would listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">It's easy to be a good judge, you know, after the fact.</span></p>

modest way. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">My parents were such modest people, and I had never seen adults sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> or doing their thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And I remember somebody either bending down and his glasses fell off their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I remember those glasses falling into the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And, you know, that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Now, you know, in any person who -- this kind of stuck in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And just understanding of what it means for someone who does not see to wear glasses and to lose them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And my mother glasses since she was a little child, so I know that this -- I know that she cannot -- she cannot exist without her glasses, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So that thought left such an impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And the other big impression was when we were taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We were taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and if you can imagine a <span class="DLF">fence</span> that is made out of wooden slats that are very tightly attached to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">We were walking by this <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and people were screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And I remember asking my mother, "Why are they screaming?" </span><span class="sentence" id="420">My mother said to me, "Because they recognize names that were written on the <span class="DLF">fence</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Now, nobody had pens or pencils with them, but people bent down and picked up a piece of rock or chalky substance that was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And they smeared their names in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Or wrote down dates when they were there, in case somebody else will come and recognize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It's that feeling or maybe that faith that knowing that you may be going to your death, that maybe somebody else will come and recognize your name. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Because the entire <span class="DLF">fence</span> was scribbled with names, and people obviously recognized some names on those <span class="DLF">fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Or they didn't recognize, maybe they thought they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">You never know what went on in people's minds, but the fear was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And we were taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> where everybody had to get undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And I remember the horror for the first time in my life, that I have seen adults naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I didn't even see children naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I don't remember if I saw myself naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I was just a little girl, and now I see children and mothers and grandmothers marching around naked into these <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And people were screaming because they obviously did not think that those were showered. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Obviously felt that this is the end of them, but we were showered. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And we came out of it, which is so unbelievable that -- that that impression, that horrendous thing, it stays like a picture in your mind forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And then we were taken back. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And the other, of course, the counting that I already told you about, that they marched us out from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> constantly to stand in <span class="DLF">lines</span> and count us, stand in rows. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And the other horrendous impression was when they came with their leather boots and the German Shepherds with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And bringing the food, which always looked to me like some kind of a dishwater with something floating in it that looked like some burgundy sausage or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Something disgusting looking in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">That was the food, and a little bit of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I don't know, I really honestly I don't know how we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I really do not know how we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">How we survived the hunger, how we survived the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It's like it's hard, it's amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I remember also being marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> about eight months after being there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  I think before we get to that next thing, could I ask you a couple of questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  Do you remember, you know, the guards or the people in charge of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Just impressions of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Just the uniformed Nazis with the German Shepherds barking just like their dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Their mean faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They were very scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  They were mean to you as a child?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  Do you remember if there were any -- for fun, were there any...
ANSWER:  None whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">None whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  I mean, as kid, I'm trying to figure out what you did all day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Just we were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">In the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We were crying, telling stories, trying to -- I don't even know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  Do you know if there was any awareness of the Sabbath or of any holidays during this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  I don't believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I don't believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Maybe quietly my mother sang something to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I don't even know what day was following what day. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There was such a loss of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I don't know whether they knew really what day it was of the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  Anything else you can remember about what your life was like there? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Are there impressions, things that made you afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  Just the silence, the guards, the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> of the guards, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">The <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> all around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Everything is muddy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It's -- that whole environment of a depressed environment, a depression on everybody's faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Everybody looked very skinny, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Everyone lost their healthy weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Everyone waiting around to die, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I don't think at that point anyone thought that we'll survive or that we will come out of it alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  That was the feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Iam sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I am sure that no one believed that we will ever come out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So you were starting to say that about eight months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Eight months later, we were marched out of the camp all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I guess the deal was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And the payment, the final payment to the Germans was paid, I think, as we entered the <span class="DLF">Swiss borders</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And we were marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and I remember that we were marched out by fours, which means they were marching in groups of fours. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And somebody in front, maybe there was a row that there were like three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So this Nazi bastard with his dog was standing there, and pulled somebody forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And from every <span class="DLF">line</span> , he pulled somebody forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So you were feeling that missing person. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">That happened in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I was on the edge, and I remember pulling my arm from my mother's arm and pushing me forward, one <span class="DLF">line</span> forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I was horrified; I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I was not next to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And with the force that he flung me forward, I started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And it took a while for us to walk away a little bit before my mother asked the person next to her to switch <span class="NPIP">places</span> with me so that she can have me next to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I remember that horrified moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">You know, you lose all the confidence -- the little confidence that you still have within you, you lose it because you are just thrown in front of your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">But it was done in such a brutal way that it totally shook me up as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Did they tell you why you were being marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or where you were going to, do you...
ANSWER:  Not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I don't know what they told my mother or where they are taking us. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I don't know that she knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I don't know that they talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We were just all marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We were taken out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Did the boys join you? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Did you see your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The men, the boys who were there, they joined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I didn't see my -- I don't remember seeing my brother until we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but it's possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  And this was all the same group who...
ANSWER:  The same group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">The 1.800 people that came with us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">That same original group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They must have struck a deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  And some of them you hadn't seen for a while in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or you had all been together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  We were in different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Some of us were in the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Some of us were in different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And don't forget I didn't know that many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">My mother knew many more. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I was just a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">so I -- my world was my mother and my aunt and my cousin who were with me, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I can't remember -- I don't remember anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">My only memory of everybody else is after we have come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and those that my mother remained friendly with.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  How are you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  I'm doing fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Tape 2
QUESTION:  Let's pick up. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">You were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="541">You were temporarily separated from your mother, and then I guess she joined you in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Then what do you remember happening after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  I remember being put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , a normal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And riding and arriving in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And I remember -- really, the fact that we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> , that didn't not affect -- I don't recall that at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  You can't recall the ride?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  I don't recall the ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">What I do remember 1s arriving to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that looked like a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">In my child's eye, I thought that we had arrived to the biggest <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> , almost like in a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I remember coming there, and the children were given toys by the Red Cross and being fed and being taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="DLF">Hotel Esplanade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And very shortly after arriving and probably being checked physically and medically and checking for lice and checking to see if everybody who needs medical attention and so forth, very shortly afterwards, they took all the children away. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And we were brought to a -- up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> , you know, like into like a farm area for recuperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And just to get us a little bit healthier after all the ordeal of being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">At this point the Red Cross was there to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">The Schlakim (ph) , which are messengers from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time came to our aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">They were working very hard on receiving the proper certificates to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , because we could not enter freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And some semblance of normal life wanted to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Now, that's what they wanted to achieve. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So they took us into a -- as I said, it was probably like a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Almost like a kibbutz kind of a thing on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And they started process, they started to try to teach us according to the level that we were at, what we were supposed to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And I don't even remember -- probably they tried to teach us in Hungarian, if I'm not wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> we all learned a little bit of German because that was the spoken language in that area of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And each and one of us kind of picked up some German language. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I remember sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , it was very frightening to me to some extent because here I was away from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">My mother was left in this big <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> with a lot of other women who were widowed, and all the children in all ages were gathered together. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And teachers were brought from all over to try to teach us, and they tried to conduct classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And I just remember me sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and totally gazing and not comprehending anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It was like in a <span class="NPIP">dream</span> , I remember sitting there saying to myself that "This is <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ," but my mind was totally on other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I could not concentrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I don't remember that -- I can't recall if I learned anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I probably remember just learning just a little bit of the ABCs, the lettering, the beginning of learning how to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">But to tell you that this was a formal schooling that I could recall or I can retain anything, probably very little because of the emotional upheaval that probably I felt as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">The one thing for sure that none of us got was psychological counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That was not in anybody's agenda or even in their -- in anybody's thought that that was needed at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I remember the older children putting up a play of David and Goliath. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I remember my brother playing the role of Goliath if I'm -- of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And -- but I don't remember anything else from <span class="REGION">area</span> , just the fact that there was a lot of cheese, which I hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">There was a lot of milk, which I didn't like to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Most people were so happy so see cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">As a child, these were things that I did not like to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I did not like cheese, and I didn't like hard-boiled eggs, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I used to choke on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There are memories of things that I really could not -- I guess I could not tolerate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And other than that, really the time in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> passed by, and before we knew it -- I also remember something that really stayed with me, is the fact that the Swiss people did not look upon us kindly. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They were not friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">They really did not like foreigners, and they -- I'm sure that this was very hard for them to get this many refugees in one of their <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And from there we were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I don't know what mode of transportation, in all honesty. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Probably by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> we were taken by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I want to just stop you for a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  To see if you can recall anything else about <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I appreciate that your mind was not on your classes...
ANSWER:  Um-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  ... at this <span class="BUILDING">farm school</span> or whatever, but do you have any remembrance of what kind of classes? </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Did they give you any religious classes, any kind of classes that might help you prepare for living in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I don't really recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I recall other things that were very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You know, in every <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , there are children who are the bullies? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">In every <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> that there is the girl who is the queen and it's amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I remember being afraid of some of the kids because they were so demanding and being afraid emotionally from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I was a very sensitive child. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Interestingly enough, I grew in to be quite a strong adult, and even as a youngster life kind of prepared me to become quite a strong individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But I remember the sensitivity of being easily hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I had a lot of wotries for a six-year-old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I had to worry that I'm alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I had to worry that somebody will demand things of me that I won't be able to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I had to worry about my safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I had to worry about my existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I had to worry where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Where is going to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I had to worry if my father will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">A lot of those things are constantly on my mind, and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was the farthest thing from my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I was really more concerned of how to survive in this kind of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I'm sure they prepared us. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">As I said, they had put up a play of David and Goliath, so obviously the themes of tradition and the themes of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the themes of the Bible were brought back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And don't forget a lot of these children have studied already in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and a lot of them went to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Gymnasiums</span> or went to other <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They had backgrounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">My brother knew how to speak Hebrew already. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Not fluently, but he studied Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So he knew how to read and he knew how to write and he knew how to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I didn't know one word at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I didn't have that in my background yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  When you say that you had so much on your mind as a small child, were there things that you remember doing to protect yourself or to just get by?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  I remember having to worry about what will I give to this girl that I will live in peace? </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I don't even remember who she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But, you know, that concern, what could I give her or what could I make for her or whatever from the little that I knew how to make or give or whatever -- what did I have? </span><span class="sentence" id="632">But I had a lot of worries like that for my little survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I was very little physically, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Not just age-wise, I was very little physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  But you had other strengths?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Because he was busy with his age group. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">He was busy with his own survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">He had his friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It was different, and I don't know, he loved me very much, but I don't think that he understood or that I understood what I needed or what he needed.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  But you did go to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  I think we went to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">It wasn't such a big distance, but it's a very big distance 1f you don't have with what to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But I think every once in a while, we were taken back to visit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  Eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">It took a long time for them to be able to obtain the proper certificates to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  Was there any consciousness of the war ending in Europe while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">ANSWER:  I am sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  But not for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  Not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I just remember one thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> that was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">You know, when I said to you that a child always gauges their mood according to her mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And I remember in a crowd standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , it was like on the top of the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">My mother was standing, and I was standing next to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">They were listening to news on the radio out loud, and everybody started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And my mother was crying, and, of course, I immediately started crying because as soon as she cried, I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="692">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="693">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And my mother telling me that President Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I didn't know who President Roosevelt was. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But the news that he died created such a sorrow in everybody, if they would have only known how little he has done, if anything at all, to save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">But everybody was so sure then that he was doing his utmost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you can recall about those eight months in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Or who took care of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I don't even remember who took of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I'm sure there was some older individuals who took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don't even remember so much the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">It was definitely 1,000 percent improvement over Bergen-Belsen, and it took me many, many years to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And I visited with my husband <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreuil</span> , I said to him, "I think the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> is supposed to be in this <span class="REGION">area</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And I said, "I wonder if this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> still exists, and if it exists, is it big or is it small?" </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Because, you know, when you look as a child, some <span class="NPIP">thing</span> looks humongous and you don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Well, I called my brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and asked him, and he said, "Yes, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koln</span> (ph) above <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreuil</span> is <span class="DLF">Hotel Esplanade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It still exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">You go out there." </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Well, we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which is like a Venicula (ph), it's almost like a mountain-climbing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And I cannot tell you- I just sat there and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I can't explain the emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I didn't way one word, but as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> climbed higher and higher, the tears just rolled down my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And when I got to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , when we finally got there, indeed, the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was a huge <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">A very elaborate <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , it's not a wonder that in my eyes it looked like a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Because, as it turns out, the lady who greeted us at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , she said, "This <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was once upon a time the <span class="DLF">winter playground</span> for all the royalties of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">They used to come here for ice skating and for skiing and for all sports activities, winter sport activities." </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And this was really like a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And she showed us a movie about the history of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">She says, "You are not the only refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">There are many of them who have come back to visit through the years." </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It ceased to exist as a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> nowadays. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">During the war they wanted to tear it down because nobody came to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And then they kept it as a <span class="BUILDING">refugee center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">The refugees that were brought out of the war passed through this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Now, they showed us this movie, and they showed also movies about all these royalties used to come and ice skate and ski over in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And after the war, after the refugees have left, again they wanted to tear down the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and they decided to keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And now they use it for an organization, a worldwide organization, for sane armament. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">These are people who are obviously pacifists who come there for conferences during the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And they live very much like on a kibbutz, because they cook and they share in the cooking, washing the dishes, serving, taking care of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Everybody really shares in the upkeep. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And I don't know for how long, for a month or two months during the summertime, they keep it for conferences like that for sane armament. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">But, indeed, the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was a very elaborate, large, large <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So it wasn't just in my child's memory, but as an adult, 1t was quite interesting to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Now, you were somehow taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  Do you know how long you were there before you got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION:  Do you -- was there a large group with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  The entire group, the original group, were all taken Bari. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Put on this Viadole (ph), I think was the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Viadoran (ph), if 1â€™m not mistaken was the name of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and we were taken with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">It was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I don't even remember how many days it took us to sail from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But when arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , I remember getting off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and we were given some nuts and I think an orange. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">My two hands filled up -- one orange filled up two hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And I remember that my brother, my father's youngest brother, he was only living relative who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">He left to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> when he was very young, and he was there from the age of 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So he had went in the '30s to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And he was like the welcoming committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">But we were taken from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aclite</span> (ph) , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British concentration camp</span> kind of thing, in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aclite</span> (ph) you were disinfected and checked for health, for this, for other reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And we were the first alia (ph) after the war to arrive to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that had permits to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I think every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> after us were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  What month is this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  This was in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So we were -- September 3rd, 1945, to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  The mood on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> must have been pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  Iam sure the mood was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">The conditions on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> were not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And I don't know how good the mood could have been on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , because they were going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They were going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was not free. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it was under British mandate. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">They knew darn well that the relationship between the Arabs and Jews was not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They were hoping. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And don't forget there were a lot of women without their husbands with two children, three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Generally two or one, who came together with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">The clothes on their back, no money, no husband, no prospects, no jobs, no profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  Do you remember your impressions when you got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  My only impression was it was sunny. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">It was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> full of light, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And seeing an orange made a very big impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And in a very short time after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aclite</span> (ph) , we were dispersed. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I was sent with three other children, give or take one girl, a brother and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">She's a year younger than me; he is two years older than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And another young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We were sent to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">My brother was sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">My cousin was sent to a third <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And her brother was sent to the fourth <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So we were not together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">QUESTION:  And your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  And my mother stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for women. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So this time we were separated for good for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halba</span> , which is close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">My mother stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">My brother was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neva-Tan</span> (ph), and my two other cousins to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French kibbutzim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And that was -- that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And at this time I found myself in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , all by myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">QUESTION:  Were you scared?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">How comfortable could I have been? </span><span class="sentence" id="794">At this point I was already seven and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Think of it, I was seven and a half years old, so I missed first grade; I missed second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And I just started first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">That was the first time that I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and starting to learn how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">On top of it I arrived to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> that nobody spoke Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I spoke very little German, and I definitely did not speak Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So the communication was very difficult, but like all children, you quickly learn -- you quickly learn a new language when you are forced to learn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But again, the communication with my mother and father was very difficult, because I didn't know how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I just started to learn how to read and write in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">My language skills could not have been great at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And like all first graders, you can imagine how well I wrote and how many spelling mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">My mother did not know how to read Hebrew, and I didn't -- I couldn't read her Hungarian letters to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And nobody could read them to me either. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">My brother wrote to me in Hebrew, which I couldn't read either. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">But that could -- at least somebody could read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">So it's a little bit comical, but it was a quite difficult communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And I didn't see my mother very often because the circumstances in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> were so difficult at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">These were the times of the uprising, this was pre-War of Independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Traveling was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">People traveled with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored vehicles</span> , and they traveled only in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You didn't see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> riding freely on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , you were only safe if you traveled in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravans</span> and in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored vehicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So really I think I saw my mother twice a year during this while period, and I was there for three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  What was your life like then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  The kibbutz life was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I mean I'm sure it wasn't easy for me emotionally, but it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">There was a lot of -- I think I can attribute there was a lot of caring. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I think we got something, somebody cared about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I think we got that sense -- that sense did come through. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I think going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day, and from very early young age they teach you to work a little bit to keep you busy, and to keep you a productive individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">It kept us very busy and very active and not allowing too much, you know, for day dreaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And every child was assigned to a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Unfortunately for me, I was assigned to the shoemaker in the kibbutz, who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who was a widower, and who had a daughter a year older than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So I was not assigned to a family where there was a mother and a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I was assigned to a family that there was only a father, and since he had a daughter who was a year older than me, he just didn't know how to be a parent for both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He was a good man, but, you know, if you have a choice between your own daughter and somebody's else's daughter, it's a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So, but that was the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">But, generally speaking, I think there was lot of positive things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">A lot of, you know, a lot of things that were taught that were very positive and very nice, and the holidays were always celebrated in a very nice manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">This was not a religious kibbutz at all, but all the Biblical holidays were celebrated on -- in a freer way. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">That you felt -- I felt very much that I belonged, so there was a lot of caring. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I know I missed my mother, I know I fantasized a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I fantasized a lot about my brother, and that is strange, that's even more. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Because here he was already he went into the Navy, and I always worried whether he is going to get killed or is he going to be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And so my brother, again, loomed larger than life in my eyes in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I seldom saw him, very seldom. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So really with the exception of living together in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , we never again lived together in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">QUESTION:  Were there a lot of other children on this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> who were essentially in your predicament? </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Who had come here, who had been separated from their ...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">In fact, that's what I said to people, you know, at times when they asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I was one of the fortunate ones, I had a brother; I had a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">My friends, the two brother and sister, they had a mother and they had each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Then the children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tehran</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">These were children from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , primarily Polish children, who came without a soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">They lost their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">They lost their siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They lost their uncles, their grandparents, everything in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">They were sole survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So at that time, as much as one wanted to feel sorry for oneself, I think there was always somebody who was in a worse position than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And these children came with no one, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> absorbed them into families. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">They became their families, literally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  Were you conscious of that at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="857">What were you thinking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  I was very conscious of it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I was always very -- very, very sensitive to other people's feelings and other children's feelings as much as I was sensitive to my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I was very sensitive, very caring, and I think I also rationalized it was a very good way of protecting myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I rationalized, so -- there are people that have less than you, so it's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It wasn't the end of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I think that's what kept my sanity, that I was able always to see maybe the better side of things instead of the worst <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I just feel I was very fortunate as a child, because, in all honesty, when I think back that none of us ever, ever got any psychological counseling or help or group session or -- it wasn't even talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Everybody just went about their lives going on, it really didn't come back to haunt me until I had children of my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I didn't realize the feelings that I stored <span class="NPIP">inside</span> until I had my own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Because, you see, as I saw them growing up and I realized the ages, the circumstances, that's when I had a difficult time to reconcile with what I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Because you see your children, how vulnerable they are at such a young age and how needy they are, it's very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">On the other hand, it made me very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">It made me able to slough off a lot of things and be able to face life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  Did you develop close relationships in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  I'm sure I had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">How close relationships, nothing that was overwhelmingly comfortable, you know, in hindsight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  Did you have fun?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  I had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I had a pretty good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I had a good time, but I think I had -- I was also a very serious child. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I probably carried a lot of worry on my little shoulders, I'm sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I remember I always had a recurring nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It turned out that a siren was going on and everybody was rushing for the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , and I couldn't run and I couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">My legs wouldn't carry me. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And I was crawling on all four in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , and everybody was passing me by. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And I just -- my legs were paralyzed, I could not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So I know where it comes from. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But for many years I had this recurring nightmare, same thing all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  What do you think you were...
ANSWER:  It was my fears of survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">QUESTION:  Do you think that you generally felt safe finally in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER:  I felt safe, but I know that I also probably put up a good facade. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I remember when <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was declared a free state, we were sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I must have been -- 1948, I was 11 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And we were awakened, we were sleeping, we were awakened all to come out and dance, and everybody was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And they announced at the same time that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> was conquered, and I became hysterical. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Because I did not understand that it was conquered by the Israelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I was positive that my mother is finished with, because that's where she lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I was positive that if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> was conquered, my mother must be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So that happy occasion where everybody came out and they were dancing, and they brought out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freezers</span> the little apples that they were saving for a special occasion, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And everybody was really in such a joyous mood. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">It took me time from being awakened in the middle of the night to understand the consequences and the ramifications of this news. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So that wasn't easy either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  Why don't you just kind of tell me briefly what happened after? </span><span class="sentence" id="901">You were on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> for three and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="902"><span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> became <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">QUESTION:  And you were at that point rejoined with your family or with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">ANSWER:  My mother remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I never met the man that she remarried at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">My mother just announced to me in a letter that she has remarried, she has gotten remarried and that they would like me to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And it was good news and bad news for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">It was good news because finally I'm going to be with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">It was bad news to me because in my little mind I probably conjured up this image that if my mother is going to remarry, I have decided in advance that I'm going to hate this individual, and I will not -- he cannot replace my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">At that point my mother knew very well that my father is no longer alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And she consulted with my brother, who was in the Navy, who was also closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">The Navy was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , so they saw each other quite frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And she introduced the man that she was going to marry to my brother, and my brother was all for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But nobody consulted me, and nobody introduced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I was far away, I was not near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And so I was brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , swearing to myself that I'm going to really hate this man and I'm not going to obey him. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">This was what went on in mind at that time, but really in no time at all I realized what a nice individual she married. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And he was a survivor also, who lost his wife and two children in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And his oldest daughter was my age, and she had my middle name, Suzannah (ph) . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And so he was quite a nice father to me; I think he loved me dearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And that had a very good effect on my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">He was a good family man. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He was extremely, extremely sensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">But at the time that I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , I felt estranged from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I mean she was important to me, but I no longer felt that need to be that close. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Or I think I had also a lot of anger in me probably that was never verbalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But by the time I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then things were done in very haphazard way. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , I was at that time in the fourth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And they decided since I was older -- and I was probably a fairly decent student. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I wasn't a super student, but I was good, average student. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">They decided that oh, it's ttme to make up a grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So I went for half a year in the fourth grade, and in the middle of the year, I transferred to the fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I think they would have done much better if they would skipped fourth grade altogether and put me in the fifth grade right in from the start, so I will have an equal opportunity to start at the same level. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">But by the time I started fifth grade in the middle of the year, I was totally lost again. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And this time they lost me from math forever, I was not a big mathematician. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And I think from multiplying and dividing, I got into fractions. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I never learned the basics of how to deal with fractions in the beginning of the year, and I think it was extremely difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Extremely difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I got into a very good grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I got into a good grade in terms socially, it was very compatible and terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">But academically, especially in math, I had a lot of difficulty that dragged on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I always needed a private tutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Somehow I could never catch up to what I lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">QUESTION:  So you finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> with your newly constituted family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">In the years that I was growing up, <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> was through eighth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">There was only <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">There was no <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So you went for eight years to <span class="BUILDING">elementary</span> and four years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And when I finished <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , the eighth grade, it was by my mother's recommendation that I should maybe look into a <span class="BUILDING">technical high school</span> , where I could learn a profession and I can finish my high school diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">At first I didn't want to hear about it, but then I decided that that's a very good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And I went and I looked at a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I liked it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">It was very creative, and I was a very creative child. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I guess I had a lot of creativity in me that I didn't even know that existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and that's where I really blossomed, because we learned a lot of things that were of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">You know, we learned how to sew and how to embroider and how to knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And a lot of the creative handwork and crafts -- excuse me -- and I succeeded quite nicely in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and that helped me a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">By the time I finished my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> diploma there, I had a profession also. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And I went back for an extra year for a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span> , so that I became an arts and crafts teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And soon thereafter, I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">As soon as I finished really my <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Finished it in late June, and in August I got married of that year.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  You know, I'm sure there was a point at which...
ANSWER:  I think through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I felt fairly confident. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Solid ground, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I don't think -- I'm on as solid ground as anybody could ever hope for now in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But I will never feel on solid ground in this lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I feel -- I don't dwell on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I really don't dwell on it, because I like to dwell on the positive versus the negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Even as a child, Passover time, they used to all bring up everything that happened in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">You know, they talk about the exit from <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and, you know, our forefathers coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And they started in about what happened, how they rounded us up, how this one walked through <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">The other one went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">You know, everybody brought up their story, and it used to drive me crazy as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">At that point, I said, "We are already in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We are already in freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Why do we have to talk about it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I realized why we had to talk about it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And many times I blamed myself because of that, that I didn't ask all the questions while my parents -- while they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I didn't want to deal with it, so I did not ask all the questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And really I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> the other day, and I sat with my brother and my cousin who was with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , we were discussing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And everybody has just almost awakened to ask the questions, and nobody has parents anymore to ask them from. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">While they were alive, none of us wanted to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="992">So, yes, you say you're confident, and maybe you pretend to be confident, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">But I -- as I said, I dwell on the positive, and I think about, you know, in a positive way. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">But to say I'm on solid ground, I'm not afraid that tomorrow somebody's going to tell me to pack up and move. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But I will never say that it cannot happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">There are times when we joke or we sit around and talk, and, say, in case of emergency -- I use it, in case of emergency, something disastrous would have happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Let's see, what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="998">What are the skills that we have? </span><span class="sentence" id="999">What is it that we can do to survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">It's always in the back of my mind somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">God forbid that I should have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I'm not looking forward to this.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">ANSWER:  Maybe my mother wasn't -- you know, it took me a long time to grow up, to realize, to understand the circumstances of her life were not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">She was not the most communicative person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And there were instances, I think, especially one that I recall that I was greatly disappointed by her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">She was supposed to come and visit me on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and there was only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> a day that came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And I was waiting and waiting for her, and she never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And don't forget, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I mean there no telephones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">There were no -- the grocer and some other -- the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> had a telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Nobody had phones at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So you couldn't pick up the phone and say, "Dear, I am sorry I couldn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">This and this happened." </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">So I had to wait for the mail to arrive as to why she didn't show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Well, she didn't show up because she traveled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , and she had a few hours to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And she visited a friend, and she missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And I couldn't get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I couldn't get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">I'm not sure that I have gotten over it, because obviously I still mention it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And my mother, may she rest in peace, she's dead since '79. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">That kind of a thing, it remained with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">That maybe I felt 1t was more important for her to visit her friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I know it was not, and I'm sure that she was sorely disappointed that missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I can imagine her feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">But in those days, you just did not communicate and say, "You have no idea how sorry I am or how upset I was, that I didn't -- and I'll make it up to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">The facts were stated, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">My mother didn't -- she was a sensitive person, but she didn't know how to communicate in a sensitive way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And so things like that and some other little episodes that caused, we had a good relationship with each other, but it wasn't a close, close warm relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I hear sometimes people talk about their mothers, how much they miss them and how much -- how close they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">How devastated they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Everything, you know, because their mother passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I was very hurt when she passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I loved her dearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I wasn't devastated, I hurt for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I hurt for the life that she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">I understand her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And in a way, I have forgiven for this or that little thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Our lives, the circumstances were horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I would not have wanted to be the mother in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">It was much easier to be a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Much, much easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">QUESTION:  Let's stop the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Tape 3
QUESTION:  You know, I think it seems that when your mother didn't show up on your kibbutz, it must have been very, very frightening because you had already lost one parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">You had been separated from your mother from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">ANSWER:  What that meant in those days, it's not the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">It's not something that you can even comprehend in terms of your daily life today, because it wasn't the missing of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or the -- the pain that went with it was so overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">The disappointment was so great, because you were a child alone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and I probably have not seen my mother for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And she just did not show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And it wasn't that she could come back with the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that will come the following day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Because she had only that weekend, she had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> because she was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">She was alone, she needed to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">So the comprehension of nowadays where you could pick up a phone and you can call, and so what if she missed not coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">So she will come next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">That was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">When she missed that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , there was this child that was still standing there waiting for her and conjuring up the imagination of being hugged and kissed and loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">She just didn't show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And in the end, it took another six months, it wasn't so simple for me as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I didn't have somebody to tuck me in and hug me every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">So the disappointment was horrendous, and it obviously had to be horrendous if I still speak about it at 58 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I should have gotten over it long ago, but this explains a little bit that I'm trying to think why was that little bit of estrangement between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">It wasn't an estrangement, we were friends in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">But in some ways, that warmth that we had for each other on my part changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Something changed in formula. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I guess she was needy in one way; I was needy in another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">It's hard to explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">QUESTION:  Maybe you could summarize for me what happened after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">You got married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1101">ANSWER:  I got married in 1957. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">August '57. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">To a young Israeli-born individual whose parents also came from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , but they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before the war, in the '30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And so there was a sabra, and my husband right from the beginning spoke about the fact that he is -- he wants to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Because he felt that there was a future, there is something that he -- he felt the need to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">That he needs to go, he needs to explore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">He needs to find himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And, of course, I never took him seriously, because neither one of us came from <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that could afford this luxury of going anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And I really didn't think we'll ever come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but so I let him talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">But little did I know that at that time, I didn't know my husband well enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Now, I would believe him, but in those days, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And he really made arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">He had an uncle in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he made arrangements through a friend who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to arrange for the papers and for his uncle to loan him the money to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And once we'll get here, we'll work and we'll give him back the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And within six months, we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">So little did I know what I hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and we worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">sweat shop</span> sewing doll clothes, and my husband who finished the <span class="BUILDING">technical high school</span> just like me, went to work as a tool and die maker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And we were looking for a way of solving the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Our friends talked us into teaching <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I had a teacher's certificate anyway as a teacher, and my husband decided to try it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And we got a job as <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> teachers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectady</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">During the summertime, not to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for such a long time, we went to -- we got a job ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">It's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ramah</span> (ph), which is a Hebrew-speaking camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And really that was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We spent the summer there, we learned a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And during the winter, we taught <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And at that point, we have decided that there has to be a purpose why we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">We could not just leave <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , leave our friends, leave our parents, leave the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and spend some time teaching <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">That wasn't enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So Simon started seriously studying for his SATs, and trying to learn by himself how to do -- how to take the tests and how to score. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And a year later, we felt that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectady</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is too isolated a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">This is just not -- wasn't the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> for two young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">We were very, very lonely and alone there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And after spending another summer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> , we got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quincy</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , which is south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , 15 miles south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And we went to teach there in a very lovely congregation, and Simon applied to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BU</span> and was accepted as an engineering student. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And so our life was set. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">We both worked full-time as <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> teachers, and Simon went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And he graduated within four years, aeronautical engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">Then once that was done, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">At this stage of our lives in 1964, we were married about seven years or so, and we really -- already beforehand we really wanted to have children, start a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I couldn't have any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And so as a result, we started to look into adoption which was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> they had the blue laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Only Jewish children can a Jewish couple adopt, and you could not adopt a child out of your faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , we applied again for adoption. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">The situation was very similar in those days and very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So Simon worked for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Grumman Aircraft</span> for two years, and I went back -- I left the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> teaching, which was a good job and wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">But I really desired a more creative job, and I wanted to design dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Just really what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I learned, and I was a dress designer for a <span class="BUILDING">children's manufacturer</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">When we realized that we will never be able to adopt a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , two years later Simon looked for a job in <span class="REGION">California</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Everybody told us that it's much easier to adopt children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , and that's the place for us to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And so we took off, literally took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Simon got a job through the Wall Street Journal with <span class="BUILDING">Litten Industries</span> , and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , total strangers again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">The wandering Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , we did not know a soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I think we were in <span class="BUILDING">motel</span> when we applied for adoption through the Los Angeles County of Adoption Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And we started working: Simon at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litten</span> ; me as a dress designer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Worked very hard, the two of us, to make end meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And nine months later we got our son, our first child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And we named him Terrence, a nice Irish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And we gave him a Hebrew name, Alonim (ph) , which is an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oak tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Nice and strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And actually we call him Terry or Alonim, depending on what the mood is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And today he's 28 years old, he's married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">He lives up in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And he has no children, and I don't think he desires to have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Later on, we adopted a little girl, and we named her Corey Tamar, but actually she's called Tammy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">So she's not using any of formal names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Everybody calls her Tammy, and she's 24 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And she's engaged to be married, and she's finishing her Master's Degree in social work at <span class="BUILDING">Boston University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And a year from now in October, she'll get married to a wonderful young man who is at <span class="BUILDING">Yale Law School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And the two children really -- the two children with us formed our little family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And we raised them in <span class="REGION">California</span> partially, and then Simon got a very good job over here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Terry was four and a half years old, and Tammy was seven months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So I arrived with two little kids in a brand new <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Again, not knowing almost anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But before long, you know, we made friends, and we realized really that it doesn't matter where you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">It's the friends that you make in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Every strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> is strange at first until you make some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And now we have so many friends, we don't have time for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And we live out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">QUESTION:  I guess you learned to be very adaptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1186">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">QUESTION:  Because you had been uprooted. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">ANSWER:  So many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I have moved so many times that it's really hard to count already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Even within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you know, you live in one <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> ; then you move to another and you move to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And you go to summer and you come back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">QUESTION:  What were your biggest surprises when you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Was it what you expected?</span></p>
