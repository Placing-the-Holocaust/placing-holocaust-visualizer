<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  When were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born on June 17, 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little about who was in your family, the composition of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  The family was composed of my father, mother, four brothers, and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Luckily, three of my brothers left for <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was left at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my parents and a brother, and the four of us were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Father’s name: Jorge (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Franco Mother’s name: Rosa Galante Oldest brother: Maurice Franco Second brother: Salvatore Franco Third brother: Nissim Franco Youngest brother: David, the one deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  And where did you grow up? </span><span class="sentence" id="9">You were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodos</span> , where did you grow up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Although I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , I grew up on another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , a small one: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My family kept Jewish traditions and holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father was head of the <span class="BUILDING">Kos synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  How large was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  The community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> had about 30 families. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The (Sephardic) Jewish community was larger in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , where I had aunts, uncles, cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">There were multiple contacts between the two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> — visits and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I can say I grew up on both <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We took many trips between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , I studied until age 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Then, until age 17, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , but had to stop in 1938 because of the racial laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  I will be asking more questions about that, for sure, in just a few moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">What was the work that your father and/or mother did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  My mother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My father was a businessman — Import/export. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Shell (7) representative. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He was doing import/export commerce between the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> , especially between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and the other smaller <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> that belonged to the Duc de Canais (ph.; </span><span class="sentence" id="27">nothing similar found on Internet). </span><span class="sentence" id="28">In order to transport the merchandise, he had his own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and he was also going to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> to get some merchandise, since Kos 1s very close to the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  What was the language or the languages that you spoke at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and also in the community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we spoke Sephardic Spanish, which has been spoken since 1492. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We also spoke Italian-Greek, and so did the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It was a harmonious life among people who had three different religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> like where you were growing up, where you were living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Some of the Greek people that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> came originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They were expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> at the time of the reforms of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atartuk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There were Turkish people, and there were Greek people that had been there for many, many years and generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">In <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , at the end of the time of the Sultan, when he chased them from <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , they sent away all the Greek people as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So some of them came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and so we— although we were Greek, we had a lot of Turkish traditions in our daily life — in our cooking, and even some of the words, to the point that my mother knew some of the Turkish words but she thought they had always been Greek words — all Greek words. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But one year, she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and discovered they were Turkish words.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  So were you actually socializing in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with other non-Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  On the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was run by nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They were Italian nuns that ran the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and all the children went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , but at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they was no difference between Jewish, (Greek) Orthodox, or any other religion, and we all grew up together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  No anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The Jewish community was respected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Would you tell me a little bit more about your relationships with your siblings, with your brothers, I believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  We had excellent relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The two oldest brothers went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodesia</span> in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The other brother, Nissim, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time of the racial laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He volunteered in the Palestinian Brigade (British Army), and fought in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and then in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Did you hear of Hitler pretty early on, any time 1933 or after?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  No, we did not hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We were pretty ignorant. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We never felt anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">When the Italians came, they sent two groups of officers — Italian military — at some point in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But we never felt anything because the Italians always behaved very well toward us. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I said before that we were not supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when the racial laws started, but the Italians were very apologetic to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They told us that those were the rules that they had received and unfortunately they had to apply them at some point in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Not at the beginning, but at some point they were obliged to. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And also some of the Jews belonged to clubs — you know, an Italian circle of clubs, and we were excluded from them at that time also. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But the Italians were again apologetic about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They said they were obliged to do it because of some rules they had received from the mainland. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Generally, we had normal life even after racial laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  What year did the racial laws go into effect in your <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  At the beginning the racial laws were— besides not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the club — being excluded from the club— the attitude between the Italian officers and the Jewish population was the same, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and the group was very small, so everybody knew everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And the Italian behavior stayed the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It’s only after the attempt on Hitler’s life, that things got tougher because of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">That was on July 20, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  I think I forgot my question. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I think I understand that it wasn’t a drastic change of lifestyle when the racial laws were implemented. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">However, I’m wondering if you and your family, or others in the Jewish community were talking about this and very concerned about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  We had news, in some of the Italian newspapers, but since it was so far away, we thought, you know, we were not concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We were very isolated in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and even the attitude of the Italian officers was very relaxed, so we wouldn’t think that something was really happening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That’s why we were not as concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The situation worsened when Badoglio, who was marshal in the Italian army, and the king, Vittorio Emmanuel the Third, when they asked for the armistice with the Allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And at that time, things got a little tougher. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italians were asking for the armistice and they got it, they felt they were betrayed by the Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">At that point in time, they sent some troops to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It was only nine months before our eventual deportation that at some point in time the Germans, after seeing what the Italians did, sent more troops to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But the local population was not aware of anything, and even the Germans that were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> were acting very normal and polite with all the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We did not know, but in the meantime, they had taken all the information on Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They took all the addresses and knew who was living where and they already had all the information on Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They were not showing anything, but they had already started. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">German troops came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> on September 8, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">At some point, after the armistice, the Germans had their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And at that point, they called all the Italian officers and told them, “Your king and the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice, so what are you going to do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And at that point, the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But the officers stayed on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They were not supposed to leave the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , but they were not put as a military officer in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , they were just free to stay on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Therefore, the Jews were registered, but we knew nothing about what was going on in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">At the moment of the armistice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, they tried to land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But the Germans had sent some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> to bomb them. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And then the British tried to land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , but they couldn’t succeed, so they had to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And so we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And the Jewish population and the rest of the population stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">The Italians didn’t say anything and maybe didn’t know anything about the plans of the Germans, but at some point, the Germans that were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> of course, told the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> that if they wanted to leave, they could leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">This was because we were going to run out of food because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> was kind of isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It was surrounded by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British submarines</span> , and we had difficulty finding food. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So they had asked the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> if any of us wanted to leave the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Did you or your family express interest in leaving? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Did you know people personally — people in the Jewish community — who were leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  My father said leaving was not necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He thought the war would end soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Maybe a couple of people left the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  At this point, before you were deported of course, is there any stage where you were really starting to feel fear? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">You or your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  We had no fear because we had, at some point... The British had bombed a few times, but we were not afraid because we were thinking that the war was about to end. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So we said it’s not the time to be afraid, and we are far away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Did you hear about the war in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> — in Europe for instance? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Did you even... When did you know that the war had started — in September of 1939? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">When did you learn about those events?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  We were not aware, because in a certain way, we knew about the war, but we were not very concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And then, unfortunately, I feel bad about the ignorance, but we had no more radios, but more than that— that was not an excuse, but more than that it’s because we saw the Italians around us who were not concerned, so we didn’t know why we would be concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask a little bit more about the racial laws and to get a little more detail on what you recall you had to do differently because of the laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  The Italians never made us feel that there was a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We thought that we had to stop going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because of the war and that’s how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We thought we’d be able to go back after the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Tape 1, Side B
QUESTION:  We were last talking about the racial laws and I want to make sure we have the chronology of events correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So I want to establish exactly when it was when you no longer could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  We could no longer go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I had done quite a bit of <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> , so it was not hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But small children had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  What exactly did you do every day after you no longer were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I was still going to take piano lessons because I had started at the <span class="BUILDING">nun’s school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I started when I was three years old and kept on taking piano lessons with the sister who was giving piano lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The sister wanted me also to help out with other small children and give them some lessons in piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">These were not Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  And then we were also talking about the possibility for people to leave the island of Kos and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Could we establish exactly when you learned about this in relationship to the racial laws and other events?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  We were not— The Germans were not treating us the way they treated Jews in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We didn’t have to wear the star; we didn’t have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And the Germans would come to my father’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , buy merchandise, pay and be well-behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They were not aggressive to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">At one point, one of my father’s employees said, “Since we have this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that we use to do commerce in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> , why don’t we put all our merchandise and things out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The employee had asked also that my only brother that remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> -- not the ones who had left, but the only remaining brother, the youngest one — he would go with this boat captain to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and establish maybe a business on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , or start a life on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">This was winter 1943-44. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Kos to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> was only 4 km. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But my father said, “No, the war will end soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  At the time of this event of mentioning your brother and this German, was he actually a soldier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He was not a German; he was a Greek captain who was working for my father in February or March of 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  And how old were you about this time and how active are you in any of the decision making in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  I was 22-23 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I had no special role in the family’s decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My father decided.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Did the sisters talk to you about the problems? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Did they give you advice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  The nuns did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The sisters of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had no idea about what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was only at the moment of the deportation when the Germans arrested us, that one of the sisters in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the Mother Superior, came and said to the Germans that my mother was sick and was not very well and if she could stay because she had to get treatment and then they would send her afterward. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But she was thinking of sending my mother to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But my mother did not agree to stay behind... The sisters did not know what was going on in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Did they tell your father what to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="156">What role did your mother have in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Although she was Jewish, my mother worked with the Mother Superior sometimes, collecting money and doing charity work. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And she went around with the Mother Superior since my mother spoke Greek and also spoke Italian, Spanish and Turkish. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She was going around to collect funds for the children attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span> — they were basically Turkish and Greek poor children who didn’t have much and didn’t have shoes sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And so my mother was doing charity work for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  It sounded like there was a food shortage at some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Can you explain more about that and when that took place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  The food shortage was worse at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , and moreso in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was not so bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> (1942-43), since it was a small community and we knew (and were friends with) farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Did you hear much about what was happening on the mainland of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Specifically, I believe there were other deportations of Jews in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Did you hear anything about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  No, I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I only found out when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , where I met women from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> (Thessaloniki) — where 50,000 Jews were exterminated in 1943 — who told me what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  I want to go back just for a moment, because some of the reading I had done, I had seen something about actually this is not during the war but back to 1933, something about there being an earthquake on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and actually the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> being destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I was wondering if that affected you or your family of if you remember if this is right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  It was 1933 when the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The books and the Sefer Torah were transported to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that’s because my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">That’s where we usually had our prayers for Shabbat and all the other events were taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Many died in the earthquake. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Other people stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">After this is when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> to continue my studies with the nuns.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  There had actually been a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> — at the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> — and that’s why you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  No <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was small and the existing <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I stayed five years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> ; I lived at an <span class="BUILDING">aunt’s home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">There were many girls living there too — cousins who emigrated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodesia</span> in 1938, which was when I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  How long was the trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  In those years, there were small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and it took five-six hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Today, with modern <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , it is much faster.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Before you were deported, the Germans, as I understand it, were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> from September of 1943 until you were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What kind of encounters did you have with the Germans 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  The relation with the Germans was very good, because, I mean— normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And there was nothing against us on behalf of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And it was only after the Hitler coup (assassination attempt) that the Germans had to carry out some of the orders they received and round up the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But until then, the relations were good, and I think that maybe we were among the last Jewish people that were free in the world at that point in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  And so it sounds like you did not experience anti-Semitism from Germans who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Is that — am I understanding correctly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  There was no contact with the Germans because the lifestyle of the people on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> was very different from on the mainland. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So we had our way of doing things, and we were not having any life together with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Plus, the Italians were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">In Europe, it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The deportation for us was very hard because we had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We had never felt anything before that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And the difference in Europe, where they had to hide, where they were feeling things growing bit by bit... we had no feeling of that kind on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , so it was even stronger for us — the shock — because suddenly everybody was rounded up and we had to be deported and we were wondering why and where— where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Because we had never felt anything of the war until then, except for the racial laws, but we had attributed that to the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Do you remember exactly when the Germans came in, in September? </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Do you actually remember any particular day or was it not very monumental?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  At some point in time the Germans arrived, but they were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so they were mainly staying in their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So we didn’t really feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">When the British left the <span class="REGION">area</span> , then the Germans arrived mid-September. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We didn’t feel it much, but after the deportation, my mother found out from the Mother Superior knew that the Italians had been trying to defend the king’s idea and kind of do a resistance against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And at that point in time, the Germans took some of the Italians prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But I only found out after the deportation (?), </span><span class="sentence" id="210">the Mother Superior told me when I went back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , that the Germans had taken some Italian officers prisoner, and they had asked one officer to dig a kind of a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground, and they shot 300 of them. [</span><span class="sentence" id="211">The number of officers executed was actually about 100. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">|
QUESTION:  That’s on Kos, as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Is that what you either refer to or ve seen mentioned as a massacre on Kos?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  All this time before being deported, and especially after the Germans arrived, was your father still able to do his work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  Yes, but less than before. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">In early afternoon he’d come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we were staying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  I think we’ve covered most of the time period up until September 1943, when the armistice was made official. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So I’m curious to know what you noticed right away when the Germans were coming into your <span class="REGION">region</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  There were, at some point in time, a lot of bombs being dropped around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> by the Allies and what we did, we went with the family and other people to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And that’s where the Germans came to arrest us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  That’s all the way in July of 1944, is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  When they rounded us up on July 21, 1944, they lined us up in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">governor’s palace</span> , and we stayed there for 24 hours without food or water. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And we thought we were going to be kept somewhere on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , as a kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prisoner camp</span> of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We had no idea what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It was a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Germans came unexpectedly and circled our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , said all of us would have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We prepared our suitcases; the Germans told us to bring not too many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We were about 500 people, about 30 families. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It was at that point in time that the Mother Superior came with the music teacher and with some official paper from the German commandanture to have my mother exempted and stay on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But my mother decided that she wanted to go where her family was going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  How would your mother have been able to be exempt? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">What was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  My mother would have been able to because — the Mother Superior said that she was a sick person and she had to be treated before being sent away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  And that was actually fabricated by... or was that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  It was not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">At that point, the Mother Superior realized that we were going to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">She didn’t know where, but she realized what was happening, and she tried because my mother did a lot for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">She tried to at least save her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  Did you know of any resistance activities going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  No, not to our knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Now I think, if you’re ready to discuss, maybe you can tell me some more details about the deportation, as much detail as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The very first that you heard of anything that was going to be happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">How many people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , there were 2,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Maybe you’ ve already said this, but was it done in different stages? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So they gathered, I had read somewhere they gathered men first and then women and children, or was that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Was it different in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> we were all gathered together. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> that they took men first and the next day women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Then we boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , two from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piraeus</span> (Peiraiéfs), where we arrived nine days later on August 2, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It was very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I was with my family on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , which was much better than being in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ’s <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Tape 2, Side A
QUESTION:  On the last tape, we were talking about the details and the specifics of the deportation and I would like to continue if we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  We left on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> — one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> — and the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> joined the one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It took nine days to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piraeus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There were some Allied forces in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Also when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , the Germans had said that nobody could be in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and everybody had to be <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because they didn’t want the people to see the deportation happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So when we left, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was totally empty in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and we thought it looked like a desolated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , the Germans had told the population the same thing, so everybody was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and nobody was supposed to be in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> to see people arriving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  What was it like on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> where you were being transported? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Explain maybe the situation and the environment, how many people there were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  It was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It was a bad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We had already started in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Some of the people were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , but a lot of them were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ’s hold and had no water or food. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Even on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , there was not much to eat, and it was also the month of July and it was pretty warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So it was hard conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">When we came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the Germans had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> to transport us, and they brought us a few kilometers away from the <span class="DLF">port</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">military barrack</span> that had been abandoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaidari</span> and we stayed there for two days with no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We felt as abandoned as beasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The next day, the first day we were there, there was no water, so it was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And then the next day they said we had to go out in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> because they had to inspect us and our luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">After we went in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , they looked through our luggage and our personal things, and they took whatever they wanted to take, and at that point in time we had to get on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">My mother and aunts were already on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , but my father and I were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Then an SS German with his whip started to beat my father, but we didn’t know what he wanted because none of us spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">That was very hard, having no knowledge of the German language. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Basically, the German wanted my father’s shoes and so finally we understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">He wanted to take the shoes and bring them somewhere else, but we didn’t know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And that’s when my father started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I had never seen my father cry before all the harassment he went though. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I stated in my book that “Olympian Nazis needed Jewish shoes for their Aryan feet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> made up of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> (<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> ) was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They kept families together. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> had about 60 people in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We didn’t know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ’s destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">In this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , there was a barrel with water, five loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, and some raisins. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But the water was put in a barrel that was used for pickles, so the barrel was very salty, and with the movement of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the water became completely salty, and it was even worse after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We were very thirsty, and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would arrive to a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , I could hear the sound of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I would try to look out through the small <span class="DLF">opening</span> high up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and yell for water, but to no avail. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The trip lasted around 15 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went though <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovokia</span> , and finally <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  During the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, what were you talking about, with either your family or other people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  During the time we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we were not really feeling like talking much, because we were worried and we didn’t know what was going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And every two to three days, the Germans would stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they would have people go out to— to do their— to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> in front of them and they were standing there next to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And also when they used to open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and people were coming out, sometimes there were some dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They would just take them and throw them in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Those older people that had not survived because of no food and no water and they couldn’t hold on, they were just being thrown. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then they would close the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> again and continue the journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And also for the bodily needs we had, there was in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , a lady with a kid, and she had a small night pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So we all were using it and throwing out its contents through the little <span class="DLF">window</span> on the top area of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We spent 15 days as beasts, not feeling like human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">After 15 days we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , an unknown name for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">When we came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the Germans told us not to take our luggage, to leave everything in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But we thought we wanted to have something to change into, since we had been in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for so long, so we started to put clothing, one piece over another. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We piled them onto ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">When out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> we saw a big <span class="DLF">line</span> of German Officers, well dressed and clean, and we wondered, “Why are they there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Then we started seeing a <span class="DLF">line</span> , and that they were starting to split young people from old ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I was with my mother and in order not to be separated, I put a scarf over my head and started walking like an older person, holding my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But one of the German officers saw this, and he lifted my head and saw that I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So I was separated from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">At that point my mother said, “If you have to split me from my children, you might as well kill me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="315">My mother and father, other older people, and young children, were in another <span class="DLF">line</span> and that same night they were gassed and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I and the other young people were put in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and for the first time we found water. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It was a place to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They threw us packs of clothes that were not matched in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We were also totally shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But after so many days, we finally had water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask one more thing about the deportation itself and the transportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I was wondering, did you know people who died along the way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">My uncle Yehuda Netrike (ph) and Mr. Michael Menashe. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They were thrown out on the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So were many other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  Also I was wondering, do you know, was it everyone from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> — every Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> — who was taken in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, all. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">All the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Nobody was left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  And was that one of the first realizations you had that as a Jew you were being singled out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Maybe before I did not understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , when we were all from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> yes, we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The language barrier was very hard, because even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> when we received orders, we did not understand them, as we did not know any German. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And that was a big tragedy for us, as we didn’t want to do something against the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Sometimes we were doing the opposite because of what the guards wanted and that’s why I think language... People should learn languages, as the world is very big. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">After the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and clothing, we had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There were 30 in six lagers (<span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="339">There were 300 people in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and three levels of wooden shelves — or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> — the majority occupied, so we did not know where to go to spend the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We did not understand what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But somehow, we found a few <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Lights off. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It was night and cold, but we were very tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We were woken at 5 a.m. for the appel, when everybody was counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We stood in rows of five with few clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I was wearing a blue silk skirt and a man’s pajama shirt, with no underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The shoes were wet after being immersed in disinfecting liquid. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">We had to stand for an hour until 6 a.m. Then we were given coffee, which was just water with color but warm, served in dirty tin cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was the same for the 12 noon soup — warm with some potato peelings and some grains. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">These were served <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Then we had nothing to do; we were free in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The latrines were in a big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , with a long line of <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Some women stayed in there for a long time, since it was warmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But the guards with their long brooms would throw excrement on their heads so they would go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">There was a lot of misunderstanding because different people spoke different languages and came from varied cultures. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We did not understand each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">To keep warm, women were asked to join others standing against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> , maybe 20 together, to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We felt like dogs, staying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> having nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The soup came for the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The new arrivals might not take it, but the ones who were there for some time would take it for themselves — it was important to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Also, we saw piles of naked women cadavers being transported by women. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">In the afternoon, there was another appel and counting. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">There was distribution to each of us of about 200 grams of black bread, 10 grams of margarine, and one slice of sausage. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We put the margarine on the bread with our fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">A deportee from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , called Magda, who was 14 years old and had lost her whole family, was a kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">On some evenings, she distributed jam. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">She picked it up with a spoon to throw on our bread, but many times it ended up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and many took it from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">People were very upset with her and it seems that she was killed by prisoners at liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">After we ate, we entered the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">In my mind, I had many questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I was sad, but I knew I must sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">One day, we were told to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">We left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in formations surrounded by old soldiers from the Wehrmacht and dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It was cold and foggy. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">The soldiers asked us to sing Italian songs — one song composed by Beniamino Gigli: “Mamma.” </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We sang and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">We arrived at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and were told to pick up one brick, which we carried out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and the next day we returned it to the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">It was demoralizing work — no need to think, only to get tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It was work similar to that of beasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">In the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , surrounded by electrified wires, we saw people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , men and relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They looked bad — shaved, and dressed terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We gave the same sad impression to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They worked in <span class="DLF">mines</span> , salt and coal, all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">My brother Dave, 25 years old, was there, and a week later developed pneumonia and went to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I went there and called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">He came out and said, “I’m sick.” </span><span class="sentence" id="388">On Friday, we got a bowl of soup for three people with three potatoes, which I saved to take to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I called and called, but he did not come. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">A nurse came out and told me not to think about my brother anymore, and also said, “You should eat your potato.” </span><span class="sentence" id="391">During the night, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had come to take the very sick ones who could not work anymore, and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Years later, after liberation, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , I had a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I saw my brother with a long white shirt and he said, “You, you’ll live!” </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And I never forgot this. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The daily life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I already mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The stronger ones did not let us pass to get water to wash our

QUESTION:  Id like to go back and just catch up with a few details about your arrival to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I’m curious especially, from the things that I’ve read, about the dates that you were in transport to get there and what date you actually arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> on the 23 of July and arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piraeus</span> on August 2™. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Two days later I went on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on August 16".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  I wanted to address the specific date because there are actually a few things that I’ve read, some people who I think were also from the same <span class="REGION">region</span> , who said that they arrived on August 17", and I just wanted to make sure and maybe you have some reason for how that might have come about , this discrepancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Why, it seems like I’ve seen some things that say August 16" and some that say August 17".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  I’m sure it was the 16". </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But you know we had no calendar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  And when were you assigned your prisoner number, especially, that is, receiving the tattoo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  We got the tattoo three days after we arrived and we were very surprised to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It was— some of us tried to just take 1t away, but 1t was done with ink and with a little pen. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And some of us tried to take it off, just a little bit, but 1t was still there, and we were surprised because they say, well this is only for prisoners, like in the <span class="BUILDING">French prison</span> or penal colony of the <span class="REGION">French island</span> that was overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And we were very surprised we were having this. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We also said, in a certain way — not that we are lucky, but at least they did it on the arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They could have done it on the cheek or on the forehead, and nobody would have stopped them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  When did you actually realize that your other family members had been killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  At the beginning, when we didn’t really know — at some point in time, the people that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="415">people, the ones that were directing the other prisoners, were telling us (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="416">these are flames, these are— We kind of understood they were... At the beginning, we thought that the smell we were smelling was the Germans cooking food for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was like a meat smell... that there was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And then we found out that 1t was not, but at no point in time did we want to either know or— or— or be sure that the parents, and the others who were not there, were actually being burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And we sometimes had the feeling that maybe— maybe they were in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And there was a lady from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> that had four children, between 4 and 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Four beautiful kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And she had asked once, “Where do you think my children are? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Are they somewhere else, or did they actually kill them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And the answer was, “Oh no, I’m sure they are somewhere else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But actually, when we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the same night, those kids were with their grandmother — I mean this woman’s mother — and they were together with the grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They took them, so we never really knew what happened to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  Were you actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And what block number were you in, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  It was <span class="BUILDING">Block 20</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">The first night, we were 300 young women from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Were you also around other Jews and could you always communicate in a language with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , we found some— at some point we heard— Some people heard us speaking in Italian, French, and Spanish, so they came over, and they asked, “Where are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We speak French; are you from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And then we said, “No, we come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And the other ones say, “We come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonique</span> (<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaloniki</span> ).” </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And there were people, like some women, who’d been there two years already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  So out of the group that you came with during the deportation — the larger group — how many survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  About 150, mainly women, some men. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">The majority are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  And out of the group of those you were with from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , specifically, how many survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  Only myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  You don’t know of anybody else from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> who survived the deportation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  A cousin Lise, but she was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , and went back there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  But from, originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , the only one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  There was a family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> who moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , but all died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  So, did you mostly have contact with other Greek Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  There were a small number of Greek Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Only three women who approached us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Some were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  Did you ever know of any resistance activities that Greek Jews specifically were involved with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  It is possible that there was, but I didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  Did you then mostly have contact with other women prisoners, more than any men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  We had no contact with men, we were always separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Contact was prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Were you able to carry on any cultural or religious activities at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  We didn’t do anything, but we were really amazed to see that there were some Ashkenazi women, who were there for maybe two or three years, and every Friday were taking a little bit of the margarine they were receiving, and they were melting it down and then tried to do a little candle, and light it, and they were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And every week, they were doing that and I was amazed that they were doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They were organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And also in order to make some kind of a candle, they were ripping little threads from blankets and they were using that to do the candles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  You never actually participated? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You saw this but you weren’t involved personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Since the women had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for a long time, the women had the habit of doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But for us, we admired them that even in those kind of moments, they were doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But we were overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But we had a kind of admiration for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The difference was that since the Ashkenazi people were more religious, they had lived mainly in Jewish circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And they were coming either from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and they had been living more in isolation, so they were 1n a closer society and they were used to being among all Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The difference with the Sephardic Jews was that we were more integrated into the rest of the culture and population and various religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So yes, they were Jewish and they were doing the traditional Jewish observance. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But we were not as close to the religion as were these people coming from smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And also because those Jewish people were put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and were obliged to be isolated and interact only with each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  So I’m not sure how you might be able to answer this if you weren’t really seeing other men prisoners, but I’m interested in the differences between how women and men were treated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I don’t know if you have any perspective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  The work that was given to men was a lot harder and more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They were going to <span class="DLF">mines</span> and they would carry two great stones, so they had a much harder life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> also, of the survivors that came out of our group, most are women. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">There are maybe only five or six men of the 150 that survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  I think that I saw, or I think I remember in what you were saying before, something about contact you yourself had with SS or with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> or, you know, other, and I was wondering if there is anything else you didn’t’ say about your personal interaction with those people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  An extraordinary thing happened to me when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I was working at the time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washing rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">There were four women in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washing rooms</span> and we were washing blankets from dead people or sick people and all the dirty clothes that were from the people who had died, also from diseases, with lice and with— We were obliged to wash about 60 blankets a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I was washing then. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And at some point in time, there was an officer that came in with other SS and they had their handkerchiefs on their noses because the smell was unbearable in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They said, “Keep washing and working. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We are doing an inspection.” </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And this officer, at some point in time, looked at me and asked in French, “Where are you coming from?” </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So I said, “I’m coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ,” because that’s where I was coming from at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I was then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And the officer asked, ““Where are your parents?” </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And then I said, “They stayed in... they stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And then after that he asked if I wanted to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">No, he asked first, ““What were you doing before?” </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And then I said, “Certainly not that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Then he looked at me and he said, “I can see from your hands,” because I still had good hands at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Then he asked if I wanted to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work, because there was food and it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So I said, “Oh, yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Then he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And that evening he sent a prisoner, a guy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , who came over and gave me a pack with sugar and salami and some margarine and bread and he said, “Don’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">This is the officer sending you that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And for a few days, every day he sent that with the prisoner and then at some point in time, the kitchen chief (an older political prisoner interned in 1933) came and said, “You come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I received orders that you are to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And later on, I saw the officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He was a doctor and he was working at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I tried to smile to him, but he put a finger on his mouth and he kind of made a sign not to say a word about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And so I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with my cousins Sara and Notrika and with another lady named Estela Levy. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was of course the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, but also, a few days after I left the laundry to begin working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , they closed the <span class="INT_SPACE">washing rooms</span> because all the women working there died. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Some became crazy and the others got typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">They all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So I was really lucky to have survived because I was saved by this officer, which is for me an amazing story. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And that was the only contact I had directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">At some point in time, they closed the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> because there were more and more bombings around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> because it was getting to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The Nazis were getting more and more scared, and there was hardly anything to eat because they couldn’t get any food for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And they were giving us a piece of bread for 18 people and the bread was usually half- molded because it was so old. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And so one day they asked us to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to go pick up some potatoes in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> because ... There was no more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was raining steadily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  When did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> and how did that come about, going from one to the other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  At some point in time, they called us from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were and we had to go out and we had to be in <span class="DLF">line</span> without clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And we had to pass in front of a medical team. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Among them was Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So we were very scared because there was another selection happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And a woman that was in front of me, one girl that I knew, who had been burned when she was a little kid by oil in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she had a scar around the neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">She was a beautiful woman, but she had just that one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And they didn’t know — the Germans — if it was an infection or something, so they put her on the side where the people were to be killed, because they thought it was a disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">My cousins and I were still around the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> at the time and I had taken a beet and I had looked for them in the <span class="DLF">block</span> , but in the bock there was nobody anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I got very scared, so I ran and I saw them in <span class="DLF">line</span> and I said, “Put the beet on your cheek, so you will look good, because we are passing in front of the doctor.” </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So that’s what they did, and actually it was good for them because they looked so healthy, suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">After that, they threw us another pack of clothes, and with that we went to another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">That day of selection was October 26, 1944, and from there we went into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we traveled for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They most likely selected those who could still work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We arrived in <span class="BUILDING">Klaffering station</span> and were divided into two groups: one to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> and the other to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">At that point, they told us to pick up coats that had been thrown on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They told us to put the coats on and then start walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It was night, and it was cold, so we put the coats on and started walking for the whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And while we were walking, we were kind of feeling like there was sand on us, but we kept on. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We saw the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know, with lights and people far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We saw the dogs and things and we kept on walking all night, and we still had this sensation that we didn’t understand, something that felt like sand on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Then, when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , all the lights were very bright in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And then we saw the officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">They were healthy, and in their uniforms, and clean, and they were in a <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">They asked us to throw the coats on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and when we took the coats off, we realized they were full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And our whole bodies were full of lice because basically what they wanted— They had no way to transport these coats with lice, so they had us carry them over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Tape 3, Side A
QUESTION:  Could you give me an idea about how it was that this group of prisoners you were part of was deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Why do you think it was at a particular time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not too big, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , so what they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they just chose, did a selection and picked some of the people to work in some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> so some went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , others went to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">That’s why they did the selection and took randomly, people to go in one or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The Germans wanted to get the people out of the camp because the Russians were advancing, and the Nazis didn’t want anyone to see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And then the plan was just to blow the <span class="NPIP">place</span> up and blow up the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , but they didn’t have the time before the Russians arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Were conditions very bad at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  For me it was not difficult because at the beginning I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washing room</span> , so I had a double amount of the regular food that they were giving to the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And after that, I was lucky to be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But for the other ones, some of them that came with me, they were obliged to go, they cleaned the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> or went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to cut wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  How many prisoners were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  I stayed there for almost six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I worked in the washing room, then the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Then the Allied forces came in from the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  What date were you liberated? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And when did you — so we don’t lose the dates — when did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and the next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  We were sent to pick up potatoes as it rained heavily, and that was when we said no for the first ttme. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The guards came back with a bucket full of excrement, and threw it at us, saying “Pig Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="562">It was very cold, but we had to go out to wash ourselves off in the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Two days later, there was an evacuation, a long march -- not a death march, but a long one: three days and three nights, sleeping at night on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Where were we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It was terrible, filled with leftover people from many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Was it the end of the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">There was no food; we went the night without food. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Then a walk to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alach</span> , and we were liberated from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There was intense Allied bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They were very close and we were ordered to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">In the morning when we came out, no Germans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">What had happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Did they leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">On the men’s side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> there was no movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We walked through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">We entered in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that had been occupied by German guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , food, even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I played from the Butterfly Opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Then we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and thought: they’ve come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We were trembling but going out we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">The soldiers were not speaking German, and they said “Hello.” </span><span class="sentence" id="584">They were Americans finding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and liberating them. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Everybody was hugging. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The soldiers gave us things: food, chocolate, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">We stayed there about one month before evacuating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  What date were you liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  30 April 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , we were grouped by nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">It was April but maybe not that exact date. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We received double food. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">In <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolzano</span> , where we stayed one night in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , then toward the south to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> where the great <span class="BUILDING">Military Academy</span> was located. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had been destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  I wanted to find out, right after the war, when you started going to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , how was your health and were you in this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because you were not well? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And when did you get well? </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Or can you clarify what you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  My health status? </span><span class="sentence" id="599">No, these were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">We were not sick, just miserable and skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">The Americans found Nazi women’s uniforms and we wore them. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> were full. </span><span class="sentence" id="603"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trucks</span> were sent for different <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Finally, a woman from the Red Cross asked: Why are you here? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We wanted to know how to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">She told a driver to take us six girls to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">When we arrived only the concierge was there, who was surprised to see six girls in German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> left there by Jews when they got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">The community president came and told us that the Palestinian brigade was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They brought water and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But something incredible happened — they mentioned that they had a “Franco” among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was my brother, Nissim. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He was at the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> and this was something beyond belief. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> and he stayed one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He brought me many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I stayed about a month, and had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I was invited by the Jewish community — Mrs. Weiss from the joint told me that I should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , and she found a person for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was not easy to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> without being able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We six girls found there a girl of 14, who had lost all her family, and we took her under our care. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Her name was Alice Starika. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I had no contact with <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> then, but my family sent some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> , we had an interesting event. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">To get soup, we had to first get a number in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , and since we appeared in German uniforms, we were asked, “Who are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And when we explained, their response was “How can I be sure what you’re saying is true?” </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So we showed the tattooed number. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We ate well and went upstairs to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , we got help from the UN to pay for the pension and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for six women: three per <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The Israelis gave us uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Some of the girls ended up going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and see what was left, which ended up being nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Am I understanding that you returned at that time to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Yes, I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and when I went back, the Mother Superior of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I used to go, she found out and said she was very sad for all that had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And she said there is only one <span class="NPIP">place</span> I should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">She said, “Stay with us,” so I stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> for three months and was taken care of by the nuns for that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  How long were you in the different <span class="NPIP">places</span> you lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and when do you think you made your trip back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  I stayed for one month in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> and for a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> at some point in time, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> , and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> for three months to try to see if there was something that was still there... my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But nothing was there and then in the Treaty of Yalta, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> that had belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> went to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">The nuns who were on the island of Kos had to leave, so the Italian government sent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to pick up all the Italians that were still on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , and I embarked on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , so I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> with the nuns and then after that I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , I got in touch with the man I eventually married, who was an Italian officer in the Italian army whom I had met in Kos many years before and we were... we knew each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He was deported as a military prisoner to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so he had different treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I had gotten in touch with his family and asked if they had news about him and found out he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">He was very surprised I was alive and came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And then we got married and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  Did you already specify... how did you decide to go to the particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> that you went first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  My husband’s brother, who was vacationing in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , told us to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brazzaville</span> , where we stayed for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leopoldville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> for 27 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">In 1974 we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  Were you involved in a Jewish community while you were living in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Yes, there were many Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  So there were several other individuals from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  Yes, many. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Mainly Sephardic. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They went there before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  How many other survivors of the Holocaust — of the war — were there with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  About 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Most of the people who survived from this community went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Only a few, maybe one or two of them went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , like Mrs. Dell, a lady that is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now and her sister, who is in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But all the others went to the (then) <span class="REGION">Belgian Congo</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaire</span> and then <span class="COUNTRY">Congo</span> now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  Why did you move from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  Because of my husband’s business. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">The company he was working with closed down and then after four years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brazzaville</span> , a cousin that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leopoldville</span> called us to say, “Why don’t you come here and work with me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leopoldville</span> to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  I want to make sure I get the dates right. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I have that it’s May 1947 to September 1951 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brazzaville</span> , is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  And then September 1951 to July 1974 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leopoldville</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  And then how did you decide to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  In 1960, some people that were working in the <span class="REGION">Belgian Congo</span> went. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They used to send their children to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">1960 was the independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">These people had some links with <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> because they were doing business with <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , since it was a <span class="REGION">Belgian colony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They had some <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So in 1960, most of the people that worked there, of this Jewish community and others, sent their families to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and that’s why some of them stayed there and never left after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I only went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brazzaville</span> during that time — the independence — but later we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leopoldville</span> and we stayed until 1974. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">We left in 1974 because of the nationalization by President Mobutu. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We decided to leave and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> first, where my husband’s brother was living, and then from there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> because we had a lot of friends from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">That’s why we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Tape 3, Side B
QUESTION:  I wanted to ask, because we mentioned this while not recording, a little bit about the community in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and if there are survivors there who had a similar journey to yours?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  Yes, most of them started the same way and they all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and after that some went to certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and others to others, but the beginning part of the story is the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  We have referred a few times during the interview to a book that you have written, and would you tell me when it is you decided to write down your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  [had started the book when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brazzaville</span> at the beginning and then I continued it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leopoldville</span> and when I saw that I was telling some of the story and some people were hardly even listening, or believing in it, I decided I would continue writing because I would at least have it in written format. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And also when I had a daughter, I decided I would continue and write a bit for her, so it would remain for the next generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Then, I left the book there, half-finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And a year later, when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , I realized that some of the people in Europe were kind of talking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> ... Some politicians in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were talking about it like a minor detail of history — as if 1t was not that important. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And then some professors were even saying things like that in <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , so I got very revolted about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I decided somebody, like many others, should put it down on paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">When the commemoration of the liberation of the 50 years of the deportation came, it was 1994. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">In 1994, I said I would also finish my book — as a memory — to all the people that I knew that had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So I finished the book at that time and I added the beginning of the book about the comments of some people in Europe, about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , et cetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  I was wondering if you would be willing to, not only give the title of the book, but would you be interested in just reading a short portion from it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  The title is Un Jour la Joie de Vivre S’arrétat a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uschwitz</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="697">One Day the Joy of Life Stopped at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Written in memoriam of martyrs from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> and Kos. [</span><span class="sentence" id="699">She reads a paragraph]
QUESTION:  Are you aware of any other survivors who have written about their experiences, who are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Yes, a friend, Elisa Franco. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">A good book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  What do you think is the long term impact for you, of the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  It must serve to reflect specifically for the future generations, so it does not happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">The title of my book came from a book by C. Levi.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  I know that you did write about your experiences all the way back when you were living in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> and I’m just wondering, did you speak to other people about your experiences and when did you start telling your daughter about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  I had started the book and then I arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> , and I started telling the story sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I was being asked about it, so I was telling some of the story but I realized that although most of the people were listening, they were not really always believing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">If they weren’t believing, were they really interested? </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Because they were living 1n a surrounding that was very comfortable and very easy and a lot of them had not seen that, so I felt a bit sad about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">But I continued writing my book for myself and then when my daughter grew a little older, then I read to my daughter some of the pieces I had written. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And that’s why later on, my daughter asked me to finish the book I had started, since I remembered the book had already been written and there was not that much more to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  Can you give me the name of your daughter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  My daughter, she’s Marina Garzolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  And I believe you have only one child, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  Yes, I have one child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  P’ve got two more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">One is, what do you remember as your time of greatest fear during all of the Holocaust and war time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  When there were selections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Life or Death?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  And how important has religion been for you since the war has ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  The religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I was born with a religion and I grew up with a religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">When I came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I wondered if... if God really existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">But then with time, I just healed my feelings a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">But to this day, I still wonder why have the people of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and why have the Jewish people been so persecuted? </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And why have they been so punished during their life? </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Even today I pose this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would like to add before we conclude this interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  I thank you very much for interviewing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And also, what I said today came from my soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And I when people read my book, the new generation, I want them to realize that something like that should not happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span>
