<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you start by telling me your name, date of birth, where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  That's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I'm Henry Bermanis. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ventspils</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> on January 5, 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I'm 70 and half years old at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My father was born in 1889. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He was drafted into the old Czarist Russian army in World War I. He was wounded at the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tannenberg</span> , the only battle the Russians really fought in World War I and was a prisoner of war in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria-Hungary</span> for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">It runs in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He came back in 1919, married his childhood sweetheart. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They had very promptly two children, a girl and a boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liepaja</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Then they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ventspils</span> and now they had in this <span class="BUILDING">musical home</span> a future pianist and a future violinist so I had to come along and play the <span class="INT_SPACE">cello</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We were at the cross-culture in that western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , which was heavily influenced by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and Russian, and Latvian and when they wanted to speak so that we wouldn't understand it, they also spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Like I say, it was a very musical <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and then everything -- well, he had some standing timber and a <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span> , and a <span class="DLF">dock</span> for exporting lumber, and he bought all of that on credit after World War I and lost the whole kit and caboodle in the depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So, then he sold everything except our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> during the depression where he sold insurance door to <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My mother went to work as a bookkeeper and we three kids took care of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I was five years old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My sister was five years older, and a brother in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I did my first two years in a <span class="BUILDING">German language school</span> because our last governess was German and we spoke predominantly German. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Before that it was Russian, so I was raised in the classics of both languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="23"><span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> didn't have classics yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So, I wore all the hand-me-downs from my sister and brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was a fairly routine life. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That was 1930 from there until 1934 <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> went through a benign revolution, so- called, and a fellow by the name of Karlis Ulmanis took over as President. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He had his own secret police, which was heavily oriented to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">There were no anti- Jewish campaigns and I lived there in that fashion until 1t came time to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My sister was a secretary to earn some money but she also was predominantly a ballet dancer and did that from age six until the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She died at 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My brother was totally geared to music and finally under the Soviets enrolled in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and studied economics, which is quite alien to his nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">That was a rather peaceful co existence until 1940, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">1940 the Soviets came and converted <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> into a Soviet republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">In 1941 the war broke out for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Before you go any further, now these German language schools you went to I assume they were <span class="BUILDING">public high schools</span> and they were mixed with Gentiles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Any incidents or was that pretty comfortable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  No, before 1938 it was pretty comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">After '38 or just before '38 Hitler called all the ethnic Germans back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the so called Volksdeutsche, people whose families had lived there for centuries suddenly discovered that they were German instead of Latvian. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Some kids in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started to wear the Hitler Youth uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So, there were frequent fist fights after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Never in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it wasn't done. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The pasttime was "Well, let's go out after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and beat the Germans," and they had similar past times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  So you were involved in all of this as a boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Yes, but not very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  It didn't make you concerned, or it did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  There was no prediction of the future, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">On the contrary because we were raised in the German classics, and people who could produce Beethoven's 9th with Schiller's words couldn't possibly do what was being done. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And really until the Kristallnacht of '38 there was no such official program. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, no there was no premonition. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There was some premonition when in 1940 a business friend of my father's, a German from <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> , came to visit us and said, "You must get out of here." </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We had, at the end of the Polish war, we had a joint parade with the Soviets, and we marched 1n formation and you know with the goose-step and all that, to impress the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Then there was nothing for a while, and then we heard this distant thunder. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Then there was this incredible cavalcade of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">T-34 tanks</span> and it scared us. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">You must get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There will be a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Well, we didn't believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So, no there was not really a premonition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Did you come from a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  My mother came from a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My father was a self- professed atheist who thought that his children should attend <span class="BUILDING">religious institutions</span> , <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Pick one that is comfortable and stick with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I'm still looking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  How was life under the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  For us it was an improvement because my father didn't have to -- he wasn't on his own anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He became a bookkeeper for two nationalized industries as a full time job. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He was on salary, and our financial situation improved. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My mother didn't have to work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My brother's <span class="BUILDING">college</span> was paid for, so in that respect at that time, life improved. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It didn't stay that way, but it improved. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It changed just before the outbreak of hostilities between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The Soviets were very confused apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Stalin did not believe that there was going to be a war, that his friend Adolf was going to attack him, and apparently made no preparations for such a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There was on the other hand there was a movement in the Soviet Union to move unreliable elements out of the <span class="REGION">areas</span> where there might be a conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That included certainly <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So, on the night of June 13, 1941, the word got out that they are rounding up people, and it was a memorable night. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was my mother's 50th birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They simply had a list prepared by the NK VD, by the secret police, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army trucks</span> came around and knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and you went with your little satchel via <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and from there to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gulags</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We anticipated being taken because we were classified as former bourgoise, therefore untrustworthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And it was few weeks later on I met a young man in the NK VD who told me that he had taken our paper and put it to the bottom of the pile because he was a college friend of my brother's. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So, that was his favor to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">About that time, my brother was drafted into the Soviet Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He was a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He didn't know which end of a gun the bullet came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Youngsters were shipped off to defend <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> in the coming battles, but since they didn't trust the non-Soviet peoples, the Latvians, with a weapon, he wasn't given a weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, when the Germans did come, they weren't even able to shoot back. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So, my brother was killed near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The exact date and <span class="NPIP">place</span> are unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That was the beginning -- that was just before the war for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I'll spend a little bit of time on life before Barbarossa, before that war, to set the stage, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">What did we do, how did we live? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We had a very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with four <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , five <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We had managed to retain from Ventspils a concert grand, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Steinway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My mother used to play in a rather unique orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Eight pianos played four handed so there was a full sound utilizing what Liszt had done to arrange all the Beethoven's symphonies, for example, for that kind of orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">One of her distant relatives, Maria Solmonovich, was a concert pianist since age 6 and a student of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glazunov</span> , who did her pre-concert exercises, if you will, on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> because it was larger than hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We would sit in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , quiet as church mice listening to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It was uninterrupted pleasure really, except for the concert she gave with Professor Metz, the head of the violin section of the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> , and a young cellist named Aronson. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They played the Tchaikovsky trio which was dedicated to the death of a dear friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Maria died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soviet Gulag</span> , Professor Metz in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and Lev Aronson I found quite by accident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> where he was the principal cellist of the Dallas Symphony and a teacher at the <span class="BUILDING">Southwestern University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">This musical tendency just permeated a lot of our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Like I said, my sister was a ballet dancer and she with four other girls toured the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> giving ballet performances. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So the language was culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The interruption of that culture became doubly painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That was the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My personal tendency, I played the cello. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">My personal tendency was towards engineering and I became the outstanding physics student in my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and that love for physics stayed with me afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My best friend was Alexander Bergmans. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Sasha, as he was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Sasha and I used to hang out together every evening when I wasn't busy with my girlfriend Helga, who was totally adorable, and whom I was going to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It was generally assumed in the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at some later time. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">That kind of existence, rather almost pastoral until things collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Our first indication of things to come was when my father didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We found out that by bribing people that he had been arrested by the Latvian secret police and was held in one of their <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">On the denunciation by the Gestapo in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that he was a British spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">This was very interesting later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It came about because he had a former business competitor in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who wanted to get rid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">In German the in between man between the seller and the buyer is an agent, ein Agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That has a double meaning, and he was quick to utilize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So, we got him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We bribed the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We got him out, but that stayed in our memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, we had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We had to check on each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Except for that one incident, things were "normal." </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Then came the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was very little buildup for Barbarossa, for the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">At least not noticeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There were signs that the governments involved just ignored. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The German attack started on June 21, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Within days the German army had slashed through the rather meager Soviet defenses, and kept going. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">On the way they went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , and with them came the first anti-Jewish regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Now, where were you at this time, what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Well, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was exciting to witness what was going on, just as it was exciting before to listen to radio Warsaw during the German attack when they played over and over again a piece by Chopin: the same piece, until suddenly they went off the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Then we knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was a strange excitement certainly, witnessing history. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We had, ourselves, no premonition of what was to come afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I was in the <span class="DLF">street</span> witnessing it, watching the German army come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="142"><span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> had a very strong pro-Nazi underground, or movement if you will called Perkonkrusts'. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">These people were out in force, of course, waving the swastika and greeting their brothers in blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was a chilling experience but interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Frightening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Not frightening, but scary, a slight difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But again, had we known what was going to happen, we would have been doing other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Under the Soviets we had to declare a spare <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and we received somebody that the Soviet government decided should stay in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He was the director of the <span class="BUILDING">Latvian bank</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When his family arrived, he brought two Russian girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , the head bookkeeper and the head cashier. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They were adorable youngsters, 20, 21 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When things fell apart, when the war began, they urged us to come with them, that they would make room for us in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And we said, no, it's going to pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So, we didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Again, in retrospect, it was very foolish, but 1t was not a normal situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So when the Wehrmacht--the German army--came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , they were promptly followed by civilian administrators from the party and they instituted anti-Jewish regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">You had to wear a star that identified you. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Your passport was stamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You couldn't get ration cards, so you had to finagle your food using up all resources. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You couldn't walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">You had to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , like the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They were basically things designed to set you off from the rest of the population and to reduce your self image, ‘Latvian: Thunder Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Latvian pro-fascist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">and I think that everything the Nazis ever planned to do was centered on reducing your physical resistance and imposing regulations that would detract from you as a person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Was it effective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Oh, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I developed a stutter which I ascribed to that, and it took me quite a while to get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Yes, I think it was effective, at least 1t was in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Not enough to remove me from society. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">A German officer of the German Marine Corps was then billeted in our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , and we quickly became acquainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He had an orderly who was a cute youngster who had been working on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ocean liners</span> all his life, and we became close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">That gentleman wanted our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He got our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and he got a signed receipt that it was given to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I don't know how grateful he was, but he did suggest that my father and I both go to work in his organization in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He was in charge of a German Marine Corps food supply warehouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">A big nine story affair with chilled cooling rooms and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So, we became longshoremen. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My dad and I would walk off to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> every day and work until they closed up and then walk <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They quickly liked my father because of course we spoke fluent German and he was so darn intelligent that he could guess what they needed and tell them what they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I was the guy who dragged the heavy boxes and bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I had two teachers, professional longshoremen who said they were going to make a laborer out of me or kill me in the process, and they did a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I developed physically very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I ate like a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">My breakfast in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was nine eggs, raw, with a half of cup of sugar and a cup of rum. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">That was my breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It went down <span class="DLF">hill</span> from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Low cholesterol. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">It was an existence, abnormal as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Then came an order that all Jews had to move, leave their belongings and leave their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and move to this one part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow suburb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That was in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Once we were all there, they put a barbed wire fence around it and then guards, and it now became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Let me just interrupt you a moment before we get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">In this period after the Germans had entered in June and until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> you were still out in the world a bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had stopped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  What about the people that you knew from before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">What was the local reaction to what was going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Were Jews safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Relatively speaking, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">There were incidents early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">There was the famous Gogol Street synagogue incident where Jews were rounded up on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and locked up in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and then put to fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The ruins of that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> are preserved as a monument to the occasion, but another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> was recently, in June of 1995, was bombed so that the anti-semitic tendencies of the Latvian population are still fairly strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  How did you avoid all of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Were there regular roundups. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Regular violence directed against the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  It was not a "Monday at nine o'clock" kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And maybe it wasn't the incidents didn't have such a high profile. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They weren't repeated so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">There was time in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Somehow I didn't get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">On the <span class="DLF">streets</span> I had a non-Jewish appearance and I when I took the star off I was like everybody else which I did on occasion to go out and buy food and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But no, it was an almost-normal existance except the fact that you weren't totally free. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And the self image of wearing that yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">All that changed with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was -- I think that the Nazis used a very clever graduated program as if it had been orchestrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I rather suspect it was happenstance. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They really weren't that clever, but it evolved with time, and especially after the 1942 Wannsee Conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It took on a totally different measure. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Until then it was not the program to kill all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">That came later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  So you were required to go into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Did you take all your belongings with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">How did you get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  We walked with a little suitcase and went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We moved into a preexisting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span> so there was some pots and pans and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">It was not a desolate desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Did somebody organize your <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> or you just went into an empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  We went into an empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">There were several families in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and no we didn't have sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It wasn't all the amenties of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and it wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and yes, now it began to be scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">When the barbed wire went up it became really scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">When the men who had a job <span class="NPIP">outside</span> came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the job assignment one day, they couldn't rejoin their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They had to go into a different part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> which is blocked off by barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">That became scarier. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But that was still an everyday life, if you will, until the end of November.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Were you still working with your father as a longshoreman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  So you went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> every day to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">There were a number of Jews who worked there at this point and we had a column of workers who marched off to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and came back in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Being that were outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , were there advantages?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Oh, one advantage, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">One was that you were not that vulnerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">In the Nazi hierachy you occupied a useful function. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">That was meager life insurance but it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We didn't know yet that it was a life insurance. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We didn't know what was coming next. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And since we got fed every day, that was an advantage, and I became as strong as a bull with that labor exercise and the supporting food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Did you get information about what was going on since you weren't as isolated as people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We pilfered the German newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We weren't supposed to know what was going on, but you did and discussions with the Germans and the Latvians surely kept us abreast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Were you aware of Einsatzgruppen activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">That came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">The real killing didn't start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> until the end of November.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> itself, you described that there were two parts of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The so called small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> which is where the people came back to after working all day, and then the larger one where everybody else was. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I was in the smaller one. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We had -- we were told to move in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Well, our accomodations were not palatial. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We found a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> with two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It was after all the poorer section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so it was not terribly nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  This is your whole family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  No, this is just my father and I, plus eight other fellows, men. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We all moved together into this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That's all that the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> could hold. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">My mother and sister moved into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and were joined by a young lady, Shasti, who was in my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> class, but they didn't live there very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They didn't live very long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  Did the two parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> have contact with each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  They were not meant to have contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It had a double barbed wire fence and I did sneak through it once, in the first few days of July of '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But the first Aktion--the first mass killings-- took place on the 30th of November 1941 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">As we lined up to go to work that morning, we were faced on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> by 110 special Latvian police and we stood there eyeing each other and one of the cops came over and poked his rifle in my stomach and said, "Look at the sun, tomorrow you won't see it again." </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I didn't know what he had in mind, but that group came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> under SS supervision and under supervision of a man named Cukurs, a Latvian war flying ace. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They took half of the Ghetto population by <span class="DLF">street blocks</span> and forced them out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to line up in the <span class="DLF">street</span> in columns of four or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And they were marched off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumbula</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> slightly further east and south of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">During that day and that night, they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">There were about close to 15,000 people, so there was alot of shooting going on, and I don't believe anybody who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> didn't know what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Could you hear it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, inevitibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Then during the days following that, I managed to sneak through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> one night, and I saw my mother and sister and the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Then everybody knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">My girlfriend was shot and 15,000 other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">There was still about that many remaining and the Aktion was repeated the following weekend, and the rest were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That took care of the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and it left about 2500 men and two women. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was a very thorough expedition. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">There were two ladies in the <span class="BUILDING">Zentralka prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They did not get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And there was a young woman by the name of Frieda Michelson who crawled out of there, out of the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">About a month later, on January 3, as we were lining up to go to work, a group of Gestapo agents came over in their black coats and took my father out of <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">As I found out later, it was a Gestapo arrest, still going back to the old agent of the British business, that former competitor of his didn't let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They took him to <span class="BUILDING">Zentralka prison</span> and he was killed there, or he was tortured to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I don't know the exact date. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That was on January 3, 1941.* </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Now they're all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Life continues. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I continued as a longshoreman and in due course I felt that I had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I was angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I got myself assigned from the longshoreman work, to a <span class="DLF">well</span> first as an electrician for Siemens. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Siemens was one of the German companies, still alive, that was making money out of this free labor for which they paid the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I worked as an installer of electric circuits in private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> under the supervison of a Latvian fellow who was as inexperienced as I was and just an absolute sweetheart, Janis. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Janis came to pick me up one day at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and marched me to the next <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">He had obviously been crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He had been drafted into the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So, we did our work and then we went to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , me on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> as my guard, much to the shock and dismay of his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We sat down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we consumed at least one bottle of vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Then when it became to get back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , he marched me back the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">We're both staggering and singing at the top of our voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">With him gone, I got myself reassigned again. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">This time to the <span class="BUILDING">Powder Tower</span> --the Pulverturm--in the remaining standing part of the fortification of the old city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">In the meantime I had also joined the underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We had a triple cell structure where three fellows would belong to this thing and only one would “Correction of Mr. Bermanis: 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">report to the next one higher to make it basically betrayal-proof. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">We smuggled weapons into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I had some weapons training there, and at the <span class="BUILDING">Powder Tower</span> I had further training. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I became an ordnance expert.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  How did you get the weapons that you smuggled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  These were weapons that the Germans had collected in the battlefields that the Russian army had left behind in retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They brought these things together in the <span class="BUILDING">Powder Tower</span> and tried to reconstruct them into useful weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There were also some Russian PWs, worked in that <span class="BUILDING">Powder Tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That brings me to the Russian escapade. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">One of the Russians from <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> took me aside one day and said that one of their members was a high ranking officer and there were several others like that and I should get in touch with the underground and get them out of there before the Germans found out who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So, I got through the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We organized this. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Somebody stole a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German army truck</span> and uniforms and we became Feldpolizei--military police-- and then just before the action was to take place, one of the ten people in our little group, nine now, took me aside for a walk one day, and said, "You aren't going tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="340">When I asked how he knew about it, he said that he was one of the Committee of Ten who governed the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Jerry Bahn, so he said you have to stay behind and organize the next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Well there was no next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">This one was betrayed, and they all got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">In any case, that thing became a little bit hot for me, and I got myself reassigned out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But we had a good organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  How large of an organization do you think it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  I haven't the slightest idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I can tell you how many people I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That was three. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Unbeknownst to me, there was another underground going on, and that one included all the Ghetto police in the <span class="REGION">Latvian sector</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">These were select fellows, about 50 of them, and I had never looked at them as my buddies because we could not disclose to them our underground or they would have had to stop it because it would have threatened other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">That was the trouble with forming resistance in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">It was not in isolation. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">The retributions, like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lidice</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , was total. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So we had to be very cautious about who knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And it affected my social conduct totally because I didn't trust anybody, and I didn't want to expose anybody to knowing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Well, the Latvian police was betrayed and they were killed by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">For some reason, the sense of humor of the gods, I was not picked out and I started to do very innocuous work, which was probably a life saver, because some of the work at the <span class="BUILDING">Powder Tower</span> was fairly risky. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We did bomb disposal, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I remember one time in <span class="REGION">northern Lithuania</span> there was an encampment of Soviet 105 artilliery that they had left behind and this stuff was damaged and they were scared that people would bump into it and blow themselves up. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, they told us to bring those things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Well, some of them could be brought out. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You could unscrew the fuse and have an innoucuous metal object. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Some of the fuses were obviously damaged and should not be monkeyed with and some were plain too dangerous to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So, what we did, was to unscrew the good ones and put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crates</span> and load them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">The others we placed in a circle, 16 rounds of 105 plus two pounds of TNT in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Then we threw a percussion’ handgrenades into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> to scare away the locals. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The Lithuanian police kept them away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Then we had 15 minutes to trade, to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">My speciality was raw eggs, and then we'd get the dickens out of there after lighting a short fuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The *Correction: concussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">explosion was impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And then I would sit on the tailgate of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full of questionable artillery rounds and carefully balancing a bag of raw eggs, worried about the raw eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The German police at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> never bothered us when our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They stayed away from us and that was one way to bring weapons into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  What about the internal police? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Were there Jewish police within?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Well, for obvious reasons we couldn't trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">For the protection of the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> population they couldn't tolerate what we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So, yes, they were the enemy as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">On one of my electrical engineering assignments I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> installing cable and on the way to and from work in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , I met a young Jewish girl from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> who had just recently been brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and there was a very strong attraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You might call it puppy love, I don't know, but we decided we were going to get married after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">That sort of continued until 1943 when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">The people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> were either assigned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> --Arbeitslager--which were subservient to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> was established and I was shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> one fine day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  I want to ask you a few more questions about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Now, what I've heard 1s that only the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Did they ever fill up the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  I'm sorry, I left that out. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Within a week of the second action, they brought in Jews form Europe, from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> mostly and assigned them to take over the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">One lady told me that 1t was a horror because the food in some cases was still warm on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They couldn't understand what happened here. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">How come these people so suddenly left. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They didn't believe the obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">After all they were told by the Nazis that they were going to be working in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They wanted to believe it I guess, just like we wanted to believe all the other lies. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So, there was a new population into this larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Some of these folks came straight from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Some of them were really Jewish Germans instead of German Jews; there was one gentleman with the Iron Cross from World War I, proudly displayed, which was torn off. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Any sign of self awareness had to be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Yes, it was a new population. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I did not mix with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">This charming lady, Nelli Stahler, was on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I did not have to pick her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I was not good company. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I was not safe company, so I didn't make myself available as safe company. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I don't know if there was any other mixing. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  What about the daily life the basics in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , the part that you were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Was there any life, was there enough food? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">What was going on there other than working?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Depends on your definition of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">You call that living? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Yes, there was life. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was a community. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">People went out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Some people did not, some people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">There was medical care. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Some people got together in the evening for a musical soirée. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I was not in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I cannot talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">To me, it was a totally abnormal society in every respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I'm not aware of any children being born or conceived for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I just don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  Your part was mostly men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  It was all men, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  Were there any activities, anything other than work, come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , make food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Now, both of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> were under some sort of administration?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  Who were these people who ran the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  There was a Nazi administrator, an SS officer who had a lousy reputation; well earned, I might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He ran it with an iron fist. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Whether he could do otherwise, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It didn't take very much to keep this kind of society alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">It also didn't take very much to destroy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">It was not that cohesive. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">There were people from all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="441"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself didn't have a strong national entity. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">After all it was only Bismarck who unified the German principalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So, the united <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a myth and the love between the Bavaraians and the Prussians for example, was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I was escorted one time through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> by a Bavarian officer, and when somebody blew up an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ammunition train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> not far from us, he jumped from one foot to the other shouting, "Serves the damn Prussians right." </span><span class="sentence" id="445">There was that kind of local chauvinism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was repeated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I have seen it repeated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I don't know how prevalent it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">TAPE #2
ANSWER:  I had as little to do with the administration as I possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I didn't go on sick call because it wasn't healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We did have a small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It wasn't very healthy either. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Whatever supplies I had to have I had with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We did, in our little group of nine, in our <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , we had two people who stole food and brought it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I was one of them so when I quit the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> I had to rely on others. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But it was not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">At that point, food was not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That became a problem later. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So, the administration mostly was German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Not Latvian Jews especially after the killing of the police, and I just kept my distance from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  This one administration ran both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Yes, so we had a sub-administration if you will but yes it was one group that ran the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  Now because this 1s interesting, dynamic, because they were German Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> did that cause any tension, or did everybody get along?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  I am told that it did cause tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I never experienced it, maybe because of the German orientation in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but some of the German Jews told me since then that they felt severe antagonism on the part of people who said "They killed my family so you could move in here." </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Like I said, I did not experience it but I'm told it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  Was it your sense that the Jewish administration and the Jewish police tried to help and support the community or were they corrupt 1n basically saving their own hides?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  I don't think they were corrupt, but their view point was different than mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They wanted to do nothing to antagonize the German administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The less antagonism, the quieter the better they were off. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">People like myself who challenged that obviously were outvoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">All we could do is cause trouble a la Lidice. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So, it was their job to make sure that we didn't exist, that we didn't do these things and it was my job I felt to do precisely that and to be in a position of taking some of them with me when the time came. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I wasn't very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I didn't feel any reason to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But that's Ghettoesque society. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">What an awful term. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">That Ghettoesque society existed reasonably successfully until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Until the Nazis decided to eliminate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> as one step in the control of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  After the actions in the beginning or in the early months, was it fairly quiet then until the liquidation or were there other roundups and actions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  No, it was fairly quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I'm not an eyewitness to what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaspils</span> , but I'm told that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaspils</span> , which was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , that there were medical experiments going on and things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I have no direct knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">The liquidations were performed by Einsatzgruppen. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">In the Nazi hierarchy, the SS was in charge of that particular activity and they relied heavily on local talent to do some of the dirty work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">They found that the German troops were not suitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Their mentality was not suitable for this kind of a mass murder of men, women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I read some <span class="NPIP">place</span> that some of them approached Himmler and complained about needing a break for his troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">That they couldn't take that kind of work any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">One reason it is speculated why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> became an important killing ground was because the Latvian population was anticipated to support the liquidation of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So, that probably will be strongly opposed by some Latvians, but two years ago when the Gogol Street synagogue monument was dedicated, the president or prime minister of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in his statement said that the Jews only have themselves to blame, because after all, they were working for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And that kind of insensitivity to what really happened, in a high government official, does not speak well. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">In any case, in the Nazi approach to the Final Solution it couldn't be done with an undisciplined mob within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The movie Schindler's List was, I thought, an excellent depiction of an Aktion in action. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">People fell through the cracks. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The kids were hiding in the latrines and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It was not a well-organized activity with precision, and that was what was needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">The task of killing that many people successfully is formidable. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The eventual disposition of the bodies also was. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So the Einsatzgruppen became specialists supported by local talent and that's what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I cannot speak for all the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  One other question about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and you got involved in an underground organization, how did that come about? </span><span class="sentence" id="503">How did you get involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">How did you know who to trust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  Well, we didn't trust anybody, that's why we had these groups of three so that any betrayal would have limited consequences. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Subsequently they discovered -- and I don't know who discovered it and betrayed it, but they discovered one of our <span class="INT_SPACE">training rooms</span> , which was rather nicely hidden underneath a movable <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Underneath there was a <span class="DLF">cavern</span> , and it was very well done. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We did learn how to use weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We didn't fire them there, but we learned how to use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">By my activities in the <span class="BUILDING">Powder Tower</span> I did know how to use a weapon and learned even better. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">No, you couldn't trust anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  You were just talking to some of your colleagues and said "Let's fight back"? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I mean, how does this get started?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Well, I let it be known that that was my mind set and eventually I was contacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Interestingly there were two undergrounds in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">One was the Nationalistic one, the one that wanted a free <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> but had no arms in to succeed 1n itt, so all they could do is pray that someday the Swedish navy would liberate them, which they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Another one was the one that was pro-Soviet and worked very closely through the communist party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> with the Soviet partisans who were mostly the ones near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tukums</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Daugavpils</span> , two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They were very effective. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The civilian Latvian police, if there is such a thing, left those people alone because if they went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with their arms in their hands they got shot at. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">If they had them on a sling on their shoulder, they were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So, it was sort of a mutual admiration society. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">My subsequent contacts with the underground were with an agent who worked with the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet radio station</span> , <span class="BUILDING">clandestine radio station</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tukums</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  Was there an overriding ideology or did you have goals? </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I know you were trying to bring in weapons, but what were you going to do next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  Kill Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Anywhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Well, clearly we were all motivated to exact revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We had all lost our families, every one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So, our mind set was to avenge something. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The professional undergrounder, the Soviet organizers, they couldn't stand that because that took control away from them and they didn't want any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So they were at cross purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">There were different motivations. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Mine was to damage the German war machine, to damage the German effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">To do something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Was there a where and when, do you know what I mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  No, it wasn't that well organized and the elimination of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and the move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> brought a halt all of that for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> continued lively. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">When I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> in the early summer of 1943, I was again in very strange surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Do recall, if you will, the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , no matter how crazy, it was still a civilian existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">When you moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , you became a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">You lost your identity as a human being, and so that changed your perception of yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It changed the Nazi perception of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We were so many pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I didn't stay long in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , just long enough to get my nose busted, but that was an even more abnormal society. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">The importation of the German Kapos, the German professional criminals who became the ears and eyes and hands of the Nazi administration, they did the dirty work. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They were not Jews, and whatever feelings they had about Jews was not pertinent. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I didn't stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> more than a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was enough not to like the <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Because you ceased to be a human being and because it was dehumanizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">For example, one of the betrayers in the camp was found drowned in the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> upside-down. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">That is not the normal proceeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">We had one gentleman by the name of Einstein who was a head Kapo in a smaller camp somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> ; when they destroyed that camp he was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> and we knew that he had actively collaborated with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So we held kangaroo court in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> at night and persuaded him to hang himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Well, we tried to persuade him, he wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He was -- why would he kill himself, but after two weeks he snapped and he went after the <span class="DLF">fence</span> with a set of manicure scissors and he got shot by the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It was that kind of abnormal society. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">There was some other work going on and we were fed reasonably well, comparatively well, comparison with later food. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">But it wasn't that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It was a --in all respects a totally abnormal society. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">At this point, I was about 18 and, heck, I resented it. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I resented everything that had gone before that and that was still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I was very soon assigned to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">branch camp</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">cement factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">As a matter of fact <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> had a large and reasonably modern <span class="BUILDING">cement factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They were short of people, so they got the SS to give them some Jews, and I became a maintenance electrician in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  Do you remember the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Zement Fabrik</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568"><span class="BUILDING">Cement factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It was on the left bank of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Daugava River</span> that goes through the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It was hard work, but it was not without some humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">It was not without some human contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I met two people there who were important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">One was a fellow prisoner, also an electrician, who just had a couple teeth left. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He had come from the <span class="BUILDING">Zentralka prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When I asked him of my father he knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">The other one was a young man by the name of Dute. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Arvids was about my age, came from a <span class="DLF">farm</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tukums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">He was a totally dedicated communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Had gotten his whole family to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> because of it and he was still pursuing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">He had a furnished <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">cement factory</span> and he gave me some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He was a delightful man, a truly delightful dedicated fighter whether you share his philosophy or not, his politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">That assignment lasted for about -- by the way that other prisoner confirmed that my father had been tortured to death but he couldn't tell me when or how. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">When that assignment closed, they closed that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">branch camp</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , I was assigned together with the others to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> used to be the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The Germans modernized it, enlarged it, and 1t became the main tactical Luftwaffe--German air force-- support field for the northeastern operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So, as long as they could fly, they flew out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  It was administered by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Did you live at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> or did you live at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Call that living. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">sleeping quarters</span> , were in an abandoned old <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">It was not designed for the purpose so some of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and facilities were not very suitable but they had a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around it and it was administered by somebody we called the "Eiserne Gustav'"--the "Iron Gustav"--a perverted gentleman in the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">No pretty girl who was safe for the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Or boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">But 1t worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I was an electrician again, on the <span class="DLF">airfield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">They clearly didn't have enough guards for all of us so they had guards around the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">It was a leaky <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And there were times when I had a civilian suit from Arvids in one of the <span class="BUILDING">substations</span> that nobody would go in because of high voltage. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I would put that on and go an look up my friend Arvids during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I gave him information about the Luftwaffe--the German air force--the disposition of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And he instructed me how to sabotage the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, I was able to get into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hanger</span> and unsecured the oil drain plug cotterpin and then watch to see if that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> would make it back or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Sometimes it didn't so I shot down a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We also handled bombs and we found out that there was a way to secure the bombs so they wouldn't go off. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So we all did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But my main function was as an electrician and that was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I was also able to steal some personnel documents, ration cards, and passports and so on and I.D. cards and get them via Arvids to the paratroopers in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">All in all I felt very successful and so did the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So, in 1944 with the return westward of the Soviet Army there came a point when they said you've got to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We have to save you. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was around May or June of 1944 I had a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> and I told him -- I told the underground first that I couldn't leave without him because obviously he would become a hostage under the Nazi system. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The nearest relative or the nearest friend becomes a hostage and, within three days, if he doesn't come back, he's dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So, I explained to him that he had to come and be prepared the next day not to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So, that night he went over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and left me. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So, I became the hostage. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Boris Monastirsky, a fairly unforgettable name. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I was designated as the hostage and within three days I was assigned to Stutzpunkt. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Stiitzpunkt was the work assignment where you went and naturalized, denatured the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">You had to open them up, destroy them with lime, and then close them up again to eliminate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And of course, since you were a witness you had to be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was an assignment of no return.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  You just covered them or you had to cremate them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  Well, you had to open them up, chemically destroy them with lime, and then cover it up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">The decomposition gasses were unavoidable and they raised the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> , they raised the soil. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So, to stop that, you had to either remove the bodies which by then were not easily handled--that is a euphemism, too--and so destroying them chemically in place was the way to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So, I was assigned by the Eiserne Gustav to that detail, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> broke down. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The Germans used at that point <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were lacking gasoline and they used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> that partially decomposed wood and the resulting gasses were combustible. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So, that was in lieu of gas and it raised Cain with the engines so they frequently broke down. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">This one wouldn't even start. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So, I was permitted to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but not go out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So, I became the delouser. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I would take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and clothing that were full of lice and fleas and stuff like that and bedbugs and put them in a <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> and use a bowl of sulfur powder with sawdust and set it on fire and then seal the thing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The next day I would open it up and take the stuff out, shake out the dead beasties and do the next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">This wasn't very healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">You did a lot of inhaling and finally I went to the Eiserne Gustav and said I was on strike and I wasn't doing that any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And he was so impressed with this audacity that he said if you find a guard who will give you his gas mask, you may don it. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">There was such a guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So, that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">The guard in question was half-Polish, half-Scottish, in the German SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">He gave me his gas mask. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He also did the incredible act of sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">guard shack</span> and listening to Radio London and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radio Moscow</span> and then come out and tell me what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Because the front by then was very dynamic. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">He also did an even less credible. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">He and a German lieutenant marched the perimeter of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then the two of them took me around and showed me where there was a weak spot where I could go over the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Totally unheard of that two of those people in uniform would trust each other as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But in any case, one day I was allowed to go out to work under a one-on-one guard to dig an <span class="DLF">air raid trench</span> , and I discovered where I was digging was obviously a <span class="DLF">field cemetery</span> from the Swedish-Polish war of 200 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And I found a lot of wonderful skeletons well persevered in this sandy dry soil and I put "Charlie" together, a full skeleton leaning against the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">There was a loud laughter after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">The captain of the <span class="BUILDING">German meteorological station</span> which was there, dismissed the guard and he and I ended up using the captain's Luger to plunk at tin cans on "Charlie's" head. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It didn't last long, but it was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">He also showed me the German tactical map and how sparsely they had occupied the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So, the time had come pretty close to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Well, the Nazis did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">They liquidated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spilwe</span> as part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , marched us to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and we were loaded on this one incredible <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and taken on the Baltic to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  When you say you marched to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , were you close to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="659"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">harbor city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Daugava river</span> bifurcates <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> just like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Covington</span> bifurcates Ohio at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> , so, yes, it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">port city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> was, as Bella said, was a horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">It was our first aquaintance with an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> as opposed to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> before in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and, thank goodness, I was there for only a few weeks before being shipped off to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">branch camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Listen to the semantics of that: "Thank goodness I was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> "!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  What was so horrible of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">It was a place to kill a lot of people, starve them into being vulnerable to diseases so that they would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It was not designed as a mass killing installation, but it was designed as a mass death installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So, the conditions, if you will forgive the expression, the living conditions, were submarginal. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">The food was submarginal. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And it was not designed to be survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">That was very unique in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  Did people work there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  No, there was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">There was just dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Everything else was just immaterial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  So, how did you spend your time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">ANSWER:  Partly doing calthestenics. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">That sounds ridiculous, but it was a way to burn off our energy, what was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We had to do push ups and knee bends and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Try doing a knee bend to the count of eight and then stop at three and stay that way for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">That takes energy away from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Anything to destroy you. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">There was one young Russian PW in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> who broke down and took a hammer and smashed his German guard over the head with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">He was executed that night and we had to stand at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appell</span> and watch him hang. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">It was not a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The exception perhaps was a group of Norwegien PWs who were fed by the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They got food packages every week and they sat there along the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and taunted the SS guards by biting into a large salami and then throwing the rest into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dirt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">The Germans didn't have much to eat at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So, the atmosphere was rather deadly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  Was there any commraderie among the inmates like yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Not that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">There was no what they call bonding. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was awaiting death. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And, if you will, at that time we were badly weakened. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We had not been properly fed for a long time and worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">The transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> was not pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">There was a lot of sea sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">There was very little food, almost no food, and no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We were badly emaciated by the time we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and that environment just did the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were thinking at the time in terms of chances for survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  I remember the tactical overlay that I saw that this captain showed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I knew that the Nazi system was coming to an end and I resented the fact that I wasn't going to be there to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I badly wanted to see that, but your thoughts are heavily preoccupied with food and your discussions are about juicy steaks that did not exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It's like "fatah morgana" in a <span class="DLF">desert</span> where you visualize a bucket of water or a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We were not normal, I think, at that point, and our thoughts were not what a normal person would conjecture to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">This is not uniformly so. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">My friend the cellist ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and so did his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">His sister died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But in his words, he had to unload a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with several others at one point, and he was told that if it takes longer than 30 minutes you'll be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Well, we didn't have watches, but being a concert cellist he played in his mind the Saint-Sans Cello Concerto, which he knew takes 23 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So, they unloaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">There were these moments, but in retrospect 50 years later to tell you about my thinking process I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  Mostly you talked about food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  It was a dominant subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And safeguarding what little food you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I mean you got a small food ration every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  Is there any way to get extra food there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  How long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  Oh, about four or five weeks I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  Then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  Then the order came out that they were looking for professionals, and I was an electrician of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I could prove it so I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Anything was better than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and I was put on the transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">There were others, my friend Bella and her husband and several others so it was not as if it were among strangers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  You and Bella went together on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">That was the positive aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">The fact that we were eagerly volunteering for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> didn't come through. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">It was the sign of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">By comparison to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="736"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">branch camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , AuBenlager 101 of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And I again became an electrician.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  Is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> a large <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">How many people were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Oh I'm guessing, I'd say about a half a million. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It was a fair-sized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  How about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  Oh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was small. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Only a few hundred people in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">It was set up to support the <span class="BUILDING">Polte factory</span> ; they made ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Yes, we supported the German war effort, for the love of Pete, reluctantly and only for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Two things interfered. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">As an electrician I had maintenance access to that part of the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">The stampings, the manufacturing process, consisted of large stamps that rammed a disk into an elongated shape, further elongated at other stamps and then it was taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">machine floor</span> in the mezzanine for final drilling and lathing, turning. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> therefore became a key in the transport and I was able to destroy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It had two wheels which were driven by a large motor and I overrode the security system and drove it beyond its limits and broke the two rails that handled the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">The chief engineer of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polte</span> formed a committee to find out why it had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">They decided it was sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">That evening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I told our head Kapo, Dave Kagan, what had happened, and he gave me a new number. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">The chief engineer, you know, You see one prisoner, you've seen them all, and he went by the number and I had a new number and he couldn't find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So, my Kapo saved my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  Now, why was this Kapo so benevolent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  He was a nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">He did his work, partly to make sure that the Nazis did not administer us directly because they could beat us more than he could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">QUESTION:  Was he German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">ANSWER:  He was a Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I don't know what part of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">He eventually came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  So some of the Kapos were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I have no statistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But in any case, that slowed down the transportation from one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">The other thing is that the allies conducted air raids of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> every night at ten minutes till nine the armada flew over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , and then we stood there and waved goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Then one night they stopped and, on the third of January 1945, they blitzed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">They destroyed a good part of it and moved on. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">That pretty well wiped out the productivity of Polte. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">After that they did one more massive bombing raid and that totally wiped it out and after that we just cleaned up debris in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">There was no sense working in the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Also, somebody had very good intelligence on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> because when the utilities to the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> were brought back to life, the <span class="BUILDING">compressed air station</span> , the water works or the transformer, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> would peel off that night from the armada and wipe out that <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> and move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">There was very good intelligence apparently, by somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">It was delightful to watch, but that was the end of productivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Now when you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> cleaning up debris, did you come in contact with the local population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I had no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">They pretty well stayed away from us and vice-versa and there were guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">The German administrators had a difficult time with some of the cleaning up because there were bodies around. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">There was one bomb hit right in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> of an <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> housing a large number of Hitler Youth kids, and the air shock dismembered everybody in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So, we had to go in and pick pieces of bodies and try to match them up by shoe size or things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">People didn't like to be with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">It was pretty gory. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And you really couldn't jump for joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">These were kids, no matter what uniform they wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">That was in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">April 11th came around and Patton's Third Army people came around and approached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">On Eisenhower's instructions they did not go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">They didn't want to meet up with the Soviets before they were ready to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They didn't want to end up shooting at each other so there was a hiatus. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">The Americans approached and then held back. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">The German SS disappeared, reappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I hid among some old discarded clothing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They came through with dogs to find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I don't blame the dog for staying away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I had a terrible nervous digestion at that point, and even the police dog could not stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">They caught me twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Once I crawled underneath some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They found me there; and then I escaped to the plant itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">As an electrician I knew where everything was, so I was able to hide out successfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And I stayed there until the American army was firmly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So from up there, near the top of the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> , I saw the white flags of surrender and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I went shooting down the <span class="DLF">fire escape</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">This poor G.I. I'll never forget his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I was an unpleasant apparition. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But life came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">QUESTION:  What happened to the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">ANSWER:  They surrendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  They just surrendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  Were there any attempts that you noticed to retaliate against them by prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  There was only one case where an SS man, now in civilian clothing, who had originally been in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and had a little Polish flag in his lapel. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He was recognized and the prisoners beat the devil out of him, and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> with an American war correspondent. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He said wait a moment, wait a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Do that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I haven't got it on film. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">So the poor guy got beat twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  I'm sure you weren't weeping for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">His name was Shuller. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">He wasn't very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I was at that point emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I weighed about 80 pounds and I had to put some weight on. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">The American troops that came in had been on C-rations or K-rations for months and all they wanted was some warm food and I ended up cooking pancakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I don't know how many hundreds of pancakes I fixed until those troops left. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Then the British army moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> and in the meantime I had been looking for that chief engineer who had been so incredibly unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">When the SS pulled out, he patrolled the plant with his dog and tried to find his old slaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So, I found out where he lived, talked to his neighbor, a charming lady and her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And they promised they would tell me when he comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">He had fled to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">So one day they told me that he was back, and I went after him with a very unpleasant looking knife, a "pig-sticker." </span><span class="sentence" id="834">He was thoroughly intimidated, came with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I took him to British Field Security Office--<span class="BUILDING">FSS Office</span> --and turned him over to the sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And then I had to fill out the form, and he looked at it and he said, "Are you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="837">and I said "Yes." "</span><span class="sentence" id="838">Do you have an uncle by the name of Aaron?" </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I said "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He said "Well, we used to do business together." </span><span class="sentence" id="841">He said "Don't worry about that guy, but as for you, don't talk about it to anybody, but we are changing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupation zones</span> and the Soviets are coming back here. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So, if you don't want to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , get out of here." </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I told Bella and her husband that, and this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravan</span> soon thereafter left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Five of them in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , my sidekick and I, each on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I had purchased from the chief of police an I.D. card identifying me being born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I didn't speak French, but neither do the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">That worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Just in case they find me they'd have to send me back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I was fine until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuwied am Rhein</span> , which was initially in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and was then taken over by the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And they were concerned about this Frenchman who refused to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So I had to leave and the rest of them left at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  Now, just logistically: you spent the last several years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Clearly you don't have belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">You don't have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">How does one get around? </span><span class="sentence" id="856">How did you purchase the fake I.D. How did you get from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  Purchasing the I.D. was a box of American cigars. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">That is an open currency, cigars and cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">The Germans gave each former prisoner a double ration card and enough money to buy the food on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">That still wasn't very much, but I went back and having a card saying I was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polte camp</span> was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">It was so nice, I went back twice more. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Now, I had three I.D. cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Three sets of ration cards and money to buy three sets of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I was swimming in food. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I needed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I needed that food very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Also, we liberated--we stole, or broke open--a <span class="BUILDING">food supply warehouse</span> for the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> and we, the ex-prisoners and the German civilians helped ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I came back to our pad with a barrel of 25 kilos--50 pounds--of butter and a bag of flour and I went into the pancake business. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">No, getting the food at that point was not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And eventually I doubled my weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I became fatso. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">In the summer of 1945 I rebuilt my system. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It didn't take too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">It was boring after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I felt the need to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And after Neuwied, when we got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , I went one night to a <span class="BUILDING">German bar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I did a lot of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I became the youngest alcoholic on record I think, but drinking my booze in that <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> there was a G.I. who was fairly lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">He and I had a conversation of some kind in pidgin German and pidgin English and he asked if whether I had any relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> , and I told him that when I was two weeks old an aunt came and visited us in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I knew her name, but her maiden name. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Then we parted company. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">He took that information back to his father in a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">The young man's name was Oppenheimer. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It was a clothing empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">They were filthy rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">He turned that information over to one of his minions and they found this aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> rather nearby and another aunt, and an uncle and untold cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">So, they now had word that I was alive, and they went -- they didn't know where I was so they went to the American Red Cross and asked to find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Well, after this drinking episode I heard that the U.N. Relief and Rehabilitation Administration could use volunteers, so I went to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I was interviewed by a young man who was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he put me on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  Where was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  This was outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">The <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was in part of the old I.G. Farben structures. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">The same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they used to make cyanide gas for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">QUESTION:  So you had made your way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So, now I worked for the U.N. I was given an uniform, a G.I. uniform with the UNRRA patch on the sleeve and I was somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">My assignment was to go through every incoming letter for the Central Tracing Bureau which supervised all the findings of missing people all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> from anywhere in the world, except from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I would identify the most promising <span class="DLF">avenue</span> to inquire about these missing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So, I came across the request from the American Red Cross for me from those people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I was the quickest case we solved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">QUESTION:  The people were writing in from everywhere about their relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">ANSWER:  Yes, from anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">About 400 letters a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">It was a incredibly hellish parade of human misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Every letter was a missing relative and it was inspiring to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">The military governments of the four powers were military. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">They were not responsive to this additional burden, especially not the Soviets who didn't do anything on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And so I took one of my famous boxes of cigars to the local postmaster and explained to him what we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">What these nondescript brown G.I. envelopes designated and word got out and I had an army of post men working for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">We were incredibly successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">We solved about 400 cases a week,
QUESTION:  How did you solve these cases? </span><span class="sentence" id="912">What was your process?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  I sent out questionnaires to where I thought was the best address to try. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">If the people still lived there they responded on the questionnaire, and I had positive I.D. I also went through our death files and saw if we had them on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">QUESTION:  Cards as far as having come from the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  From the Germans, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">It was a marvelous operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It was the most important piece of work I ever did in my life and the most satisfying. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">When <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> moved its <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> to a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arolsen</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> , I went with that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I don't know, should I go into the politics of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">ANSWER:  There was little love lost between the <span class="COUNTRY">U.K.</span> politically and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">In <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , they were able to -- they being the British administrators were able to force every American out of any important position. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">The only one left was a friend of mine named Tip Westfall who had the innocuous job of supervising three ladies in something called statistics and organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I joined him because I found that some of my found cases didn't make it out, didn't notify the people even though we had found the positive answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So, Tip, who was former professor of English, asked me to join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I turned my <span class="REGION">section</span> over to a Luxembourg fellow and I became the eyes and ears, gave him the information and he wrote to Governor Lehmann, who was then the Director General, to no avail. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Then he wrote another one to Fiorello LaGuardia, who came in after Lehmann and Butch LaGuardia came to Europe and fired that crew that committed this kind of sabotage and we found a thousand files that had not been acted on. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I think that it ties in with the British access to <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> in the last century with the British access to their <span class="REGION">territory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and was tied in with that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">The head--General Morgan--of UNRRA in Europe, who was a relative of the royal family. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">He was Eisenhower's aide-de-camp during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">He was untouchable until Butch Laguardia came on the scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">He fired him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  So you think they didn't want to help people because maybe they would get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  They wanted to impound that information, take a bite out the U.N. and turn it over to a Red Cross organization that they would control. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And it just further eroded our contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">TAPE #3
QUESTION:  You were saying that you certainly did not get cooperation from the British in terms of trying to find missing people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  Or from the Soviets for different reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">QUESTION:  Were you getting help from any other international organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  No, the international organizations got our help. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We were the central organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">We had the death records from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">We had the last available information about people, and we had access to the military governments who would accept our inquiries, and then also the German postal service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  So you fed this information to the various relief organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  We fed it back to whoever asked for the information. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">If the information came from the American Red Cross we fed it back to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">If it came from a constituent of a Senator we were particularly nice to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">It was really a international service. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">It was not directed towards specific organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">QUESTION:  Did you have contact with any of the missing persons themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">That was the real welcome feedback that kept us alive because we worked very very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">It was a 7 a.m. to 11:00 at night effort, because at 11:00 at night the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> would close. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So, it was the only meal during the day that broke me away from that effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">It was truly important to combine these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I would get letters from folks in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , and anywhere in the world, grateful that they had been reunited with their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">It was very welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I saved all those things and then lost it in a move. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">It was a very good job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  Was there any kind of special sensitivity that you had to have in terms of dealing with this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Or unsensitivity: you were dealing with flesh and blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I had lost my family and I had perhaps in that respect additional sensitivity to others, but basically it was grit your teeth and do it, but by all means--do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So, 1t was, like I said, it was the best job I ever had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">QUESTION:  Were there many of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="965">How many people were working there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  Well, I had the L section in the <span class="BUILDING">tracing bureau</span> , and we did the lion's share, about 90 percent of the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I had ten typists. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I did all the screening and I did identification work. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I didn't trust anybody to do it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I just liked the results. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">That came to a halt when I received the visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">That came in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">QUESTION:  Of '46?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">ANSWER:  Of '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I was met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> by my uncle and two aunts and this incredible gentleman from an ethnic society, a Latvian society in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who gave me a $20 bill, since I had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I had nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">That was neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I was able to spend that on the subway system and learn what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is like and get a job as a busboy in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Farm Food Restaurants</span> , near Radio City Music Hall. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">That job lasted until August. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I had signed up to get my so-called first papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">The first step in the naturalization process. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">When you do that you sign up for the draft and the draft got me and I was in Ft. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Belvoir, in basic training, that same fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  Before you were a citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And then I was shipped out to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="988">They wanted to send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potsdam</span> , because I could speak German and Russian, and I objected. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">The Soviets have a system of dual citizenship, and so they could put their hands on me and then I would sit someplace in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gulag</span> and wait for the State Department to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So, I didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potsdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I asked for a different assignment and for the reasons given I was shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to the 88th division up north in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorizia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I was in S-2, the intelligence section of the battalion. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">We took care of, among other things, the 175 German PWs who were assigned to the battalion and that was an interesting ying-yang sort of change of positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">They didn't know about my background, and I didn't enlighten them. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Unlike Stutthof, they had a club in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">They had Class-A passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">It was a different kind of a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">For Christmas they invited me to their party and in their toast they said, "Well, you know, it's a changing world. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Today it is you, tomorrow it is me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">I came back in May of '47, was discharged, and I now had a G.I. Bill, so I promptly went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , found out that I was still able to sit on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">school bench</span> and then went to work for <span class="BUILDING">Westinghouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">That was fine until July of 1950 when the Korean War broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I had by now received my citizenship and I thought it was only fair and proper that I would sign up for that war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had been good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">So, I signed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I was assigned to the Signal Corps Intelligence Agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and then the Corps of Engineers Technical Intelligence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Belvoir</span> and then I was shipped off to Berlin to do some intelligence work for the American Army, which I did until July 1953.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">QUESTION:  What was it like being back there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  Interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I didn't answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">It had its different aspects. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Basically I was a civilian while I was there or at least I appeared to be a civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I was now in a different capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">I drove a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">volkswagen</span> with German police plates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">It was a different world, and one thing that came out of the war experience was adaptability. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I adapted to this life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I am told that I did good work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">When I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to be debriefed, some Colonel jumped up and saluted me and, through me, the effort of my group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">So, I was content. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I also met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> an American girl who was there working for the Army but not in the Army, and we got married as soon as my debriefing was over and I was out of the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">That brought me to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Cincinnati</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">That was in 1953. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I went to work for G.E. and in 1955 I became a nuclear engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Anybody could be that because it wasn't taught in <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We were self taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">We worked during the day and taught ourselves at night in groups until we became good enough in our trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I did that until -- I just retired in 1994, not before my company, which by now is Raytheon, was able to send me to Europe to represent them all over Europe, mostly in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I was able to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and see the <span class="NPIP">place</span> as the guest of the Latvian government, not at the end of a bayonet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I saw the <span class="BUILDING">Rumbula burial places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">There was one part of it that was particularly impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">It was a long box about six feet by six feet by 18 feet long and from it, roughly every five seconds or four seconds came the sound of a shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Since this was the burial ground of my family, it was impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I was not successful in selling anything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Subsequently a friend of mine notified a mutual friend, my old buddy Sasha Bergmans, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> that I was alive living at this point in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">We corresponded and I managed to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> to meet with him, to meet with three other surviving members of our class of '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">We had an incredible reunion.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">ANSWER:  Senior class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">None of the others were around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And from there I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> to represent our government in the International Conference on Demilitarization of Chemical Warfare Agents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">That was an interesting exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">They're still talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">We had the reception at the <span class="BUILDING">Kremlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Not bad for a graduate of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">The entertainment was provided by a pas de deux from Tschaichovsky's Swan Lake and eventually, at which point I had no more film left in my camera, ten young ladies came out in little wraparound skirts to do a Can-Can on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roller skates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> wasn't what it used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">It was the second time I was there and I am told that it isn't anymore what it used to be either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">But enough of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I think that perhaps the second most important aspect -- one is to be caught and be incarcerated, the other is to come out and be normal, and to me that 1s perhaps the most important part in my judgment of my life: to be normal, to have human values, a sense of humor, and a dedication to human values. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">That's my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Except for my marriage to Bella.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">QUESTION:  Was becoming normal again difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I like music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Music is a language of emotions, and I can still not listen to certain compositions without becoming emotionally deeply involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">It was more pronounced in the earlier days, 1945, 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">I was a bit of a nut. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I couldn't stand the ticking of an alarm clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I knew I threw several through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , the time element. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">But aside from those idiosyncracies I think I slowly have reentered humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I have retained certain key thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I have developed into an unforgiving American patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">There is so much I have received in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , among other things, my life--how could I be otherwise? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">This society accepted me, other societies did not, and still doesn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So, yes that is one of the residuals and I have no intention of changing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Incredible dislike for genocides in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> even though they are different from the Jewish holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">What is now going on in some parts of former Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union for example without entering politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">That is a very strong dislike I wouldn't have if I weren't burdened by those memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">My memories haven't gone away as you've noticed, they're still here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Perhaps more now than before, because I think more about it, because my wife, who was also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> and married to a friend of mine subsequently, and we are now married to each other in our tenth year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">She has given back to me my ability to talk about it and reflect on it, which I didn't have before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I have a daughter, two grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">They are my monuments to teutonic inefficiency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">That is something that I will not lose, but it does stand for reentry into normality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I don't know what else I can cite.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">QUESTION:  I'm just trying to get a sense of the difficulty in really recreating your life because the life you had before was interrupted, destroyed, parts of 1t, and when you came here you had to begin again, and that must have been very, very difficult although you obviously have done it successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">ANSWER:  Well there is no alternative to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I could do that or I could go sit at a funny <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Yes there was a price to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">There are still nightmares and they become reactivated, by some strange mechanisms I don't even know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">The reentry is not total. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">You don't experience something like that totally and then to negate what has happened, it cannot be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">The death of a family doesn't act that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">So, basically there is no alternative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">It's just a matter of how normal do you become. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Do you retain what was instilled in you as a child, a love of people, or do you become nasty and overbearing and discriminating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">There are not too many things that I really dislike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I don't like stewed okra; I never developed a taste for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I don't like people who tell ethnic jokes, because you cannot hate anybody without first diminishing it him, and an ethnic joke is intended to diminish the other guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So, yes, I have my likes and dislikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">QUESTION:  What do you think drove you through all of these years? </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">What gave you the strength, what helped you get through it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">ANSWER:  I think the remaining strong influence of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I had a magnificently harmonious upbringing in spite of many ups and downs, and what they instilled in me couldn't be destroyed by a bullet and it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I still have those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I still have my love of music and my emotional dialog with them via music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">I know what it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">It wasn't religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I had parting of the ways with an ever-loving God who was an alien in that environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">It wasn't nationalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">It wasn't love of humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">A chunk of humanity did that to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">So it was really basically their influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">My parents influence and good common sense and not having any alternatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">If I had not survived I would not be here talking to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">The probability of surviving and being here is immaterial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">It's very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">But then we start from a different premise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I really don't know how to answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">There is no fundamental philosophy that provided the will to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Maybe it was just stubbornness, good old-fashioned stubbornness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">QUESTION:  Anything else you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">ANSWER:  I just want change the emphasis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I only mentioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">The desire for love of all people, the desire not to see fatal hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">We don't all love each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I hardly know you well enough to love you, besides, Bella would object, but it's a different love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">The actions of love is not fatal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But fatal hate is a different matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">The kind of thing that motivates extermination of civilians, not enemy soldiers, that is anathema. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I hate hate.</span></p>
