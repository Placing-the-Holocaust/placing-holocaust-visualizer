<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Yah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Tell us then, uh, what happened to this family when the Germans came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">When the Germans came in, my father...I mean actually we were...we had no food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was not like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You had always something in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">In Europe, everything you need, you used to go out every day in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and you used to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">When the war broke out, the water was cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There was no gas in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to cook anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some bread or the necessary things. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour pickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of <span class="DLF">streets</span> , there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , they used to produce pickles. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">A <span class="BUILDING">Polish factory</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And they call it Original, and they used to have the pickles in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> like...small <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , and large ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">As I found out, so I went with a friend of mine and somehow we got in to that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the night, even when the bombs were falling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about 5 pounds and we dragged it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and this we lived for a couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Just on pickles! </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And once in a while, we got bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But we had some rice. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So we had rice and pickles. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And this went on for...for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I mean it was...to describe a regular <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , because there was no water to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the fires go. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It just happened the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived that nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Like next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , third <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and look for something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And this kept on for 4 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">When the Germans came in, so they didn't know what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">New rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">New Regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They first thing they did, they made a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You are not allowed to walk the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But still there was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So the only thing they did was on the corner someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchens</span> , and they used to give to the people bread and salamis. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">This is the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Right when they walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I found this it out through a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">When you go over there, let's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there 1s a <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">You gonna go over there, you gonna get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I remember like now I took my older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We walked and we walked and...and still the fires were on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , but the war was ended already. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We came over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We saw a <span class="DLF">line</span> of people, and we stood in the <span class="DLF">line</span> for that bread and the salami and sometime they gave you two breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">When I got to the <span class="DLF">line</span> , a Pole...a Polish kid came out and said to the German, "He's Jude." </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You know like...the German didn't even know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the Polish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like "Don't give it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He's a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So he chased us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So when he chased us away, we stood again. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So now, the Polish kids, they chased us away and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So we had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without bread and without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> , from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ; and this is like 4 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So we took 2 pails of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Me and my sister took 2 pails of water, and we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We carried the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> so when we had to pass by a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish neighborhood</span> , those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out and make us walk back. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Every citizen was on his own, and they know they lost their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Still the hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The anti- Semitism those Polish people had toward the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">For no reason at all! </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Now they felt that they can do with the German help what they always want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And here they got somebody to point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with the water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry that far pails of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So this went on for a couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You know with that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Finally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I remember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the Nalevki. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I don't know how or why. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">This is the first ttme I heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They took out 53 people from that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , men, women, children, and they killed them instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">This is maybe 2 weeks after they walked in....1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And...and I don't now that...what happened with that soldier, how he got shot over there, and this was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish district</span> , you know, and they took out 53 people and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And since then everybody knew that something terrible is going to happen to the Jewish people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">District</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Now what happened to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> 1s that the German's find out about my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , so every day you see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in and they loaded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They cleaned out little by little everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My father and my grandfather, we grabbed some stuff and we kept it in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Not much because you couldn't grab too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And little by little, they cleaned out the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , they cleaned out the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They took away the machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Everything they loaded up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and I don't know where they had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we lived awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2 years, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And after...this was around 1941...1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">1941 or 42 it start getting very bad, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They made a <span class="DLF">wall</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I had to wear a arm band with the star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest sister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , she had a arm band, you know, with a...with a star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had always ready, uh, how you say a rucksack with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">That was my father's idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We don't know what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">First day here, they clean out this <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They clean out this <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You walk out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You don't know if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they need 100 people to go to work, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">When we lived in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , we lived near a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">One time each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had like a committee, and they were directing all the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So who'll they take? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Elderly people, they can't take. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The youngsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And from that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> by us, we had to give them 3 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , like 10 <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , used to give 30 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">When they came back, nobody recognized them. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Each one was swelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I remember that I had a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">His name was Schemick. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating, from the undernourishment those people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">What did they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They dig some kind of <span class="DLF">dam</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They were standing all day long in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> in digging the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and from this they got swelling, and they were undernourished, and this kid lived about 2 weeks after they send him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he died because he was so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And this kept on like this, and my father was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">My mother was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My sisters were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and still we went some...and...in time of the night, we had schooling, like people made a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for 3, 4 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They shouldn't forget what they learn, and we had <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We went in the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We read books. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We still think sometime sometime will get better. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">In the meanwhile, we had...there was a Polish newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Actually it was a newspaper where the German printed but in Polish language, and this was smuggled in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We heard only about the Germans winning the war and they win this and this and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The radios was not allowed to have because they took all the radios from the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They took away one night and made a decree, everybody has a radio, fall coats, good clothes, this has to be given away. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And we didn't have no news actually what happened on the other side of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And this went on like this until 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well, we need people to go Ost [NB: to the east], means for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And the hunger in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was so great, was so bad, those people were laying on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and dying, little children went around begging, and, uh, everyday you walked out in the morning, you see somebody is laying dead, covered with newspapers or with any kind of blanket they found, and you found those people used to carry the death people in little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , used to bring them down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and bury them in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">There was no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It's your pot luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">If you don't have it, you die, and that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Finally when they start bringing people out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they promised the people, if you gonna leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we'll give you 3...3 pounds of bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And if you just register, you want to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and marmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They just went and they signed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> , and get the 3 breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they pushed them into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ; and they pushed in so many people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that they actually couldn't eat that bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> even to cut the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Well, they send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> came back with the same bread because in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> they used to put in 350 to 400 people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> and you had <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You couldn't even sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">You couldn't even stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You were just pressed like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So the bread and the marmalade when the people had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , they had to undress and they had to leave everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So the same breads and the same marmalade came back for the new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And this went on constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Now the 22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there was, uh, a...a raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The SS came, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> , and I said to my mother, "What we gonna do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So she says, "You don't have to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I got a paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Your daddy works." </span><span class="sentence" id="228">My father was working as a mechanic in a...1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for the...for the...in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So he was like taking care of all the <span class="BUILDING">machineries</span> and she has a paper that her husband works for the Germans so she says, "Don't worry, I mean." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I says, "But I have to worry because I am over 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And if they see me, they will grab me." </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So she says, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You go hide." </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So I was hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she went downstairs with my 3 sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Everybody was having that...that thing on the back of the thing with a piece of bread with a...with a schmatles (ph) inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I don't know what they keep <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And that's how they went downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And this is the...the last time I saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Because the Germans even if they saw the paper, they just took the paper like this and ripped it apart and they took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">That time they took about 10,000 people to the place <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> took the people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I was laying, hidden in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the top of the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They made like a <span class="INT_SPACE">blind room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">If you wouldn't know it, you wouldn't know it's a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But it's actually was like a hideaway on the top of the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I was laying there, and I heard the Germans came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they take them out downstairs, and I was laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I didn't know what to do, what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I figured because of the paper, he's going to read the paper and he's going to say, "Oh, well, and he's going to let him stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And he tell them to go downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">In the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , there was already hundreds of people like this, and they took them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">This was around 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And this was that day on July 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And another thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">If they have, uh, a norm. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">That means they need 10,000 people every day, and if they had 8,000, they just went around on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and just grabbed everybody who comes along to make the 10,000 up. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And that's what probably happened that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They needed a couple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes from their <span class="DLF">Umshagplatz</span> where all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , so the first thing they did, ran into those <span class="DLF">court yards</span> , and they grabbed the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told him what happened and I said to him, "Well, I...1...I can't be here anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You know, like I just can't find myself a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">First of all, I says you go away in the morning to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I have to stay here by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I don't know what can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I don't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And if you don't have no papers, you don't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It's just like, uh, you don't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I don't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So I spoke... had a friend of mine...a kid I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with him, and he told me, "There is a guy who lives next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he works on the on the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">This 1s a good job, and you can stay there and at least you're going to be safe a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I told this to my father and I said to him, you know, we're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay off a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna tell you what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">That's...some day he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">My father gave him the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I took with me...I remember like now...I took with me a leather briefcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I took with me maybe 200 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">My father says, "You take this." </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So I didn't have a chance even to wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He says, "Take it with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So I went and I took this. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I remember like now the guy took us and we walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...what nobody is allowed to walk, but he had a paper from the...from the...from the German Air Force, that he's bringing some people to work for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> or something, so... And I saw these German SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They're walking around and looking at us, see somebody and here they see four people walking in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> with any kind of fear with this look in them, so one soldier came over he asks for Ausweiss, so we showed him the paper and he says, "Go ahead." </span><span class="sentence" id="283">If you walked about about maybe 20 minutes and after I saw...I was there, I saw a German in an air force uniform waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He had half a hand because he must have been shot or something, so he's got...one arm was loose and he came over and he spoke to this guy and the says to him, three guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> , you know, because a Jew was not allowed to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And here we got those things you know because we are afraid to take it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So he said to us, "We should take them off and he 1s going to stay with us, and he paid for us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> , those tickets, and we went all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="288"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph) is like <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy Airport</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , you know, like. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And I was over there...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph), I was over there 16 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">RIght. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph) from May...No...from July, August...No. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph)... went August, September, November...3 months....4 months...16 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And we didn't know what happened to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We know that there's no people left over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Everybody is out. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I didn't know what happened to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And I was there 16 weeks, and we worked by coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We unload <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> of coal for the Germans used to use for heating up the systems and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> of coals went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So this was mine job, to unload and load coals. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And once we clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> ...once in a while they took us to clean out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military airplanes</span> , little things like this, not major stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And they used to feed us, maybe 2 slices of bread a day and a soup, a watery soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But we had good <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> to sleep because in those <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> used to sleep the soldiers and this was an empty <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> so we had to sleep, we had good <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">There's no... We had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">This is very unusual and, uh, the only thing was no was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So that money that I have, a couple of hundred zlotys, this lasts me for awhile to buy myself, and over there where we used to go to work, I used to take coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I used to stuff myself in mine coat, and the coat used to weigh 20 pounds because I used to cut out the underline and used to stuff with coals. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">When I walked from the...from the <span class="DLF">air field</span> back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I used to ask the soldiers, the German air force...they weren't that bad...the air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They weren't that bad because they probably were not indoctrinated like the German SS or the Gestapo, so I used to say to him, "You see how dirty I was. (</span><span class="sentence" id="310">in German) I have to buy soap to wash my face." </span><span class="sentence" id="311">He said, "Sure." </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So they used to walk slow. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I used to run across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">There was little <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> from Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They have little <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They used to sell bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They used to sell soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They used to sell candies. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And I used to go in and I used to say in Polish to them, "You want a coal." </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Oh, they were...they went crazy, because they weren't allowed to have coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I mean the Germans took everything away. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And I used to walk like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I bend down, I scouped everything up, put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> and they gave me sometimes...they gave me a half a bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Sometimes they gave me some a piece of salami. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Sometime they gave me some candies. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Sometimes a pack of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I mean, that's all I need. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I didn't need no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I need to bargain with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I need to deal with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And this went on for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Once I heard there's people starting to run away, from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and I says, "Where do they running?" </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They found out that some people still live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I didn't know where to run...to who to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And this every night, I used to sleep and I used to think how will I get out from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Maybe my father's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Maybe my mother came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And I was a young kid at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I was a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I was 16 years old, I mean I didn't know even how to think straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But once it was winter...1t was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Was dark already when we walked back. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I heard a Pole calling my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He was standing on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And we walked to the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> like to the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , and he called my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">He says in Polish, "Is there a Lewent here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And my name in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> 1s Levent, not Lewent. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And I heard that, I says "Yes," and I started to run to him and the German thought I am going to run away, he walloped me with a rifle right in my stomach and I fell right down. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So the Pole, he saw that he said, he's going to be back tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I couldn't sleep anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I really hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">This is the first time I saw them hitting somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">He thought I am going to runaway you know because he saw me running out from the <span class="DLF">line</span> of people and after that, tomorrow, the same time, he's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">He calls me. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">That time, I was smarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I kept myself to the end, not in the middle, and to the end, and I said to him, "I am going to go buy something." </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And he went and he gave me a piece of paper...put me a end a piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And I grabbed a hold of piece of paper like this, and I went back in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I came in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I opened up the piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">My father wrote me a letter, and he says that he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">He still works in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And I shouldn't try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">He's gonna get me somebody to take me out and bring me to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And this was in December 1940...42. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I couldn't wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">After 1 day...after the second day or the third day, nobody shows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">It's a week already, nobody shows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So I says...I said to my friend, Landau, I says, "You know I am gonna...1 am gonna run away." </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He says, "Don't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They're gonna shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Don't do it, you know." </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I says, "No, I'll figure out something." </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So one night I remember like now, it was about Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">This was the 30th of December before New Years, between Christmas and New Years. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And I did the same trick. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I had coals with me, and I was dirty black, the face and the hands, you know, like anything...and I asked the same guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He was an elderly man. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And I said to him, "I'm gonna buy soap to wash myself." </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And he says, "Go ahead" "Come right back," he says.

class="sentence" id="487">He went over to the next guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He had two breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He took away one from him and he gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And this is the same guy who wouldn't even let me in next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I passed him and I went in to the other <span

me and says, "Give me back my bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">That's mine." </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So I was afraid to start making a commotion because there were Jewish police, there were German Police, there were Polish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So I gave them the bread and I said, "Thank God, I am on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Forget about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I came in to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I have to look where my father 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Now I found out I have to go through three...three...how do you say it...three posts, with the soldiers to go through these. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So I went to a friend what I know he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I asked him what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He says, "I can't give you no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There's nobody here. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Everything is bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">There's no people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">People...very few people. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He says, "You have to figure out for yourself what to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I found a way how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I saw there's people going in groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They're going in groups, like six people, they go through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> or 8 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I went to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and I said to the six people, "where are you working." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Some speak German and some don't because I learn a little bit German to speak when I was working over there at the...at that <span class="BUILDING">military airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So I make believe that I am the leader of those 8 people and I said in German, "You should all stand in one <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">You give me all the papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And I went over there to the soldier and I says to him in German, you know like big deal, I says to him, "Look, I got 8 people going to work and this is the papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He looked on the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He didn't ask me for the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It was a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He didn't ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He just saw...because they have respect for people they are...they are, let's say, leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So there he thought as I'm the leader for them, so...you don't ask a leader for papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So those 8 people went and I went with them and that's how I went over there and after I went on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my father lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And I remember like now, it's <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and I walked up, opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It was in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Here he saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He said, "What are you doing here, Ike?" </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I says, "Look, I couldn't wait until you send somebody to take me." </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So...and this is the time when I stood there and my father took me in in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He went to the boss, the German boss what owns...he was like...and he took me in and I was working over there until... I went through three, four selections over there when they took away the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I...one selection was January 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">One day... You remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">One day they called us all downstairs, came in a big deal from the SS men, the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They lined us all up. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I remember like now I had a pair of boots and I had coveralls or overalls. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I don't know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I was sitting there and he went 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">He didn't make 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Every sixth men he took out. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I was 4. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">My father was 5. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I was standing right next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The 6th one was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">After he went 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6 out, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was standing right there so they took out about maybe 60 people or 80 people, put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Didn't see them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">This was the first selection was that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And I was working in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> until the ghetto uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">It was the ghetto uprising, that's the time it started the whole problem.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">ANSWER:  Well, the march was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">We walked about 8, 6 people abreast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And let's say 50 people in a column and if there...there was...there was like a distance, maybe 3 or 4 feet, there were two SS going in the back and two SS in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And the rifles were always aimed on the people, and we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And who couldn't walk because of lacking of food or water or something happened to him...he got sick, he get shot immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">There was no mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Get up or carry you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And if they see somebody was carrying or dragging, you both get shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So somehow we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">You can hear only the clap clap from the wooden shoes, and we walked, let's say, maybe a day, maybe a day and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And I...1f you tell me where I was, I couldn't tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I... know we was...how far can we walk? </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">But you were Jjust...your mind was on blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I mean, there was no thinking anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And we walked and we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , there was standing maybe 15 or 20 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And they told us to sit down and take a rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">We sit down and we rested, and everybody was screaming water, you know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And the minute we said something, right away they take the rifles and shoot in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And in that thing there was not only SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">There was a lot of Ukrainian soldiers what they were guarding some camp or something and they wore those uniforms, and they were very mean, very mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">They pushed us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Somehow I went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I was laying against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and it was so bad because after 3 days nothing to have in your mouth.. Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And I figured that thety are going to starve us out or something, so they're trying to run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">We went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">You can see only the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">There was just wire on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And I was very delirious...delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I mean I really don't know at that time what happened, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And I was laying in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And I didn't feel even hungry any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">You know you get to the point, the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> you don't feel anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And we went in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> maybe a day...a day and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">All of a sudden I hear the German soldiers they jumping off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they going on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they stopping the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> like there's something going on, and they didn't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So one soldier, he was already an elderly man because the youngsters were away already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">The youngsters were sitting on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and the old guys, they were sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with us to guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">He says, "You know your President died." </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">That's the time when Roosevelt died. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Your President." </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">in German he said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I mean you couldn't even make it out what 1t means your president died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I mean I didn't know if the president was a Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I didn't know those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">But the way he said it, "Your President died." </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Now..and this was like in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I remember like it's getting dark, so we trying to ask the soldier, "Where are we going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">He says he doesn't know...he doesn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And he was sitting and eating, cutting the bread and eating, and here were people sitting and starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And the night the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">All the soldiers go down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">After they come back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , there's something going on they didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Next day in the morning, we saw all the soldiers with no insignia anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">No insignia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Everybody you noticed that is the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">There was no officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">There was no sergeants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">There was no thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Everybody had no insignias. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">The uniform had no insignias. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">We didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">We didn't understand what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Now...now we realize what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And this was April the 30th, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staltah</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">This is maybe 30 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And you imagined the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going around in circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">They didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">One probably says we shoot them, one says no, one says the Americans are coming probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">They didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That's the reason...1t's only 30, 40 miles distance and they traveled 2 days just around the clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I was sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and all of a sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was standing on the top and the bottom was the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , and we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And this was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And we saw the stars and all the soldiers...the German soldiers saw that, they start jumping from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">They dropped their rifles and they started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Well, everybody from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...barely we opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> because the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">We opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">They weren't locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">We opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Nobody could get out because it was so high to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And here you got half dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">If this will take another day, nobody will be alive in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> without food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So they start falling out like this, who got hurt, and they started rolling down to the <span class="DLF">ravine</span> , all the way down to the bottom where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So I said to a guy, "Push me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So he pushed me out and the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Just keep rolling like this until the end and I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And here the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I just remember like now, a guy came over from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">He came over to me and he says to me...I don't know if he spoke German or half English...if I am alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I says yes, and I says wasser_, wasser_, means water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">He took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">field tank</span> and he gave me some water and he says, "I ama Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I says, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">He says, "I am a Jew too." </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And he says...and he took off a mezuzah he had and he put it on me, and he says (sobbing) "You're gonna live," he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">He took out a chocolate and he gave me and he says in Yiddish, '"___ I have a job to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Iam busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">The war is still on, and I can't take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">He says, "I leave you here and somebody will come after (sobbing) and take you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I was laying there on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> maybe 2 hours and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> passed by and soldiers and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> and they didn't care about the people because they're going to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And maybe 2, 3 hours later, probably the...those people they clean up, you know...they reserved for this...or the medical corps, and they saw what happened (sobbing) What a sight! </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">What a sight! </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">You see thousands, hundreds of people laying half dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">A young man had that body they moved, and I remember I was laying there on this guy says and he said, "Oh my God, what a sight!" (</span><span class="sentence" id="1134">sobbing) They start picking up the people (sobbing). </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">The picked them up one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Most of them were dead because they could... And the water...and those that were alive they put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> , and they took them to <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> or they made <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and they put them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">They gave them water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">They gave them packets from the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And this was bad too because people when they got those packages, there was powdered milk, there was chocolate; there was a can of meat, and they were so hungry, they didn't care and they ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">So hundreds died from eating this stuff, because their stomach was no used to food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And I had a guy next to me...I don't know if he was a doctor once or something...he was half dead too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">When he got that package...and I think he was Hungarian or Rumanian...he says to me, "Don't eat nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Don't eat nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">If you gonna eat anything, you gonna die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">The only thing you do, if you have sugar, take the sugar in the mouth and suck on the sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">That's that the only thing you should do, he says, the rest of them throw away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And if you want to keep it, keep it, but don't eat anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Don't take the milk in your mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Don't take the chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Don't take the meat because they used to give you a can of meat, Spam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Don't eat it, because if you're gonna eat it, you're gonna die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Those people, they eat the stuff, they got diahrrea and they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">So what I do and I had that sugar, Domino sugar, the little tiny pieces, and I used to suck on that sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I was so hungry I could eat an elephant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">But he said to me, "You're gonna die if you're gonna eat it," this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Well, this guy died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Yah, he died next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">He died not from eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">He died because he Jjust...just his heart stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">He just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And this guy saved me because he said, "Don't eat anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Just suck on the sugar." </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And for 2 days I laid there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">They didn't give us no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">They used to give us cereal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">A bowl of cereal everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">That's the only food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And they used to say to the people, "Don't eat this stuff because..." People didn't listen because they were so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And after a while, they gave us start giving us a piece of bread and like a little baby, they nudge us back to normality, like a little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Here you see people after they gave us a little piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">The next day they give us a little piece of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">You know...cereal soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">No soup with meat and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And little by little, you know, you get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And I was in that <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> maybe a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And after...and they didn't give us clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">No clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I still was laying in the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">The only thing I have is a Army blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">You know those green blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">After this, and this was, let's say about near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> someplace, and after the sanitar corps went away there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">There is nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Because the war is still on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">It was not the 8th of May yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">That was the 2nd of May, the 3rd of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">But they were nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">You know they still say to us...a lot of Jews was there and they still say, "There's the front and we have to leave you and the only thing what was in those <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> was two men and they were taking care of those <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And left us <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , and the German from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had to come every day and clean those <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> out and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And after the German had to come and dig a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> and they buried all the dead people that was laying around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">It was a sight! </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">It was a sight because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was on top, and the bottom was the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , and the people used to go from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> like this, falling down and you see all hanging on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> , near a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , and you see men and women, and small men, and large men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Everybody was laying spread over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">They were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">They were just couldn't...they just couldn't hold it on anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">The minute the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> opened up, you see all falling out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">They were half...every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> had half dead people <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Like I told you, only young people could have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Only the youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And after this, me and one more guy went over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">We took our little strength and we says, "We're gonna walk to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And we walked in that uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">We felt more strength, and I remember like now we came to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a German woman inside, and she saw us and she started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">She run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">She saw both of us and we wore striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">We walked in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">What a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">All kind of china, with <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> with clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">First thing I did I took off my things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I took out a shirt, and I put on a shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">This is the first time in 3, 4 years I had a shirt on my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Shoes I couldn't find, but I found a pair of rubber shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">I put on the rubber shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And a pair of pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And after I saw her looking and I hollered to her, "Come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">You know what I need some food, you know, to eat." </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">So she gave us some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">But I saw her looking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">She looked...she looked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I don't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And what do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">In the <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span> , there was a little girl, maybe 4 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">She was...she hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I went to her and I says, "Do you think I am going to harm you little girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Do you think I am going to be just like you people were? </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I am not going to harm you, little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">You don't have to hide on the <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">She didn't say a word, you know, when I said this to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">But this little girl was laying in that <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span> hidden because she thought that...because this what they did to us, we're gonna to do to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And the same thing is when the Germans threw away those rifles by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I couldn't have picked up a rifle and killed all I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I couldn't even move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I couldn't even pick that rifle up from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Probably maybe if I could, I would have feel maybe I would do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I couldn't even do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I couldn't even lift up the rifle that was laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> because first of all they are very heavy and second of all, I am not the type to kill anybody or to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">First, in...1n...especially when the war was going on, you could have walked around in every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and do anything you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Nobody did
