QUESTION:  And why did —
ANSWER:  — while he was — actually my father was not taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , because he had had a broken leg the summer before. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So he took his two canes with him, and because of that they kept him in the <span class="BUILDING">town jail</span> with all the older people, for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And after that they — my grandmother was very active in the community and she got him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Also her — my grandfather, and their son, were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But my grandmother, as I said, was very active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> and she actually wa — this I — this I was told, went to the Nazis, to the — to the police, and said, several of our men died, we need 10 min — 10 people to have a minyan. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So this — March 2, 2010 and my grandfather, I think was, came back, and my father was let out, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They were — they did let people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I don’t think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> was — there were N- Nazis, but I don’t think it was like in some of the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , that they were so awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Now, I do have a picture here that shows my father in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , being marched through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">You know, they took all the men that day and marched them through the main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It was called Maximilianstrasse, I remember that, before they took — sent them off to either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or the — or the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I have a picture of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  And did your father ever describe his emotions after the war —
ANSWER:  No, not really —
QUESTION:  — or discuss this photograph with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Not really, no, no, he never did, uh-uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Only thing I remember, when he was let go, an-and we were co — we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — when we knew he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I remember him sitting at the — at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">family room</span> , shaving off his beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Course, he had a growth of beard for the — from the whole week, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So I remember him sitting there shaving his beard, that’s what I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  And what happened to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Well, my father was able to sell his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Now th — I think he sold it already before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My grandfather still was really plundered. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">That was plundered and all March 2, 2010 the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were smashed, and I think I once saw a little bit of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But like I said, my family, I think they shielded us, you know, from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They didn’t — they didn’t want me to see it or whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And of course, our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The <span class="BUILDING">schoolhouse</span> that we — I attended, that’s next to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , that was not burned, only the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  And did you witness the fire?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  No, no, we lived too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">No, we lived too far away, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  And right after Kristallnacht, when you tried to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> — why don’t you tell me a little bit about schooling, when you had to move to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , whether it was close —
ANSWER:  Well, I started right from a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , I never went to any other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was na — ah — ah — it was intermittent, because I think our teacher left ha — where is — it was a <span class="BUILDING">one room schoolhouse</span> , basically, all the grades together, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And a — th-they were — there was intermittent because the teacher that finally came to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> came from the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> , and he had to come on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was late, he was late, so, you know, schooling was intermittent. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So, actually I — I don’t remember too much about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I mean, it was basically I guess from — we were suppose — well, we were supposed to leave in — in August of ’39, or September of ’39, and just when the war — we had packed March 2, 2010 everything up, after my parents had made special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , small for here, because they knew the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> here were much smaller, and we moved in with my grandparents and then the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And it was — we were supposed to go by way of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Okay, before — I want to talk about emigration, but let me ask one other question with this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; did they shut the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> down after Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  No, not really, that I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  So you were able the next day to just come back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember it was — it was the next day or it was a few weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I really don’t have any recollection of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Okay, let’s talk about emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Do you remember listening to your parent talk about wanting to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and what those discussions entailed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I mean —
QUESTION:  When they first wanted to leave [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  — oh, well, I mean, we knew we were getting ready to leave, and that — like I said, my parents, you know, had special furniture made that would be smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="146"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Beds</span> that would go up into the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , you know, things like that, because they knew here it would be a smaller <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we would be able to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">March 2, 2010
QUESTION:  And do they have any trouble getting emigration visas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  No, my father had a brother here, who had been here since 1926, I think, and through him we had the affidavits. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we had numbers to go to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And we did go there, you know, we had to have clearance as far as health was concerned and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So I remember going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> where the — where the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> was, and you know, being checked out and we — everything was okay, and we had the visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Before nine — before September ’39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  And then — describe what — you were saying that you were supposed to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the war broke out, so —
ANSWER:  Well, yeah, I mean, that — that — then the whole thing got scrapped because we couldn’t leave, we a-are — we had already packed all our things, so we moved in with my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And the — the correspondence that I found after — actually my father’s death many, many years later, was regarding — the Americans evidently gave us a hard time because there were four of us, and my father’s brother here wasn’t making enough money, although he worked for relatives here, and the — the ones — was very reluctant to put his name down that he would support us in case he di — we needed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, I think they finally persuaded him, si — but we never took a penny from him, but just to put his name on the — on — you know, this — <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was in a depression at that time, so my uncle had a hard time convincing them that March 2, 2010 even if we came here, he — we would not be a burden to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So, you know, that — that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">You know, tha-that correspondence I read mon — many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My father didn’t die until 1984. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But I found all that in correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And it was even discussion about sending me to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> because my father had relatives there, you know, so I found all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Let’s come back, so September °39, you’re packed and it falls through. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Describe those events, so —
ANSWER:  Well, you know, I was — how old — was °38, I was nine years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
