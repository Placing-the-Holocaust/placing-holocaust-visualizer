ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And when were you born and where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> on February 24, 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family, how long they had been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  No, how long they had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> from ’22 to ’27, because my father was working -- he was an engineer, electrical engineer, and he was working with the <span class="DLF">shipyards</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monfalcone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And when it were -- he was transfers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> , which now 1s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijeka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> when I was about five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> until 1945, until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And Father worked there, he was a chief -- he was the director of the electrical department of the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Can-Cantieri Navale del Quarnaro, where they were building all kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , even to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yacht</span> for Mussolini they built, which was never delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And he was in charge of -- not only of the projects for the electrical equipment on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , but also of the -- care of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cranes</span> and all the electrical equipment of the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And practically I was born with fascism, grew under January 20, 2004 fascism, without realizing -- it wa -- it w -- 1t was normal for -- for s -- my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Then they came when -- when we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Of course, we were all supposed to be piccolo Italiani, small, little Italians, because otherwise the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> -- apparently we were not able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I never realized that, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I went through the whole system until I finished the -- what we call <span class="BUILDING">senior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Actually it is the Liceo Scientifico, Scientific Lyceum, which is practically comparable to the -- to here -- even though it was only four year. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Four year of <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> and four years of senior high. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> I went to the <span class="BUILDING">technical institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">The <span class="BUILDING">senior high</span> I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Liceo Scientifico</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But as far as education, they told me it’s comparable, when you finish Liceo Scientific -- Scientifico, excuse me, like two years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because we had very thorough, you know, the education in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My father continued to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">H-He was never a -- a -- a carda -- a card holding fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He became -- he had to become or -- or -- a member of the fascist party in 1942, because otherwise he would have lost his job and h-he had responsibilities [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He had trouble because he didn’t want to wear the uniform, and he never had a uniform and he never wore the black tie -- the -- the black shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But you know, they were, with the exceptions of few fanat -- a few -- several fanatics, the population was a strange population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> because they were open-minded on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and fascist on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> because after the first World War, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> was next to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> only in 1924, after the famous DiNunzio coup. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Apparently th-the Italians didn’t January 20, 2004 want them, but they felt and they are still feel f -- extremely Italian, even though the population was mixed and the ch -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was occupied by everybody, from the Espaniards to the st -- Napoleon, th-the Venetians. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It started as an Roman colony and -- but they were always, who knows why, very deeply, they felt deeply Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And so that’s why they accepted DiNunzio. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So DiNunzio and Mussolini, even though they didn’t like each other very, very much, I must say -- for awhile they did, but then -- you see, they connected their fact that they were -- that they could join the Italian, they were admitted to be Italians betwe -- to DiNunzio and to Mussolini. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So they felt in that fak -- ka -- in that sense they felt that they were fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Fascists because th -- fascism permitted them to be Italians, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was [indecipherable] after. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I tell you also another thing, that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which was extremely wealthy, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we ended up with 45,000 people, but we were much smaller when I was little, had many plans, many industries. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It had the torpedo plant, it had th-the <span class="DLF">shipyards</span> , it had the <span class="BUILDING">oil refinery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It had <span class="BUILDING">heavy machinery plant</span> , it had <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> , and it -- ab-absolutely everything, and the population, the workers were very well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They had nice <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , we were going skiing together at the engineers -- th-th-th-the director, with the son of th-the -- th-th-th- th-the -- of -- of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We were really a str -- strong community. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We were playing tennis together with the children of the workers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So much so that we had a limited number of poor, who were known all by name, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And there was a very important Jewish community, Ashkenazi, coming from the east, from the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> , from January 20, 2004 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">| don’t think there was a single Sephardic Jew, as far as I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And we had in <span class="BUILDING">Villa Firenze</span> where we lived, among the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , just across of it, a beautiful, beautiful, three domed synagogue with the cupolas covered with copper tiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It was really beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And living across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from them, you see -- we were always saying, oh, d -- you know, they were th-the -- the real Orthodox Jews, the one with the curls and the -- and the fur k -- and the hats with the fur around it, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we were s -- and -- and they were telling us, you know -- we were children, we were -- we were actually not so much children al-already, they were saying, oh well we cou -- we cannot go in there, we cannot go in there, because you know, we -- they don’t allow us to go there and who knows what’s going on there? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But I never heard about -- people talking about blood sacrifices or things like this because they were -- we were so interwined that even then there were not many, but there were several mixed marriages at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And in my case, for instance, I found -- I found out that some of my schoolmates in -- in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were Jewish because they were allowed, on the Sabbath -- because at the time we were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> also on s -- on Saturday -- on the Sabbath they were not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but they were justified. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They were allowed not to come, because until the racial laws were applied, unfortunately, there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And -- and -- and -- and we were going -- Jewish kids and non-Jewish kids and Protestant kids, we were all together, we couldn’t care less about religion, o-or wherever they were coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So, what did I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I remember, of all these other people, there was a -- a v -- a very January 20, 2004 interesting man, a -- a Jew, Mr. Tannenbaum, ma -- mister -- well fa -- probably Mr. Tannenbaum, for us he’s -- it looked like -- like a -- like a priest or something, because [indecipherable] we know, with the black caftan and the hat with the fur around. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He was the sweetest man in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My father knew him well. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He didn’t come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> often, but he was going around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of people he knew, he was friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He was collecting money for charities. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But charities not for the Jewish population, for everybody who was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He was well known for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Then, of course, he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Life was very comfortable in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> , very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Every year we were going to a [speaks Italian here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And th-there I met a-another group of -- I had this group of Jewish friends tha -- the Lagers, Bondy and Kathy Lager, his bra -- his cousin, and we were all having fun going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> together [indecipherable] this or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I remember they were already on guard in the sense that while we kind of ignored the musics from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , jazz, the [indecipherable] they already heard, may-maybe because they had relatives here or something, I don’t know for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But anyhow, they were bringing this music and we learned jazz through these Jewish friends of ours, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They were really fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I remember that Bondy Lager was very much in love with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">An-And I met Bondy when I first came here in ’55, and he was married to an Austrian girl -- Jewish girl, and he had a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we met in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where he had a plant or -- or -- or a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- 0-of t-toys for -- and it -- 1t was very emotional, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">After so many years, you know I call, who’s there? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He says, B-Bondy’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Also because when January 20, 2004 Bondy escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> in -- just as -- with the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> which left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naple</span> , it must have been 1940, his parents remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They were merchants and they had a deposit with they had all kind of food, the potatoes, all kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Th-The parents remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> , but Bondy and his sister came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And they left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And when they left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> , my sister and myself went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to say goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And the funny thing 1s that since at that time I was young and I had many boys at the same time growing around me, my sister was saying, you know, yi- there 1s like a -- like a-a -- a torta, a -- a cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">All the flies go to hel -- you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So that when Bondy was writing to me, he was saying lot of love to the torta, you know [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Well, that was the story of Bondy. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">His -- his cousin went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , h- he’s -- hid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , the -- Lazi, because they were of Hungarian descent, that Lazi -- Ladizlow, and -- and he was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Then what happened with this? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The anschluss, yes, there’s -- now we come to the real s -- thing, which is important.</span></p>

class="sentence" id="267">And so apparently he gave them -- yeah, and he gave them papers with another name, Sardi, and th-the Franciscans father of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> of sa -- of San Geron -- Geronim -- Geronimo’s <span class="BUILDING">church</span> gave them birth certificates, Catholic [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But they fact is that 1-1n -- in the -- between ’38 to ’43, Tondo became a big boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They were -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> , everybody knew them because they were so

they wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> , but how do we go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Everybody knows us, somebody meet you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and if we have different documents, the Germans were going up and down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Okay, we -- Thea can take the -- the -- the documents for you, but -- but you le -- so they left with the f-forged documents on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , like an idiot, I was on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> as they were o-on with their real documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So -- but we pretended not to know each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I was sitting in one -- I -- I was sitting on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , in one <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , they were sitting on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And then, you know, we were in different are -- Tondo and I went on the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> , we started to talk like two people who just meet, you know, it wa -- it was really January 20, 2004 something. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They were no trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">In the meantime we had told to my sist -- my aunt -- my mother’s sister, who was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> , that they were coming, to please -- she s -- since she had the large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , not many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , but a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , an enormous <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , larger than this one, to arrange for them to spend the night there, because the next day they were going to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So when they arrived, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my aunt, she had arranged some mats on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> an-and we slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And the next day they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Their new names were Sardi. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They were no more Schtitzel, they were Sardi, and they went to live for awhile in <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But, of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> are pretty close and they were afraid that some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> would recognize them there, or [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I remember that even I went once to visit with them -- o-or es -- yes, before leaving they gave us their jewelry, and there was another family too, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abbazia</span> , where they left a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> , where she left her fur coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I don’t know what was there because we never saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> and we never saw that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And I don’t know if -- how the stuff she gave them left. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We -- they left in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> only some wine, some food that he had put aside, Mr. Schtitzel. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But they gave us the jewelry, and she took only a beautiful diamond ring she had, she took with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And they went to -- as I say, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I went to visit with them and by mistake I knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I said, Mr. Schtitzel. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The poor man was scared -- was scared to death, but I did -- you know, it win -- I-I -- without thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He was so scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Anyhow, from there they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> where this engineer, Fierst, who was th -- January 20, 2004 working my -- with my father had found refuge in a -- in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , where many Jews were living we -- under ma -- different names, and they moved in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The portieri knew about them, everybody knew who they were, but nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But the fact 1s that -- came that time that Tondo had the age to be called into the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And th -- Mr. Schtitzel, Arnold, got so scared that he -- I don’t know through whom, thi-this we heard later wa -- from -- from the sh -- from the Fierst who told them, don’t do that, don’t do that, they might not call him. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Hide the boy, don’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Instead, no, no, no, no, we go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And the guys who were supposed to take them across the <span class="DLF">border</span> apparently betrayed them, and -- and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">For a long time we didn’t hear anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">The war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Tito occupied our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And one day a nice gentleman knocks at our <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And he says, I am so and so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I am the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I know that you helped the -- the

course he -- he demonstrated [indecipherable] and we gave the jewels to him a-and then we didn’t hear from him any more, but I’m -- it -- I’m sure -- how -- how else could he know if -- if they had not told him? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We trusted him immediately and we gave him back the jewels. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">She had -- she had hidden her diamond in her <span class="INT_SPACE">rectum</span> when she was traveling and of course they found it, you know, because there -- they were examining a-absolutely everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And so -- and January 20, 2004 this man told us that Tondo and her -- and the father died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and, which 1s even more terrible, Nellie, the mother, was sick and she was killed by the dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  They were chasing after her and they -- and she died like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">In the meantime, they had left with us the address of

also, telling him about the jewels and telling him about the few things that they left with us, a -- a -- a silver box, because Mr. Schtitzel, during the first World Wars, was a officer in the Austrian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And the box he left with us was a box that he received from his companions, I don’t know in what occasion, with all the signatures of his

wrote to Uncle Otto in English, with my poor English, but I managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">No, I -- Ia -- at the time I was speaking some German, I don’t know whether it was German or

id="322">And -- and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And that was the end o-o-of the <span class="BUILDING">Schtitzel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And to us it was just like losing family, and- and to hear that they went like that was really terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I kept corresponding with Uncle Otto, who was sending us care packages, because under Tito it was much worse than during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">That was the worst part of -- for us, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> was bombed only by January 20, 2004- by the -- but when the British were bombing, where they were coming only with the s - small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , with the Sp-Spitfires, you know, and they were -- since all the -- th-the -- the big industries were along the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , they were not touching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span

behind th -- we are on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and -- th- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and the <span

occupied the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> , part of the he -- lighter works were hidden under the rocks under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and so that -- and also, near our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there was a shelter under th-the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> , so that we were safe in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And during that time, they were recruiting the Germ -- the Germans -- this 1s -- this has nothing to -- the Schtitzel were already away, but at that time, yes, we were still -- there were still Jews, men -- several

</span><span class="sentence" id="334">And the ta -- the time came that -- when th-the -- the Germans started to recruit the young people to work -- the famous [indecipherable] organization, you know, to build a -- fortresses to -- to -- to build for them things all along the <span class="DLF">border</span> because we were right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> with the Yugoslavs, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And we were saying, Paolo and Rudy, Paolo, go away, go away, go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Why do you stay here, why do you stay here? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">January 20, 2004 And they said no, but there is no, we are working there, they are kind to us, they are nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We are not only Jews there, they were recruiting everybody, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And he said, no, no, he said, we stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Then one day they took

class="sentence" id="346">No, no, no, no, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">In the meantime also, my sister and myself were recruited and my sister became a welder. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Be si -- since Father was working at the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> , he immediately put them to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I was studying to

id="350">And my sister was a welder for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And -- and the funny thing 1s that they were repairing the -- one of the -- I think 1t was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruiser</span> , I don’t rem -- I don’t know the name, the American names of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , but anyhow, which had been damaged, and the work was not -- never proceeding because the workers were working and undoing. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Doing and undoing so that the Germans couldn’t get it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But finally they had to do it, and they -- because the Germans started to -- so, it was completed, and they went [indecipherable] to test, they were only -- but they were only the workers, Italian, that January 20, 2004 they f -- workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">My father was on board, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They went to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , they tested, they came back, everything was perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The first time that the Germans went at <span

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , because working there both of us, we were there at the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> with Father. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">All at once from -- 1t was a <span class="DLF">sky</span> like this one with broken clouds and sun, out of the clouds, Spitsfires started to comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They knew that there were only

class="sentence" id="360">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Then they bombed of course the -- the -- the -- the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> , the Americans who were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We were able to go underground, in -- under the -- th-the rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Then, when the bombardment was over, they brought some

</span><span class="sentence" id="366">I gave him morphium and then they took him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I heard that day he lost a leg, this soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And so the Farcas brothers were still there and one morning, it was a Sunday, we wake up and we could see the <span

id="376">We were there crying, crying, crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">You should have seen that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , it was so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And -- but we se -- an-and they didn’t let the firemen to go and take care of the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">It was a terrible day. </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Well, the -- as I said, I was working as a nurse in the <span class="DLF">shipyards</span> , and my sister was a welder, but for -- at the time she stopped working as a welder because she had typhoid fever, something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">She was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And when the end was coming, it was the beginning of May, the Yugoslav were bombing with ca -- with ca-cannons, grenades, Fiume. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And in order to be safer, they had -- they -- the engineers had the -- the shifts to spend the nights in the <span class="BUILDING">shipyard</span> , to keep an eye on whatever was going on, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And | as a nurse, was staying with Father and we were sleeping underground in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shelter</span> , under the rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It was a very safe shelter, I must say because when they bombed, nothing happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They destroyed a lot of things, but the bomb didn’t bother us. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And, in parentheses, my fat -- my father was made th-the head of -- chief of the oompah, which I don’t remember right now what it means, but it was a -- a -- a group which was taking care of -- in case of a fire -- so-some -- some kind of a fireman, in case of bombings and things of this kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And he and his workers -- how -- how can I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The Germans had put dynamite under all the cranes of the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> , because before leaving they wanted to destroy the <span class="DLF">shipyards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Father and his men of the oompah, I don’t know January 20, 2004 when, I don’t know now because he didn’t -- they didn’t talk about these things, took off th -- everything, so that nothing blew up, you know, never s -- never tol -- never recognized because it was an a -- again, a natural thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So th -- he saved the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Never recognized, never got a penny for it, but who wanted it anyhow? </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So anyhow, when they started to bomb th-th-the -- the bombs started to come from the <span class="REGION">Yugoslav side</span> and the Yugoslavs were advancing, the partisans and so on, the Germans started to flee. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And it was a heavy bombardment. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So we fa -- they said -- Father called the di-director, he said -- th-the -- of the -- of the <span class="DLF">shipyard</span> , what do I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">He said, here I have a few men, and do I -- he said, do what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Washed their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">You -- you -- you decide, you do what you want, he said, because I cannot leave here, nobody want -- you can leave because anyhow that is -- so -- so we -- we left and we went walking and it was quite the walk, you just -- like going from here, more than down, going to -- from here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span> , something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And we -- we heard the grenades, fssh, pssh, falling around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And I kept the white cas -- boar -- rope, you know, was a [indecipherable] on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But do you think that the Germans bothered t-to bother us?
