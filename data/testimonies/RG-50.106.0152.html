QUESTION:  And when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakéw</span> on December 12", 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Were you known by any other names during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Yes, I had to assume a name, a Catholic name by the name of Halina Litinska.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And how old were you at the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">June 3, 2002
QUESTION:  What can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were no longer under Nazi control?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  That day was a very difficult day in our lives because my mother, who was working for the German army, got up in the morning and thought -- it was very quiet out there, we were -- we knew that the -- the Russians were coming closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We didn’t know where they were and the quiet was just eerie. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And she didn’t know whether to go to -- to her job or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And we were standing talking about it and suddenly a hand grenade split over the -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which I didn’t know at the time, and I s -- hit my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I didn’t know what happened, I started screaming like Mother, Mother, my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And she realized that I was wounded, and everything went black, we didn’t know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> sort of was coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And she grabbed my sister, who was only a few years old, and took her in the arms and grabbed me by the hand and we got out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And my hand was bleeding and there was not a soul in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She tried to get somebody to pick us up, but nobody would. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I just had to hold her hand and we walked to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , which was at the end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">At that time somebody came out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , picked me up and dragged me off -- took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And -- where they examined my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My thumb was cut off, was hanging on a piece of skin, and my little finger was ha -- half cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My inside of the hand was a complete mess, it was June 3, 2002 just completely open. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And they -- there was no penicillin, so they had to sort of clean it as best as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">They told my mother my ha -- my arm might have to be cut off because of the infection that they expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And they just put us all up in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So that was my day of liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  When was this? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Do you happen to know the date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  I don’t know, but it was spring or summer because we -- it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We walked on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and I remember the sun was shining.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Was this 1945?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  I believe it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  And where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaroslaw</span> , which is not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , which is not our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , but where we went as Catholics because nobody knew us there and it was sort of on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I guess my mother was trying to be close, but not too close, in case she needed to look up somebody, or -- I don’t know why, really, but that’s where we -- we spent the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Can you tell me the names of your mother and your sister and how old your sister was? </span><span class="sentence" id="36">June 3, 2002
ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Olga. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My sister’s name was Eva, which she kept even as a Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And she was born in June 30, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So she must have been like almost six years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Who were your liberators?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Well, they had to have been Russian, which my mother referred to as not liberators, but occupiers, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But at least they weren't killing us any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Although there was a pogrom she told me, and she refused to let me speak my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I still had to use the Catholic name because she said they’re going to kill us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Did you see any other Jewish survivors at the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Not at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Not -- not til much later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  What did being free of the Germans mean to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Well, it meant a great frustration because I wanted to say who I was and I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And there I was with my hand in a -- on the -- on the <span class="DLF">railing</span> for two months, and my mother in the meantime -- well, they had to put it on a <span class="DLF">rail</span> because they -- the hand was -- was going to grow in such a way that I wouldn’t be able to straighten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It -- it -- it bent like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">If you -- if -- the nuns really saved my hand, because they kept on stretching and stretching. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And my mother, in the meantime, was diagnosed with cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And so -- they didn’t -- they weren’t even sure a hundred percent if it was cancer, but there was a lump. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And they felt that, you June 3, 2002 know, they didn’t want us to be orphans, they said, and they told me to go and convince her to have the -- the breast off. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So on top of everything else, she had to have her breast off and she had this operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And we discovered that the lady with whom we had been living during the war was killed by the same hand grenade that - that hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So we had no -- no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, although the neighbor next door took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So my mother spent th-the -- sort of the d-days before she got the operation between the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and with my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And then after she was operated on, she was also in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I guess my sister was with the lady sometime and sometimes with us in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Were you a witness to any acts of retaliation or retribution against people who had helped the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Not personally, but when we already lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , we had a couple living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we used to rent out hou -- <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And one of the guys was all broken up and beaten up and my father said that it was because he was a collaborator, that he - he got beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But not of my own eyes or experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Did you yourself, even though you were a child, want revenge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  I don’t know what I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I was too miserable and too weak to think about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My hand was occupying my -- my thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Re-Reuniting with my father after so many years and not knowing him and not knowing, you know, how to June 3, 2002 behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was a strange world all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I really didn’t think about it, I remember Mother saying that no matter what they will -- what kind of sentences they’ll give the Germans is not enough and there is just no kind of punishment that could punish them for what they’ve done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  You mentioned a reunion with your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Did that come immediately after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">After the war we knew he was alive because my mother got a Red Cross telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">That is, she didn't get it directly, the people who never survived to tell us anything about what went on, but were killed by the Germans, sent us a letter that there was a communication from my father through the Red Cross that he was alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So we knew he was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We had no idea where exactly he was, but after the war there were announcements all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and my mother put announcements in the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And they found him in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And that’s why he contacted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He sent my cousin, his nephew who was in the British army in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to get us out and to put us in touch with the Jewish agency, and that’s how we reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We reunited with him somewhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , after we crossed the <span class="DLF">Brenner Pass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He came to get us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Do you know when that was? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">June 3, 2002
ANSWER:  I’m not sure, but 1t was somewhere -- probably before April 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Probably March. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">March, April ’46 because by April I was 1n the -- in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and I know he didn’t stay very long because he had to report back to the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  What was he doing in the army”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Well, he was part of the General Anders, the Polish army that fought along with the British army against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And apparently Stalin made this agreement at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yalta</span> that they would let out the prisoners, all the prisoners out. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">However, he tells us that he had to run away and -- and found -- find a way to get out with the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Did you make any attempts to find other relatives or friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">My mother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakéw</span> and found that there was no sign of our grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We did find that my uncle, my father’s brother survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And we kept missing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We kept trying to find him and we didn’t know where he was exactly, but we knew he was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He lost his wife and daughter, who was exactly my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And he was the only one that survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The others -- whoever -- whoever else was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> did not survive, in my family, but my aunt, uncle and cousin who were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , June 3, 2002 also survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My uncle died in [indecipherable] on the way out already of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but my aunt and cousin lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with us afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Did you go back to your pre-war home?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  I could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> -- it’s -- it’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> now, it’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaleszezyki</span> , which is on the frontier of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">At the time, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Now it’s <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and they tell me it’s much too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They still would like to kill us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  When did you realize the full extent of the genocide? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">When did -- you know, it -- when did it all come together for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Strangely enough it came to me when I was watching “World at War” with Lawrence Olivier. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I had never really thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I guess I was too young and too concentrated on my own problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But when I saw that program, it struck me and it really hit me very, very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  I think I was already -- I don’t know, it has to be in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or maybe even in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It was a -- much, much later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  After your liberation, when you st-started moving to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , did you have much contact with other survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Personally, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My mother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and tried to track, as I said, everybody down. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There was no room for us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , so she found a -- a small June 3, 2002 place to live in, very close to one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Again they asked her directly if she was Polish, meaning was she Jewish and she had to say she was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So again we were under the assumed names, and again we had to cover up. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was very strange, I was the only one who could read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And my mother went to the Jewish agency, and strangely enough, I don’t know why it is, but she only registered herself as being alive, never put the children down. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They were very surprised that she had two children, that she managed to survive with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I never went to the Jewish com -- agency, as far as I remember, I think she went by herself, but I may have forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Very -- something very strange happened there because an old friend of hers who was remarried to a Catholic man and had big cross on her breast, said to her that my hand happened because I became a Catholic without being baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I’ve never -- never forgotten that, my mother was absolutely infuriated and sort of stuck in my mind that some of us were not perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  How long was it before you were able to -- to freely admit that you were really Jewish, and use your own name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Well, it was when we manage -- when we finally got into the Jewish agency groups and everybody was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">However, there was another little wrinkle. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They thought we were not Jewish and they tried to say that my mother was trying to get June 3, 2002 out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> under the guise of being Jewish and that she really wasn't, and we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So she had to try to convince them that she really was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And there we were, you know, trying to convince them we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And finally -- all she would say was that my -- her husband’s name was Isaac. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And finally some people who knew us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> did sign that -- sign off on us, that we were legitimate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  You said you were with the Jewish agency groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Where were you exactly? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Can you clarify that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yes, we were in sort of <span class="BUILDING">group homes</span> , they -- they had us in groups and they were going to transport us out one -- one group at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was somewhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , I -- I don’t know, 1s closer to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And what happens was - was that they took one group after a time, they took pregnant and old -- elderly people first. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The Russians had a sort of agreement that they would let us through, but they liked to be paid on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so they always had prepared money and there was a Polish guy, then a Russian guy, then they kind of closed their eyes to us, but -- but you had to still pay your way through. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> that went out got caught, and apparently they were put back into some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then they were let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They didn’t really want to keep us, but the second one went through and the problem was that before we got onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , they attacked us at night, the Polish militia. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And they wanted t-to -- to probably rape an-and steal from us, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">June 3, 2002 We had to stand there and scream on top of our lungs in order for them to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We were lucky that they in -- in the end they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">In the morning they turned up and said, oh, what was the problem, we heard there were noises. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But we knew exactly what it was, so we were just looking forward to getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It was a very strange, very strange time. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Strange time. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The last -- the -- when we ca -- got out, we- they put us out wha -- three kilometers past the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Once my mother gave up her watch because the Russians wanted watches in addition to whatever they got. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And then another guy gave his watch up. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So we got through and then the German refused to sell us tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We were supposed to buy tickets in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> on our own accord. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And the leaders went to buy tickets and the Germans didn’t want to sell them to us because we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I don’t know what they did in the end, but we did get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we did get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We were in the <span class="REGION">Russian sector</span> first and they tried to also establish that we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They took two or three people and had them sign their name in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And the -- then they came back and it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We went from there to the <span class="REGION">British section</span> and then to the <span class="REGION">American section</span> , we were kind of carted around. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And in the end they sent us on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Do you remember the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="169">June 3, 2002
ANSWER:  Yes, it was -- there were two near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ancona</span> , there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trani</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barletta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And we did not spend much time there, but have quite nice memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I remember the music. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And well, I -- as I said, we were young and we wanted -- we were happy to be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was a -- it was a better time. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The weather was beautiful, we had food, and my father told them explicitly to keep us there as long as possible, to have us recover in the nice weather and the good food. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">My father, who was a dentist, had privilege in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there and so we used to go and have our meals at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">My mother taught us to swim there in the -- in the gorgeous <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , you know, and we had a very pleasant time. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">The food was marvelous, the -- the -- the cherries particularly, just absolutely wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And the ice cream, I’ve never tasted- maybe because it was after the war and we were so hungry, but never tasted anything like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And it was -- it was very pleasant pastime. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Unfortunately, because my father asked them to send us late -- last, they sent us first to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , because we chose -- my father and my mother decided that out of the choices, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we should go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So they sent us 1n a very cold time to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It was not -- not a very happy experience to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Stay with me for just a minute in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Can you tell me a little bit about the conditions there with respect to <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and work and education opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Can you talk a little bit about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="186">June 3, 2002
ANSWER:  We were there only two months, and we -- we were just there, I think, for sleeping, because we spent most of that time in the hos -- near the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and -- and on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We didn’t have much education, no there was no education, I mean, there was nothing going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">At the time it was not organized for that yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Very early, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  Do you know when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  I don’t, I’m afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But as I said, I found that we were there in 19 -- in -- in April 1946, so that -- that’s the date that I have because I found some document that states April ’46, we were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Did you have any trouble letting go of some of the behaviors you had to use to survive during the war, like you know, did you have any trouble with your name or with anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  I didn't have any na -- trouble with my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I do remember when we first found Father and we -- he ha -- he brought a -- a chauffeur and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> and we traveled through -- through part of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and at one point we got off and went into some <span class="NPIP">side</span> -- side -- what do they call it, the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And we found these beautiful red cherries and we picked up some and we came -- came to -- back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he almost killed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I mean, he was furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">He told us no more stealing. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We were June 3, 2002 so used to do that during the war in order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So that stands out in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">What was the other question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Do you have any trouble, you know, just identifying yourself as a Jew at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  No, not I, but my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">My sister, who did not know she was Jewish, because we couldn’t tell her, she was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When my cousin from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> came, even though he didn’t look that Jewish, she immediately recognized that he had a long nose, and she said, Arayed, you’re Jewish, but you’re nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And he said, but you’re Jewish too. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And she said absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">She would not believe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And it took her quite awhile before she accepted it, but I had no trouble, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I just kept going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , though. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I was so used to it, I kept going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> until they stopped me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  What did going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> give you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  Oh, just being with friends on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I mean, that was the only recreation we had during the war, you know, the only time that you dressed a little bit, whatever you had and it was a social occasion, so it was very hard to -- you know, not to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Everybody else was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Most of the people we were with was -- are, you know, officer’s families. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So that was something that I -- I missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">June 3, 2002
QUESTION:  Can you remember the very first time after the war that you felt free enough to admit that you’re a Jew to somebody in public?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Not until we left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but once we left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , then yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I was very -- I was very happy about be-being able to admit it, but I wasn’t proud of it until I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  What steps did you and your family take to rebuild your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">For example, were you able to get any rehabilitation for your hand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  There was no such thing as rehabilitation for anything in those days as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">What I did get was some help from the teachers, who tried to accommodate my -- both the lack of no -- knowing English and my lack of thumb, to do subjects that would make it easier for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And that’s why they immediately switched me to commercial subjects like shorthand, which meant that I didn’t have to spell, and typing, which means I learned how to spell by copying. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And then also arranged for me -- showed me how to use my fingers so that I wouldn’t need the thumb or the little finger, so that I could type. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I did type over a hundred words a minute at one point, so I -- I did pretty well on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I also found that I could knit, which I could before the war, before I lost my thumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And whatever I could do before, including even cutting my cuticles, I found I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">At one point they decided they wanted to help me and they got me to a doctor and the doctor was going to try June 3, 2002 to do something with my hand, they wanted to adjust my -- one of my fingers so that I could use it as a thumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I don’t know, it was -- it was a very difficult situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">My mother didn’t know what to tell me cause she was in such pain about this, and w -- I ended up being in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and already the -- getting the first shot before the anesthesia and I said no, I don’t want to do it, and I just got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I said I -- you know, I just got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and -- and thanked them and -- and never tried that one again. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I felt that it was just too difficult and I’m glad I did because my instinct just told me not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But other than that my rehabilitation was mainly my own doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The other thing I did was play table tennis, which meant that I was easier with the company I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I liked the company of boys, which was easier [indecipherable] to play table tennis. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And plus, when you play a -- a sport like table tennis or any other sport, you have no time to think of your hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">You know, I used to stand with my hand in the back so that it doesn’t show. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But when you play, you know, you have to serve, you have to put your ball up and -- and you -- you have to look at the ball, so you don’t have time for the hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And that, I think, is my cure. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">That was my cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Where were you that they were teaching you English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Yeah, my father, as I said, decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and after spending about a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we -- also they taught -- tried to June 3, 2002 teach us English there. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They taught us and -- and I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ulverston</span> , which was a little way away -- away, and I was surprised how well I was doing until I learned it was a <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But anyway, my English started getting slowly better, you know, you’re like -- 13 and a half I was by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">My sister had no problem whatsoever, but I had troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I was reading Polish books and knitting in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but they didn’t mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They let me -- they let me do what I needed to and I did math. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So that’s how I started learning English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  You mentioned a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , can you elaborate?|
ANSWER:  I -- it was a military -- I mean, it was for m -- for officer’s families. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The English were very nice to us, but it was such a hard time at the time because they were so worn out themselves that r-rationed food was very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They gave us what they gave to th -- to their own, but 1t was -- we were always hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And, as I said, we had heating only a -- a couple of hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We were in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , stacked <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and did our best that we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> with our ration cards and get some bit of clothing here and there, but mainly we lived on kippers, because you know, we were hungry for meat and meat was very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So the kippers were the only ones that you could get without rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I don’t think I’ve ever seen a kipper since, because I can’t stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But mainly that’s wh-what we ate as -- as protein. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">June 3, 2002
QUESTION:  During that period of time, were you aware of the events that were unfolding in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I -- | hardly knew what <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I had very little knowledge about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was not until they declared the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that I remember my father coming in with absolutely shining eyes and saying, we have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And that was when I really paid attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Did you follow the Nuremberg Trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I guess I was too busy with my own problems again, but I remember my mother tell -- saying that there was no punishment that she could think of that would be enough for them, so there was a lot anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But as I said, I -- I was too busy with doing other things and I was just too young to -- to think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Not very overt, but P’ll never forget when I applied for a job at the automobile association in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">The personnel officer asked me what religion I was, she said I didn’t have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But I wanted to, at that time I felt I needed to say who I was, so I said Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And she said to me, we don’t ma -- mind Jews, but you can’t have Jewish holidays off. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I was so stung by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Now, I’m not religious, but it stung me, I’ve never forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I did get the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I did very well there, too, but I’ve never forgotten that. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">June 3, 2002

<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  When did you leave <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  I left <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1968, and the reason for that was that my husband was, as I said in the U.S. Information Agency, and he wanted, for his own career development, wanted to go and expand a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="417"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is a small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He felt that in his profession, he needed a little more air. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So we thought we’d come for a year, at least that was the plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We rented our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and came with the best hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">He also wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> if possible, and I was supposed to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My son was then five and a half, so he was going to go to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And that’s how we planned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , but by the time we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> he got an offer from the <span class="BUILDING">Hoover Institute</span> , which is near <span class="BUILDING">Stamford University</span> in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So in the end we went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palo Alto</span> and that’s where we spent two and a half years and -- and he actually did some very good work at the <span class="BUILDING">Hoover Institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">He was the first Israeli to work there and the local Jewish community was very nice to us and very interested in what we were about and wanted to know more about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">This was part of the Jewish community that was never very much involved with June 3, 2002 <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and that was a time that they suddenly awa -- awoke to the fact that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was something that would be of interest to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And so we had a very, very nice social life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And he did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">He did very well, but then he changed, he went to work for San Francisco Examiner, and after awhile he felt that the only way to complete his rise in the -- in the profession, he had to come east. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So that’s -- after two and a half years we moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and he went to work for Voice of America.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  The recolatio -- recollections I have is because we both worked with <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The Americans were trying to -- to promote and to present the side on Vietnam war to the Israelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I believed what I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I did not really have my own opinion since I wasn’t living in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And later on I understood, but at the time I was all for what the American was doing -- what the Americans were doing and I thought communism was a great, great threat. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So at the time yes, I did believe that, but now I realize that it wasn’t so, that there was a different way to deal with it, that it should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And they lied to much, and they -- as usual, they didn’t tell the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And the mothers who marched deserve -- deserved a -- a -- a prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  I-I’m going to pause now and change the tape [indecipherable] End of Tape One, Side B June 3, 2002 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Halina Peabody. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">This is tape number two, side A, and you were telling me about some of the experiences in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and we had talked about <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I wanted to ask you if you had any experience with any anti-Semitism in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Iam quite aware of the fact that Jews are not loved everywhere, but not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I have not come across anybody specifically not liking me because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I had a couple experiences -- well, I had a very cute experiences at work where a lady was mad, a -- a colleague was mad at somebody because they was -- kept bugging her on the phone and she slammed the phone down saying, that Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And then looked at me and, oh Halina, I didn't mean it, I didn’t mean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And then two weeks later she said, you know, I’ve got to go have an operation, I have a wonderful Jewish doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So that was -- but from then on, you know, I understood where -- she was a redneck, so I -- I -- I guess that that was part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I know there are people who are not particularly keen on Jews, but we have lots of friends who are not Jewish and who like us, so n-n-no -- no other problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">QUESTION:  I’m going to try and ask this discreetly, but your name is now Mrs. Peabody. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Can you take me from being Mrs. Yasharoff to being Mrs. Peabody? </span><span class="sentence" id="586">June 3, 2002
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I got divorced in 1972, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">We had problems for awhile, and hoping that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> will help us, but -- moving away from families, but it didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So when my husband decided to go abroad on a mission, he went -- he went into the foreign service. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And that was the time when we really broke up, because he was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> then, and there was no <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , so it would have meant that I had to send my son to an <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I would have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> with him and I certainly couldn’t -- couldn’t have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So that was the breaking point, and so we divorced. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And he went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and I stayed here with my son, and eventually met somebody very nice, name of Richard Peabody, whose mother happens to be Jewish, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And so I wasn’t so worried, because being from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and having heard that you should not marry out of your religion even if you’re not religious, I figured he couldn’t call me a dirty Jew anyway, because he was one, technically anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And we’ve been married for the last 20 years, very happily and I hope we continue for another 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Please tell me about the work that you do for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Well, I do whatever they need. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I am working mostly in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> because they didn’t -- they were supposed to put me on Polish translations, but they don’t happen June 3, 2002 to need any work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So I work in Martin Goldman’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , who is the Director of Survivor Affairs, and I also joined the circle for -- writer’s circle there, I’m trying to put my story down from the war, which is very, very difficult for me, but I like the people there and I feel very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And when I came to the point where I felt I wanted to volunteer somewhere, I went around and I thought, where would I do best? </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And I thought, well where would I do best, th-the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> I could so is the <span class="BUILDING">U.S. Holocaust Museum</span> cause that’s where I belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I do anything they ask me for and I’m enjoying just being there and I’m on my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  What’s your reaction to the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust in recent years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  Surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I never thought it was -- I -- ve never thought it was important enough for people to know, I didn’t realize people wanted to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I’m -- I’m pleased to tell my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">It does hurt, and it does exhaust me, but I feel very much obligated any time I’m asked, to tell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I do keep telling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I’ve got a button, if you push it’ll just come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I’ve talked to a couple of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> here and there and I always feel that perhaps my story is not sufficiently big to -- to -- to -- just for the whole lecture, so I always like to take somebody else with me, and -- but I have no problem in telling it, and -- and I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And if they help me to tell it better, perhaps I would do better job at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So maybe the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> can do that for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">June 3, 2002
QUESTION:  In your opinion, do you think the American Jewish community might ever be in danger because of skinheads or neo-Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I think that we are all always in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">We always have to watch and we always have to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I think that the ameri -- <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is the safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> for Jews right now, but I certainly don’t feel completely safe anywhere in the world, especially now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  Would you like to elaborate on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  Well, because the Arabs are attacking <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and because the Moslems [indecipherable] I do believe that the whole world is in danger, but I don’t think people understand that they’re starting with the Jews just like Hitler did. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Hitler wasn’t going to just kill the Jews, he was going to kill Slavs, and whoever else, to make a perfect race. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The Moslem wants every -- want everybody to be Moslem, and be an -- just like the Al-Qaida in <span class="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So I don’t think people realize the danger, but I do, because we’ve been through it and we know what it -- what it can create. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And if <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> backs off, 1t’s going to be very, very bad for the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I just hope that they’re strong enough and that they will continue rooting them out and somehow manage to turn the world around, keep the democracies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION: <span class="COUNTRY"> Israel</span> has fought in several wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I’d like to know what your thoughts were during these times when <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">June 3, 2002
ANSWER:  Well, I had nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I was running with my son, I was hiding and -- and -- and trying to find a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Mainly, I couldn’t tell you how proud I was that they’ve always won, tha -- how strong they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And that gives me courage to think that they will survive no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">There’ll be pain, there are killings, there are murders, we lose people. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But we manage to recreate and somehow continue, and I hope that that will continue forever, so that my children can also see <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and -- and -- and grad -- great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Have you ever regretted having left <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Yes, I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I -- I loved living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I’ve -- I’ve regretted 1t many, many ways, but I find life so much easier here. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I a -- you know, I -- I suppose in my old age, I would be -- find it rather hard to go back -- especially I wouldn’t go back cause my son is here an-and his life is here, that I -- that I would never go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for that reason, but when we left, yes, I do regret. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">ve never felt as happy and as free and at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as I felt in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">But again, you know, for selfish reasons I guess I’m -- I’m comfortable here. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So one has to make accommodations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  How do you think your Holocaust experience influenced the choices that you made over the years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  I think my main reason, my main choice was to take care of th -- my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I think that this is what my mother taught me by doing what she did during the war, by June 3, 2002 putting herself out and letting anything happen just as long as she could save her kids, transferred it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So I would do the same for my kids and my grandchild and those are the choices I’ve made, always whatever’s goos -- good for my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Other than that, I have enjoyed having a lot of things that I was not allowed to have during childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I missed a lot of things by -- by being during the war and running for my life and wanted to give it to my grandchildren as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I think that was -- that’s my main -- my main outcome of the -- of the experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  You mentioned that during the time that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was at war you had nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Have you had any other recurring nightmares since -- since the Shoah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I -- ?</span><span class="sentence" id="651">ve not had many nightmares, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I happen to be quite healthy, I think, in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I don’t dream, I sleep very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So perhaps I did the right things. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I didn't -- I don’t feel guilty about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I -- I -- ’ ve often wondered why I don’t feel guilty like some people, that others didn’t survive and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I am asking the question why I survived and the others didn’t, but I don’t feel guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I think that everybody tried their best and luck was with us and God was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">That’s -- I don’t know what else I can think about that, but that’s my reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Are you involved with any survivor groups? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">June 3, 2002
ANSWER:  Oh yes, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I have been coordinator and now I’m a treasurer for the Association of Child Survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And that’s another group that I love dearly and everybody there is my best friend and -- and I wouldn’t never leave that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">This is my -- this is my -- how can I say it? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">My <span class="BUILDING">home</span> away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
