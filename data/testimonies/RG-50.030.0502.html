<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  First let me say, welcome, I’m so happy you’re doing this for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Thank you, thank you, I’m really glad to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  (Let’s just start by you telling me your name, and when you were born, and where, and give me a little family picture.) </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My name is Budd Schulberg, and I was born in really a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that is now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harlem</span> — I was born on <span class="DLF">120" Street</span> , March 27, 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And, in a way, my parents told me I was maybe the only person who was a born screenwriter, because my father wrote a photoplay — it was on a suffragist subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My mother was a suffragist, and he wrote a screenplay, a three-reel called “What Every Woman Wants” — I think it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And he got $500 for that script, which was quite a lot for those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And he told me it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. Jellyhouse — I’ve always loved that name — who delivered me, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and so I really owe my birth to film writing, you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My father was one of the earliest, very early photoplay writers, as they called them then. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">What else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  (Take us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="REGION">California</span> .) </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We left when I was about six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And my father had been working for Adolf Zukor, Famous Players, as a writer and publicist, from about the age of 18 — he started very, very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And become his own film company producer. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So we went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I really remember the ride on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was on the old Chief, Santa Fe Chief, before the Superchief, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I vaguely remember that, being out on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">observation car</span> , and watching the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> fall away behind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father and Louis Mayer, later the famous third “M” at <span class="BUILDING">MGM</span> -— the two of them together set up a very early <span class="BUILDING">film studio</span> , way downtown, not in what we call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> now, but down by the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , way downtown Los Angeles. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So both Mayer and BP, so they both were making these early silent films. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">That’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My father’s big discovery was Clara Bow. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He found her in a Brooklyn beauty contest, actually, signed her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I called Clara sort of a pre- Marilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">She was known as the, as the “It” girl, from a famous novel of the time, and movie called “It.” </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And she had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Clara really did have It. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She’s still amazing to watch in those silent films. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And that’s so —
QUESTION:  (How early did you get interested in writing?) </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Very, very early, I’d say I was about 9 or 10, very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was very much a part of our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And he, also as a kid, worked on the old Daily Mail and a short time on the old World — papers that we, that we dearly miss. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we’re down to about two and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So, so he, he had a great interest in, aside from film, in uh writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And my mother was a frustrated librarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And she set up a very big <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , thousands of books, all set up like a regular <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , all numbered like a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , a real <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My father used to — Sunday morning was a ritual. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He would read from the classics, aloud to us, Sunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It’s amazing what we read. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We read through Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, and we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years and years, we heard that. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So writing was very much part of our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So I started when I was about 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So by the time I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I just thought of myself as a writer, as if it was already my profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And it all went — it fell in place very naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I edited the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> — Los Angeles High School daily paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We had a daily paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I laugh because these days, my kids at <span class="BUILDING">Westhampton High School</span> couldn’t get out a monthly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn’t imagine putting it out every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So anyway, that’s why, so we breathed that atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that Scribners published, entitled, They Cried a Little. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Sonya said that in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where in other <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> they might have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and people might sit down — Sonya said, in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> , and as we passed we might type out a little jingle or something or a little story, and we all, Sonya and Stuart, Stuart wrote very well, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  (He was 8 years younger than you. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">That’s quite a gap when you’re kids.) </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It was, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  (Were you and your siblings very competitive?) </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I was so much the elder of the three. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And with my father and my mother divorcing when I was a teenager, 17 or 18, and Sonya and Stuart younger, uh, I was very worried about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I sort of uh, took on my father’s failed responsibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I was worrying about their <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and how they would react to a divorce, and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So I wouldn’t say we were very competitive, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  (You were born just at the time that the First World War started. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Do you have any memories of the First World War’) It’s funny, I do have. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">One memory was being on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going west, this was in 1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It’s almost the first memory I have, being on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I was about four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And, and my father’s partner, Harry Abrams, his daughter was about eight, and the two of us were in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And we stopped in a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> full of soldiers was just opposite the <span class="DLF">platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I remember looking at them and they were sort of jeering and making sort of lewd remarks about, I don’t know what they were saying, but I remember that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I remember being with my mother ona _ as the soldiers were, had just come back from World War One and were marching down <span class="DLF">5th Avenue</span> , and I’ve got just a glimpse of a memory of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It’s almost my earliest memories of World War One. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I also remember collecting silver tinfoil, balls of it that somehow were being given for the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I don’t know exactly how they used it, but those are the, those are about the only ways I relate to World War One.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  (Let’s jump forward to the approach of World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Now you have sudden success writing, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Why don’t you tell us about that period and give us a sense of Hollywood when the war started.). </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Well, 19 —, let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">When I got out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my father’s assistant, had now set up his own <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> , and was planning independent films, one of which of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born — which was the daddy of all those later Star is Borns.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  (Let’s start that sentence again.)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?) </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was just ina rage. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">When I came in, he screamed at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was almost like that Judge Freisler. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he screamed at me. “</span><span class="sentence" id="90">You’re a traitor! </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You’re a traitor!” </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Like that, he got purple, he was so mad. “</span><span class="sentence" id="93">How could you write that terrible book?!” </span><span class="sentence" id="94">he screamed at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that — my father of course was a member and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He took off the same way, and he said, “B.P. I blame you for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You should have stopped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It’s your fault.” </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He was yelling, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My father said, “Louis, I did try to stop him. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the book.” </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. “</span><span class="sentence" id="104">If you publish this book, it will ruin you. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You'll never be able to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">You’ll never get a job here again. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And not only that, it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother — who was just entering the agency — it will hurt the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">You’ve got to put — don’t publish the book.” </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My father wrote that. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Anyway, Louis Mayer said — he said, “You know what I think we should do with him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He said, “T think we should deport him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And he really meant it. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was really sort of fascinating, because I always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They thought of it as their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was like <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They ran that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And they could do anything they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He was on a weekly salary. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They paid him every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And they could do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They could cover up any crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It never got in the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And no one every heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Because they ran everything, including the press. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was really their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So when Mayer said that — it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And my father — I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he knew so much more, but he wasn’t as smart in a practical way as Louis was. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And my father said, “Louis,” he said, “maybe you’re right, but,” he said, “where do you think his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Helena</span> should be?” </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He said, “Maybe we should deport him to Catalina Island.” </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn’t think that was a bit funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by both the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was from both extremes. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and — of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And then, from then on, which pretty much I’ve done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth, which I’ve tried to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  (Remind us how old you were at that time — you were very young.) </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was about 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  (So wait till you’re finished with the water... Tell us again that you were twenty five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I mean, that’s a vulnerable time to be so berated by everyone around you.) </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">That book changed my life completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It even cost me harmony with my first love of my life, my wife, Jigee, <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It even cost me the marriage in a way, because Jigee wanted to stay west. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">She didn’t like the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And she thought the climate was bad for our little daughter Vicky, and we sort of argued about that, back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And the, she insisted, almost, on, on, that we live out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I was saying, “I can’t live out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It’s over for me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And in the east, I’m really accepted now. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And I have a new contract for a book, and I’m — my new life has begun.” </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It really planted the seeds of our breaking up eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That book changed me in every possible way. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It was really funny.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  (Give us a sense of the chronology when it was published, and then, if you could move forward to the war, which obviously changed things for everybody, right?) </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I started the book in the spring of °39. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I finished it in the, about fall of, of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was published, uh, on my birthday, uh, in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And uh, and then, then I was working on my, I was back in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was starting my second book. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And then came Pearl Harbor, and we were in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And then I, I was anxious to get in the war, and I, uh, I applied to the Marine Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Uh, and then I, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> to see my daughter and Jigee, and at that time, I spoke to the, John Ford, the famous movie director. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Ford was forming this outfit, the — called the Navy OSS Photographic Unit that would work with the, in the OSS with, with photographic in- intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And because of my book’s success, uh, Ford asked, Ford asked me, he said he would like me to be in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I then applied, with his recommendation. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And that took about six months before I was approved. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And in the meantime, I went down to <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> and waited in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> and wrote screenplays to support myself, wrote screenplays down there, for Mexican producers. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And then finally I was, I got my Navy commission and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to report to John Ford. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And that was the beginning of my war experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I was in, in for about four years, because after the war, I was with the Nuremberg Trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It seems to me, I think it was from spring of ‘42 to spring of *46 before I got, before I got out, because the last six or seven months was spent preparing a film for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , the photographic evidence for the trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  (Tell us a bit more about John Ford’s role. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So you went into the Navy, because he was in the Navy, and he already was forming this unit.) </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  (But was it solely Navy personnel?)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  (Tell us about John Ford and your story about his erratic responses to you in terms of requiring Navy behavior.) </span><span class="sentence" id="182">John Ford, of course he was a genius, but he had a, I think he had a kind of sadistic trait. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Because when I came in to report — I’d known him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> , and I was still thinking of him as a movie director and me as a young writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So I walked in and said, “Hi Jack, I’m here, like, what do you want me to do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was sort of like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And Ford was now a Navy Commander, and he said, “Ensign Schulberg, that’s no way to report to your commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Come to attention and salute and make an official report.” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I thought the guy was crazy, but I said, “Ensign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.” </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And he’s said, “That’s more like it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So he’s like a standard stiff-necked Navy commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was so typical Ford, so I say, OK, if that’s what he wants, I'll do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I don’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So the next time I come into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I give him a sal...and say, “Ensign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.” </span><span class="sentence" id="195">John Ford says to me, “Oh, for Christ’s sake, Budd, you don’t have to go through all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Let’s talk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Like now he’s just a movie director again. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">That’s the way he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He loved to keep people off balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That was a big thing with Ford, to keep them off balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Whatever you thought he was going to say, he’d say something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But he took glee in, and he said, “We’re going to send you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Schuyler</span> , and they’ Il really knock some Navy discipline into you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="204">He said, “You’re going to find it very tough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He couldn’t wait for me to suffer there, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Schuyler</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schuyler</span> — I didn’t mind it really, I found it rather interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Tough, but — and we’d run around the <span class="BUILDING">Fort</span> at 6 o’clock in the morning and go all through this stuff, and so it was sort of interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And one really funny thing happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">There were two little ensigns from the South. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">One was named Watts and the other was named Furr. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">One came from <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> and the other from <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they would always stare at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I’d be doing something and they’d look up and they were staring at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And one night after mess, I came back to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , and they came over, and they said, “Excuse me, Schulberg, would you mind if we talk to you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I said, “Well, no.” </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So they sat down

QUESTION:  (Was this in 1943? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">°447) Yes, I'd say this was ‘43, ‘44, yes, as we moved through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And then they used writers in a very creative way. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They had writers like me work with, on the team that would drop, drop agents behind the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And each agent had about, a team of about eight that took care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They all had different assignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">One would just — took care of his general welfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And, and one was involved in the aviation problems, when he could be dropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And I as a writer would work on their cover story, which was very much like writing a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was exactly like writing a character in fiction, because you would find out what they really did, and then just adjust it to what they would say when they got, if they were interrogated. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And so that was really interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Right before the end of the war, we had one, one guy who was a Danish agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I was just amazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And he’d become quite famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He had been actually dropped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or something, or got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">He went to the <span class="BUILDING">Adlon Hotel</span> , and became a big pal of some big SS general. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some kind — I forget what the hell they thought he was selling — but he became a pal and drinking buddy, and so -. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Now it was quite near the end of the war, and his main worry was that the war might end before he could do 50 drops. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He really was worried that the war would be over. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He couldn’t wait to get his fiftieth in. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And, but three days before, three or four days before the end of the war, back he went again. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I asked him, it’s against regulations really, because everything is so secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But if he ever survived, if he ever came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I’d love to know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Because it
QUESTION:  (So you had intelligence training, also — not just naval training, but intelligence training?) </span><span class="sentence" id="242">That’s right, so they sent me to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; it’s the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the CIA is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Yeah, that was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">There were a hundred or so agents, at <span class="BUILDING">agent school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We were there about a couple of months, and each one had to make up a false identity, as to who they were and what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And they just went, funny things — I said I was a sports writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">You had to of course choose something that you could talk about, or be questioned about, that they didn’t know enough about, to pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So I said I was a sports writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I didn’t say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , but close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , like Alta —_,_ that I knew enough about. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Sometimes at three o’clock in the morning, they would wake you up and shake you and say, ‘“What’s your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">What do you do?” — </span><span class="sentence" id="253">kind of like that, to try and catch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And fascinating, too, every Saturday night there was a long drinking session. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They would all be at a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and they had every kind of booze on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and they would encourage people to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And they would see who fell apart in drinking, and who didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And they would weed them out like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  (Were you good at that?) </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Yeah, I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Yeah, I had had quite a bit of training in it by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Yes, I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Yes, I passed the whole thing.</span></p>

END of Tape 1
QUESTION:  (Why don’t you tell me how Stuart was brought into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> and when that was?) </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Well, Stuart joined the Marine Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And after his Marine training — the same tough stuff — even tougher maybe that he went through — he was assigned to a film unit, a film unit in the Marine Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Meantime, I heard that we’d a slot open in our outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Someone had dropped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I forget what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Anyway, I then recommended to Ray Kellogg that we get Stuart, I said he was really very, very able. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And so they did suggest to Stuart that he apply, and Ford approved it, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And so Stuart came over, and from that time worked with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And that’s how we both happened to be, at the end of the war, involved in the Nuremberg Trial preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  (Just a little background: Did you work at all with the Signal Corps? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Did you have any connection or cooperation with the Signal Corps units, and with George Stevens’ unit?) </span><span class="sentence" id="278">No, we had no connection whatsoever with the Signal Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It drives me a little crazy, because it will never get straightened out, I don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Somehow on the Internet it says that George Stevens worked on the Nuremberg film. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I get questions many times: How was it to work with George Stevens? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And he seems inextricably bound up in our project. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I didn’t even know, know George Stevens. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I know his son quite well, but I don’t think I even ever met George Stevens. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And he had nothing whatsoever to do with our project. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">What he did, and where it got mixed up is that, apparently Stevens, at the end of the war got a film unit and went around photographing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and made several films that were, I think, quite effective. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">For one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had shot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be admissible evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But we never saw George Stevens. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I don’t think Ill ever be able to disconnect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It comes up constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It’s right there, if you find it— George Stevens worked on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">It’s one of the many, many troubles with the Internet, that’s really a big negative for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I get asked questions about Hollywood, about, did I get back to Hollywood work because I testified to the committee after the war, and I didn’t go anywhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I still felt outlawed, understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I lived in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucks County</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , and just wrote books. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But all that misinformation is set in there, and it will be there forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  (I agree.) </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And I’m sure there’Il be biographies written full of misinformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  (OK, So George Stevens had nothing to do with The Nazi Plan.)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  (And did George Stevens and his group have anything to do with John Ford and his unit?) </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They were two completely separate — I think that Stevens apparently did some very good work, but it had nothing to do with John Ford’s OSS unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  (OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Why don’t you tell us, give us some detail about how it came about, your suggestion about photographic evidence, and when you first came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , too, if you can go on to that.) </span><span class="sentence" id="310">At the end of the war, after the war was, was over, General Bill Donovan was very interested 1n, was one of the first, I think, to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major war criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And he, he called a meeting — I need some water, too, cause my mouth gets dry from talking so much. (</span><span class="sentence" id="312">Drinks) He called a meeting of, of all the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could contribute to the building of an international trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And again, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I worked much more closely with Kellogg than I did with Ford — Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford might make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So I guess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking about the importance of the impending trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to make a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I got the feeling at the meeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Anyway, each one spoke up about what they could do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS Photographic — it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we could use at, at a trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">As aresult of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would look, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And so, so I ... Then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and — with my brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So, he set up in, I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiesbaden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler’s official photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And Hoffmann, who — oddly enough, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von Schirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the Hitlerjugend. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was really ironic because in a sense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But as I point out — with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do anything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a slavish point. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, ina way. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">We would say that the — feeling anti-German at that time, because we did feel that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> really overwhelmingly had supported Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You see those crowds of millions and millions of people would turn out for
QUESTION:  (Was Hoffmann that cooperative too?) </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Hoffmann was totally cooperative with Stuart and turned over his entire treasure trove of photographs to Stuart. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Went over with his staff, he had his staff down there, the way I had up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="331">Coughing) (Drinks water)
QUESTION:  (So, Budd, when did you first go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And what did you find when you were there’) What did I find there, did you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  (When did you first get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ?) </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Very soon after we, after we set up <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> , very fancy, plush — it was like the Beverly Hills of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I guess, in a way, or even Bellaire. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And at that time, I, I uh, after we set up <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> there, then because, I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to talk with the Jackson legal staff to get the particulars of the indictments and find out, find out specifically what, what photographic, how the photographic evidence would, would dovetail with their actual indictments. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And uh from the point on we worked very closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">There was a lieutenant Jim Donovan who served as a liaison between the Jackson staff — he was on Jackson’s staff, well we all were really, we were officially on Jackson’s staff too — would work out the, the working arrangement between the indictments and what we could do to back up those indictments photographically. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And we worked with Ben Kaplan, whom I still see from time to time on the Vineyard — a very distinguished lawyer and I think a judge later, but we would work closely with them, and sometimes I was down there frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I might fly down for a few hours and fly back, and so I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> a lot, every, maybe a couple of times a week even, during that period when we were preparing the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  (What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">What was the atmosphere like’) Well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was aruin. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It was really a wreck. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And the uh, and the Germans seemed very beaten down and sort of depressed, and uh, and eager to please, really, eager to please you, and sort of scared of you, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It was very much a sense of the conquered and the conquerors. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But it was shocking to see those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> itself was, Jesus — I flew over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , and it looked like a honeycomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">There was hardly a <span class="DLF">roof</span> left in all of this enormous
QUESTION:  (Did you have any reflections on the impact of Allied bombing and whether it was justified?) </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Well, that’s a tough question, because really you might say on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , it really doesn’t seemed justified to uh bomb civilians, you know, on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> or the other, just as the Nazis were doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and we were doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> and everywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We did destroy those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">At the time, I felt that, at that time I felt that we had to do it, because we, apparently that was, they thought, the only way to win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And God knows we had to win the war if we wanted to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">At the time, at the same time, it was really horrendous to see what we had done, I mean to people, and oh God, the wreckage of tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  (I’m sorry, go ahead.) </span><span class="sentence" id="354">When I saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I, my feeling was that it would take fifty years or more to ever get it back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I was amazed at how quickly they restored those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I was amazed at the resilience of people to rebuild them. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I thought it would take all through the 20" century.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  (When did you first have real knowledge about what had been going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?) </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Um, trying to remember — there — Even before the war, there had been word, word had gotten out that there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , uh, in, in 19... let’s see, what’s it in, yeah, in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Joe, Joe Louis’s uh, when— it was a, famous story that, there was, you know, that was — Braddock’s manager was Jewish, and, and Goebbels was working very hard to set up a championship fight between Braddock the champion and Max Schmeling in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And Joe Gould, the manager — I went to see him in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> shortly before he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And whether he made it up or not, Joe Gould told me that, that he got a phone call from Schmeling in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and Max was dying to set up this rematch with Louis. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And, so he called. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Joe Gould was actually at, at <span class="BUILDING">Stillman’s Gym</span> when he got the call. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And Schmeling said, “Joe, I’m here with, with, I’m here with Mr. Goebbels in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he would like to talk to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And so there was Goebbels in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> talking to this little Jewish guy in <span class="BUILDING">Stillman’s Gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And of course now, it sounds made up, but what, what Joe Gould told me that day in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was that, he said, Goebbels said, “We’re very anxious to arrange a championship match between your fighter and our fighter, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and we, and we want to know what your conditions are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And Gould said, “Well first, I want 500,000 dollars in a <span class="BUILDING">New York bank</span> before we leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And he said that Goebbels said, “Well, that’s no problem.” </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And he said, “And also, we want, one judge must be American, and we want an English referee.” </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And he said, “Well, just a minute, I'll have to ask Mr. Schmeling.” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Then he came back he said, “Mr Schmeling says that’s OK, too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And then he said, “And we want ten first class passages, and, and first class accommodation for ten people in your best <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ,” and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And he said, “Alright that'll be alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Is there any other condition?”</span></p>

QUESTION:  (Where did you look first?) </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Stupidly, we, as a shortcut, because we were very, very worried about time — at that time it was like August, and the trial was supposed to open on the 15" of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We had no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So we got, so as a Shortcut, we thought we’d look at all the Fox Movietone footage, because actually that was produced, had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and so we got all of that, and it, I thought it didn’t answer all, all the things he was asking for, but some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And so I, I went down with a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And at that point Donovan, Jim Donovan said, “Well, Budd, that’s film that was released in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Even though the source was German, we can’t use anything that was at the influence, say, of Fox Movietonews, because the defense attorneys would jump in and say ‘That,
QUESTION:  (Do you want to clear your throat? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And then I’d like to have you go back and tell us — This was at the <span class="BUILDING">Babelsberg studio</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Mention where Avenerius was taking you. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And also, talk about, you were presumably working on 35mm film, which is very unwieldy. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Let’s go back into that, so you can tell us where, and some of those things about the film conditions, and how you could handle film, both viewing it, copying it, all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So, go ahead.) </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Well, we got so much of this film from him, as I mentioned last night, and after a few days of this, he suddenly stopped and suddenly became a little more stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Apparently his colonel had objected to his giving us so much film, even though the Soviet Union was one of the four parties represented in the prosecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But the colonel stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And then, I won’t go into so much detail, but then we had to win over the colonel, which we did with this lavish party that we threw for him, an all night into the dawn party. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">When the colonel got drunk enough and softened up,
QUESTION:  (So what you’re saying really suggests that even though there was officially a prohibition on filming any of these kinds of activities, these guys were telling you that it was filmed.) </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  (Presumably this was film that was kept highly secret, right?) </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Yes, Yes
QUESTION:  (And not something that went through the Propaganda Ministry. ) </span><span class="sentence" id="410">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  (Well that’s one question. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> is — these acres of films, was it your feeling that some of that was official German film, like the Goebbels empire, or that these were all SS film locations?) </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I don’t know if they all were, because we really couldn’t, we were not able to examine them the way that we would have wished to, but I got the feeling that these were more SS films that they were hiding, rather than the Goebbels propaganda films. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But there might have been some of both. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I really don’t know the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  (But tell us again where the German newsreel material was that you found.) </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Well, that we found mostly in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babelsberg</span> , where, that Avenerius was in charge of. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Most of that film came from there that they had — all of the newsreel film that had been shot all, all through the war, from the early days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  (Do you remember where you found the film of the trial of the bomb plotters?) </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It, it was, I really, practically found that myself, with a couple of people with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We — It was a <span class="BUILDING">film lab</span> , and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> we found about twenty, twenty reels of film, and so I just took it with us and went back and started to run it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We didn’t know what was in it, and there was the whole God damned trial of the plotters. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I was rather surprised, seeing the film did, The Nazi Plan, which had only a snippet of the trial, that I can’t remember why that was chosen, because there were far more shocking scenes than that one that we showed, that was not as abusive as some. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I don’t know why that one... For some reason, Donovan, at first he didn’t want to use any of the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">He thought that crimes against their own people would not be as germane. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I didn’t really understand it, because after all we were using film of the anti-Jewish riots and so forth, which was against their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I never really agreed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I don’t know what his reticence was about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  (Well, I wonder if 1t had anything to do with the fact that the people on trial for trying to kill Hitler were not the defendants in the <span class="DLF">dock</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">This was a really opposite polarity.) </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Well, that’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And Judge Freisler was not — God he was a horrible, but it’s true he was not on trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  (I think he was killed in an Allied bombing raid, actually, while he was in a <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> .) </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Freisler, I think he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I think he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Thank God, he was a, God what a horrible....
QUESTION:  (I share your, your passionate horror for that trial footage. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I know it very well.) </span><span class="sentence" id="440">That trial was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Then also... I don’t think, I don’t think I spoke about it last night, but the, our, our SS editors told us that the, uh, the uh, July 20" people, in being convicted, they
QUESTION:  (Filmed?) </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Filmed, I mean, yes, filmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And the idea was that they would show that to every, in every <span class="BUILDING">diplomatic center</span> , show it to all the diplomats, Nazi diplomats and High Command people, as a way of frightening them against doing something like that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">What we heard was that it, it sort of backfired. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It was so horrifying that they were afraid it would turn more people against the regime and they stopped circulating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And of course we were dying to get hold of that film. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">We were told that someone had actually sold it to someone in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and so I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , trying to find out if I could get the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And a guy, a guy came to my <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and said that he had the film, and, and he asked me how much I would pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I forget what I said — I had been told, I think, that we could go up to 5000. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I think I started at 2500. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And he said, he wouldn’t even think of it for 2500, and then we got up to 5000. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And he came back and said, “I’ve got other people interested also, in it and I think they might be willing to pay more than 5000.” </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And then I only had permission for five, so I had to call Ray Kellogg and find out how much more we could pay than 5000. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And it took time and red tape, and meanwhile this little guy came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I waited there in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and he came back and looked at me, and I think he asked some exorbitant amount like 10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I said, well, I don’t have that yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And he said, “Well, I have someone who’s willing to pay and I’ve decided not to come back any more, and I’m going to sell it to him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And apparently they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Apparently it was Nazi people in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , where a great many had been able to reach and survive, and they bought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And I went back empty-handed. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I was very disappointed I didn’t get the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">If they’d given me enough money, if they had said 20,000... It was almost, it was like buying a Hollywood story, but — going back to my boss to ask how much money can I give him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  (Was he a German? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Was this little man a German?) </span><span class="sentence" id="465">No, I thought he was Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I thought he was Swiss and not German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  (You know, everyone’s still looking for that film — still looking for it.) </span><span class="sentence" id="468">These two people, they had seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And they described that film to me, said it was the most horrifying thing because the people lived for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And it was really gruesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But it’s never been seen, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  (So who were the people who described — ) It’s way down in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , maybe, or somewhere, that film.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  (But not in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You see a lot of speculation is that it got to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  (No, and I think the Russians would have exposed it if they had it.)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  (So who told you about actually seeing the film?) </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I’m trying to think — I’m trying to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Curt von Molo told me that he had not seen the film, but that someone had, that he knew had seen the film and told him about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But he himself had not actually worked on that film. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">In fact, that there wasn’t anything to edit. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Apparently they just photographed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  (So when you had to choose material for the Nazi Plan, I assume you were trying to show the defendants, in action, among other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">How did you decide what to keep and what to throw out?) </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Well, it was awfully tough, because we had such an embarrassment of riches. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We had so God damn much material. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">What I would do is more or less make a list of what we had and then go down check it out with Jim Donovan. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And he would say ‘Yes’ to that — specifically, things like the self-incriminating statements, like, like Goering, Goering reading the racist laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So he said — In fact, watching the film yesterday, for the ordinary public, it’s a shame we can’t subtitle it, because Goering was saying something about the Jews, like that we need to sweep <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> clean with a steel broom, things like that, that were incriminating, so many things they were saying that were definitely in breach of international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So it was just a question really of, of very difficult selection and, and elimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I had told Jim Donovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to 5, and we could run all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And he said, well obviously, we can’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And we finally worked it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Jim Donovan suggested four hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the indictment that our film would relate to, but it, the... We had four film editors and they literally worked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mean, they worked until two and three in the morning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And that film unit had so damn much film —
QUESTION:  (Tell us more about the editors and particularly I’m interested in Joe Zigman since he also worked on the other film.) </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We had three very good Hollywood film editors: Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and Bob Webb. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And then we had one Russian girl — I swear to God, I don’t remember how she got assigned to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">She was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">She was a very small Russian newsreel editor. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I think her name was (Shostopol) or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And so the four of them would work around the clock, looking at this film and then trying to follow a sort of a rough outline that I would make. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Let’s see now, we start in 1930 and we show highlights before Hitler comes in, and then, we sort of outlined it step by step, and then
QUESTION:  (And were they handling original films, or did you make work copies? </span><span class="sentence" id="503">How did they do that?) </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Let’s see, at first we just looked at the original film, and then as we started making our selections, we would, then we would make copies of the footage that they were selecting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  (And the bosses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> — describe again how, how they wanted to review the film work.) </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Well, for one thing, they would say something, that they needed a photograph or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">The next day, they’d be calling and saying, “Well, where is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Bring it down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We would try to explain, that first we have to select, we have to edit it, we have to — they never understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They never understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And General Donovan was very impatient. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">He had no patience with us at all, none at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Because he would promise things on a high level that couldn’t be fulfilled down where we were, and that was the trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And he would be embarrassed, “Well, where is it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So that, uh.... Donovan finally pulled, he himself pulled out of the trial, as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">His, his nose was out of joint because he was jealous of Justice Jackson, and he didn’t want to play second fiddle to Jackson, really and so, eventually he withdrew completely, but that didn’t stop us, but we were left in <span class="NPIP">place</span> without Donovan, to finish the work that we’d been asked to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  (So when you were working that quickly, and you got a little more time because the trial was postponed —) Thank God. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">When they said September 15" — we, we debated whether to go down and admit, I don’t think that there couldn’t be any photographic evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">You'll have to— Even though Jackson in his opening day remarks mentioned that, I think, it was historic, it was the first time ever that there would be — it was not only the first international trial, but the first trial I believe that ever used photographic, film photographic evidence that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And we were almost ready to say we can’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And then word came, it’s been postponed until October 15". </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And then we had a month’s leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But as we got toward October 15" we weren’t ready either. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We still had like a month’s work, even killing ourselves with the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And then thank God came this second postponement to November. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And that really saved us, because without that, there wouldn’t have been any Nazi Plan film in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  (And when it was shown, I’m imagining — was it a film with tape joins, or had you made a print from, from the assembled material?) </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Yes, we ‘d made a print of the condensed four hour version, yeah, yes, but as noted Ray Kellogg had to — he testified as to the authenticity of the film, that it was all German film and so forth,
QUESTION:  (Did you ever consider whether you had too many Nazi Party rallies’) I was worried about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I was worried about the party rallies, but at the same time, the party rallies included two valuable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">One was what they actually said at those rallies, which as it moved on, became more and more inflammatory as they got more and more powerful, and as the western democracies surrendered to them, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They became more and more aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So there was that sense of, of growing confidence in their aggression that you can’t trace. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And also, there were people whose very presence indicted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">People would say that we, like Speer was one, and Schacht was another — and a number of people — and Keitel and Jodl — but people who said they were just German officials but not necessarily Nazi Party related. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And showing them with their Nazi badges and things was, was very helpful in indicting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And, and Riefenstahl was helpful in identifying various people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  (Let’s talk about Leni Riefenstahl. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Were going to change tape again, ...so we won’t talk about Leni yet.)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  (When you showed the Nazi Plan in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Were the defendants glad to see themselves up on the screen?) </span><span class="sentence" id="541">No, I really wouldn’t describe it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">No, I don’t think they were overjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I think they were worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They looked worried really. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They looked very, they were very concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Goering 1s, 1s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Goering was by far the smartest of all the people on trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I remember the day at our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , when the captain psychiatrist came rushing in, all excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">He’d been testing the IQs of the various defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And he said, “My God, that Goering he acts like a clown. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">He’s a genius.” </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He said, “His IQ went through the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , he’s so smart.” </span><span class="sentence" id="553">That guy’s name was Murphy, Captain Murphy, who strangely enough years later committed suicide also. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I don’t remember why. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But Goering tended to take the whole trial very seriously, as I mentioned last night. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He acted like, as a defendant was who feels that he has a chance of being found not guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I don’t know if he really thought so, but that’s the way he acted, and that was his demeanor most of the time in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He would take notes, and he would consult with his attorney, and so forth, and he took it very seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Some just sat like, as if they were staring. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Streicher had a funny look on his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And the two military people, Keitel of the Army and Adm. Jodl [sic] very clearly, very clearly were saying, were disassociating, their attitude was, we shouldn’t be here, and we have nothing to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And they would sort of turn away, and act rather haughty, like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They were all kind of different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  (in the dark?) </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Well, it was dark except for the light of the screen. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I could see them though.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  (Did you feel proud of your work’) I guess so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  (interruption) I was feeling awfully relieved that we had it in time, I think that was my main emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It was really touch and go, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I mean I would get calls twice a day, “How is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Is it ready?” </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It was also, I just couldn’t take it down and show it. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I had to take it down and screen it for Jackson’s staff to make sure it was all germane, and, and I was very worried about that too — that they might say “No you can’t” — and they were very haughty, I mean they, their attitude toward us was sort of, “Who needs them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I mean, “They’re just a pain in the ass, sort of a nuisance,” I felt, and we don’t really, they were such — not Donovan, but Ben Kaplan and the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  (OK, I think we’re out of here, right?) </span><span class="sentence" id="576">END Tape 2
QUESTION:  (Did she speak English?) </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Yes, she could speak English, I guess quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">She spoke fairly well — accented, but fairly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I didn’t need an interpreter with her, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  (How did you use her’)

<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  (Who wrote the intertitles for The Nazi Plan’) Well, I think I did, with the people that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We had this German prosecutor who had — I never quite understood how — he had defected in ’41 and got to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I think probably through the efforts of the OSS he somehow got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> on German business or something, and then defected. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And he was a very helpful of course in defining for us what we were looking at.</span></p>

QUESTION:  (And they were entered into evidence separately...) Yeah, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">They were entered separately
QUESTION:  (Were you and Stuart together when you went through OSS training?) </span><span class="sentence" id="606">No, no we weren’t at all, because my training preceded Stuart’s, as I’d been in for almost a year, I think, before Stuart was transferred to the Marine Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I’m not sure that...see, I’m not sure that Stuart went through that, what you might call <span class="BUILDING">spy school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I don’t remember that he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  (Were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> together?) </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Oh yes, it was at the <span class="BUILDING">south Agriculture Building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">That’s where I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was treated like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It was referred to as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And we would “go ashore” and all this nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  (You know it’s right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> ?) </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I'll be damned. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">No, I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">That’s where we were every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">That’s really ironic.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  (Did Von Molo & Rothe ever ask you about being Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Did they ever bring the subject up?) </span><span class="sentence" id="647">No, not that I remember — no, I don’t remember them ever, no, I don’t, I don’t think they did.</span></p>

QUESTION:  (Tell us more about attending the Dachau Trial — how long were you there)? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I was only there about a week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">In fact, 1t was so typical there. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">The, the, the pattern of denial was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The commander’s name was Wolf, and I swear to God, he looked kind of Jewish and had the Jewish name of Wolf. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And his defense was sort of like, it really was, his defense was sort of like — “Well, I tried to save as many as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Like I could have killed 35 or 40 thousand a week but I only killed 17 thousand.” </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It was like he saved the lives of all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">That was, that attitude went all the way down the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">There was one big stupid looking guard, and he was accused of maltreating the Jewish prisoners, and he actually said, he said, “Well, this woman, you see,” he said, “I was under orders, I had to kick her,” he said, “but I didn’t kick her nearly as hard as, I was trying to kick her as little as”’.. It was, all the way down the <span class="DLF">line</span> that was the attitude — that they did it as little as possible to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I loved that thing about the kicking. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They only kicked her a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  (Was Stuart with you at all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Did I ask you that already?) </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It was just a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">It seems to me — I wonder if Sandra could confirm this — as far as I can remember, Stuart, I don’t think he was there on the, when we showed the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I think by that time Stuart — I’m quite sure had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I think he had finished his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I just remember him at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">But I don’t remember working with Stuart all the way through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  (Take us a little farther along into the Pare Lorentz documentary, and that project as it emerged.) </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I was living out on my <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And I got back from the war in, I think it was February of ’46 was when I finally got released from the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And I got, I bought that <span class="DLF">farm</span> out in <span class="REGION">Bucks County</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And Pare Lorentz came out to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Oddly enough, he was married to the girl, Elizabeth Graham, that I had worked with as a co-writer for Selznick. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And I knew her very, very well, liked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And so he came out to see me to describe the film he was planning to make on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , and he thought that after my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> experience, I would be the logical one to write and work with him on the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And I told him that I had been in the war for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I had just gotten out and now I had a contract for a novel with Random House, and they were actually paying me so much a month as an advance, and I was living on that, and so I had to go back and get started on my other career. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">He then tried again, sometime afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I saw him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he again urged me to write this, he was very set on doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And at that point, we talked about Stuart. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Stuart actually had done an excellent job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I mean on his he was very able and very smart with it, and so it just seemed a logical, logical job for Stuart, which Pare then proceeded to work with Stu.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  (Did you follow very closely the making of the project? </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Were you in touch with Stuart much?)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  (Do you remember at all hearing about this remarkable film footage that Stuart uncovered of this killing? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Well, I just remember hearing about it once — that they actually had finally found something that we had hoped to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We never really found anything that was related to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We had hoped to. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And we’d been told there was such film, but we had never uncovered it, so I was fascinated by what Stuart did, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I wish we could have shown that at the trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  (I’m sure you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Who told you that there was footage of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Was this more from your SS editors?) </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Yes, yes, they said that it, it also had been photographed, yeah. (</span><span class="sentence" id="700">Did you ever come across Walter Frentz, who had worked with Leni Riefenstahl as a cameraman on the Olympics film?) </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I remember his name but I don’t recall talking to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I remember his name, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  (Because he filmed some of those things you put in The Nazi Plan, you know.) </span><span class="sentence" id="704">No, I don’t remember talking to him directly, only hearing about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  (Is there anything you could tell us about the link between the fact that Stuart and Joe Zigman worked on both The Nazi Plan and the Nuremberg documentary? </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Do you have any thoughts about that continuity between them?) </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Well, only that, I think that Stuart, in getting ready to make that film with Pare, that a very logical, the most logical film editor would have been someone who worked on The Nazi Plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And he was very friendly with Joe Zigman. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And, I think Bob Parrish had gone back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> and was building his own career right after he got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And so I think that Joe was the logical choice for, and an ideal choice for Stuart. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I remember him very well too, Zigman. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">He was an awfully good person. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  (SS editors — How did the main film editors use them? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Were they used as assistant editors? </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Cutting?) </span><span class="sentence" id="723">No, I don’t recall them, I don’t recall them.... They were much more just advising as to what film was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I don’t think that they, I don’t remember them ever actually working on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Moviola</span> , editing the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  (And Movieolas are what you used, right?) </span><span class="sentence" id="726">That’s what they used then, oh yes, God, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Hours and hours and hours at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Moviola</span> 
QUESTION:  (Separate tracks for sound?) </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Yes, I think there were separate tracks, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  (For your material for The Nazi Plan, if | understand correctly, you only used original tracks that were found with the films?) </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Absolutely, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">That’s the only thing we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">We couldn’t use anything that was not the German original, and nothing else, because they thought the defense attorneys would pounce on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And by the way, the defense attorneys took their jobs very seriously, because it was not like a routine, cut and dried. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">They really, they were all excellent German lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And they worked very diligently and would make, I mean their, they argued very hard for their clients; they really did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  (Did you have a sense that there was anxiety on the part of the prosecution, as to whether the film evidence would be accepted and valid in supporting the indictment?) </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Well, uh, only at the beginning — at the beginning, much more than later. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I would say that gradually, they became impressed with how detailed the dovetailing of the film and the statements were to what they had on paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And so the, I think the confidence grew as, as we went along, and that when they found that statements and pictures really were incriminating, they felt that it would bolster their case. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I think it was quite surprising and very enterprising of Justice Jackson, coming from the background that he did — after all, he wasn’t John Ford from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> — that he was as, as, as open to the use of film, which was so innovative and had never been done, as he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He was really very sympathetic to its use, as long as, as long as we were diligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Ben Kaplan who’s this very nice guy that I still talk to on the Vineyard. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He was very, very tough, and he was rather snooty about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I mean, he was doing it because they told him, but his heart wasn’t really in it, I don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">But he would put it to very tough legal tests as to whether it was just movies or it really was, really was indictable evidence, which was good, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">That was useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  (I believe that was the standard. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Visual images could be entered as long as they were pertinent, directly pertinent to the charge.) </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Exactly, exactly, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And that’s what he held us to. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  (Well, that must have made your job really hard at the beginning, when they hadn’t decided yet what the indictments were going to be.) </span><span class="sentence" id="753">That’s very true. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">At the beginning, the whole thing was so, so nebulous, that we almost had to try to read their minds as to what they would be looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">We had to decide — these non-legal minds of ours — what did seem to us indictable evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Yeah, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">We had pretty good — but I must say, looking back, that we had a pretty good sense of what was really verbal and visual crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">We had some sense of tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  (Do you know what was done with the original film elements when you were finished?) </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Well, I was very nervous about that, because, for one thing, on the July 20", all that film, I had something which, there was some army colonel that was attached to us, and we found out that he had taken some of that film and sold it to some American company. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And I just hit the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , because all this stuff was very valuable in a private profit-making way. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">It was all very hot film, you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I had nightmares about how people might try to grab it and steal it and, and, and sell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And this colonel in the army, I asked that, I talked to Kellogg about him and asked that he be removed from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I talked to people about — you must not —everybody has to be absolutely, totally honest about this, and, and scrupulous about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We must send all of it back to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> , and nowhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I sent all of the film to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  (So, you must have required security even for the <span class="INT_SPACE">cutting rooms</span> ?) </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Well, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Yes we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Yes they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Yes, we were concerned about that, yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  (We only have a couple more minutes...) Ok.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  (Do you want to describe some more about the Watts Workshop? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">That seems like a wonderful...) Well, I... . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40", and, and uh saw these men who are now about 60 years old, who were really uh kids some were quite almost wild kids who were running the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and, uh, it was very, it was very moving for me to, when I, I call on the phone to University of California at Northridge, and, and, the voice I hear is this very deep, profound-sounding voice saying, this is Professor Scott, please leave a message, and I think of this Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nineteen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and throwing Molotov cocktails and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">When I went down there, I went down on the first day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it was pretty wild still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were still smoking and smoldering, and there were little fires in the different open lots, and it was very, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea, sort of a wild idea, of starting a writer’s workshop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it was kind of a <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westminster</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I just put a sign up on the bulletin board saying “Writer’s Workshop, anybody interested sign below.” </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And I said I would be back every Wednesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It took me a long time, for about 2 2 months nobody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Nobody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I just sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I just sat there, and I learned a lot about Watts. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I read the local paper, The Sentinel, I talked with the social workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I went down in the, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">pool hall</span> , sat around there, got kind of snubbed and glared at. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I learned a lot, and my wife Geraldine was sort of taunting me about this, and she said, ’'d come back and she said, “Well, what happened?” </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I'd say, “Well nobody showed up.”</span></p>
