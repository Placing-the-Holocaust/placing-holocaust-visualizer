<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  I'd like to start by having you tell us your name when you were born and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you were born in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My name is George Havas, I was born in 1929 and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 's name was Mukachevo (aka Munkacz in Hungarian). </span><span class="sentence" id="4">At that time it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me something about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and how many things you remember, earliest things you remember as a small child about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , what it looked like, what the environment was like there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Town</span> was, I should mention it's part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> , the population was about between 28 and 30,000 and kind of old fashioned by today's standards and about half of the population was Jewish, other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> were Hungarian and Ruthenian and at that time when I was born, there were also Czechs living there, the Czechs were the administrative people and the officers in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">There were many <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , at various levels, there were maybe four or five <span class="BUILDING">elementary schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Some of them were let's say, Hungarian or Czech or I think there was only one all <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> , I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there were also many <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and also a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew High School</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were lined, many of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were lined with <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> , all kinds of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , they were selling everything possible, like textiles, fabrics, clothing, shoes, shirts and porcelain, anything you wanted you could buy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">There were also various <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , like there was a <span class="BUILDING">tobacco factory</span> , there were, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">match factory</span> and there was <span class="BUILDING">alcohol factory</span> and people worked in the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> and there were also various classes of people, I mean lower class, middle class and the professionals, there were many, many doctors, many attorneys and poorer people and all kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was surrounded by many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The rural people brought in produce and vegetables, chickens and things of that sort and that was <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days and they used to come in with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and sell things at a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> or sometimes you could buy things from them on the <span class="DLF">street</span> as they were going towards the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and everything was fresh and from producer to consumer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  And your family, tell me about your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  My father was a doctor and he had a general practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Leo Havas. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And most of his patients were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , sometimes somebody was seriously sick, they put him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with either horses or oxen and just dragged him into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and brought him to the doctor and it was like a different century from the way things are today. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">There were, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there many have been four people who had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The rest of the people just walked, the 01:06 most common way of going anywhere was by walking, if you had to go to some distance, you hired a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> , a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And there was a place in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where these were lined up and while they were waiting they were eating hay, the horses and the drivers were just lounging around or sitting around. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">If you wanted to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was 42 kilometers away, where my father's parents lived and we used to go on a Sunday to a section on <span class="DLF">Main Street</span> where there were taxicabs, these were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> and sometimes we used to get together with some other people and hire one and go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and just to wait for us and certain time we came back with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So just 42 kilometers which is like, I don't know, maybe 35 miles, was an adventure, going somewhere that distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Or let's say if you wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , which was at the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , sometimes people used to hire a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to go there [with the] to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Plus you had suitcases, so it was simpler to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and go over there that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I don't know if you want me to tell you about the Czechs, they were interesting, I mean it was, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was at that time, perhaps the only democratic or the most democratic country in <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> , but again it was, the Czechs were running the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they were, there were Czechs and there were other nationalities but the officers and the government were mainly in the hands of the Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Once, supposedly when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> joined the republic, which was in 1919, they were promised autonomy but the Czechs never gave it to them because the Czechs never considered anybody else capable of running his own affairs except themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And same within <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> too, the Slovaks were living in their own <span class="REGION">area</span> , but 01:08 many of the positions were held by Czechs and of course Slovaks resented it and to some extent I suppose the Ruthenians also resented it and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathians</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  But as a child growing up in the thirties, how did this division manifest itself, how were you made aware of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Or were you aware of it at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  It was I could say a schizoid existence, I mean since the Czechs were the ruling caste, you might say, my father wanted me to become Czech, which, he didn't realize it and I only found out let's say decades after the war that you cannot become Czech, I mean you can be a citizen of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> but you have to be born in the <span class="DLF">Czech lines</span> and you have to be Czech several generations back to be a Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we spoke Hungarian, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I spoke Czech and I had Czech friends and with whom I spoke Czech, since I spoke both languages fluently, like kids do usually, without accents and it was kind of, I was trying to be a Czech with the Czechs and at the same time speaking Hungarian at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which sort of was, as I said before, kind 01:10 of a schizoid existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Did the Czechs behave differently, did your Czech friends have different attitudes about things than your Hungarian friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Did they do different things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  The Hungarian friends were not Hungarians, they were Jewish, see 1t goes way back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was originally part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria-Hungary</span> and part of, within <span class="COUNTRY">Austria Hungary</span> , it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and anybody who wanted to exist at that time, or get ahead had to learn Hungarian and that's where the Jews became sort of broken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The ones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> continued speaking Yiddish, the ones who wanted to get ahead learned Hungarian and just by that fact alone, they became separated from those who didn't and if let's say my father wanted to go to, first he had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> before he went to <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and those <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were at that time Hungarian language, there was only Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And then came the war and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> became, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was divided up and the part where we were became <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> eventually, so there were these different nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Some Jews consider themselves Hungarian because they spoke Hungarian and they just thought they were Hungarian and some just considered themselves Jewish and would say if there was a census, they said they are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Some Jews consider 01:12 themselves Czechs, but as I told you they would have considered themselves Czechs but they were really not accepted by the Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And on the same thing, my father was more or less encouraging me to be friendly with Czech boys and I felt comfortable with them but there was this conflict that you speak in different language at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you speak a different language with us, so what are you really? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And then he wanted me to join a Czech gymnastic society which was called Sokol, which was very nationalistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It has a long tradition in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> , the <span class="REGION">Czech lands</span> , and they admitted me for the exercises, but they kept forever postponing, giving me membership certificate or a membership booklet or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And all kinds of excuses, but they wouldn't give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And the other thing was lots of the Czechs did not like Jews, but the big difference was that the Czechs did not persecute us. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That's one thing not to like Jews and that's the next step is to hate Jews, then the next step is to kill Jews and so there was a big difference, but already by the age of maybe five or six, I knew that some people hated me just for being Jewish and that's the kind of world 01:14 it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Let's say I knew about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I knew about Nazis before I was even six and possibly I knew more than kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> because I was exposed to more things and we had a radio and we had newsreels, newsreels in the movies, and more contact with things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Were these things a topic of discussion in your family constantly, too, because . . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">.Did your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Not constantly, but 1t was. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Things were talked about and let's say maybe I had bigger ears than some other kids and I overheard many things and I listen in on things and the word Nazi was in the dictionary, I mean in our spoken dictionary and I knew that word, I did not know it's full meaning, but I knew that word you might say as early as six. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Czech elementary school</span> , one of the courses which they were teaching us was Civil Air Defense and they showed us films of gas bombings, fire bombings and things of that sort and how to defend against those kinds of things, so let's say maybe at an age of eight or nine, I was already exposed to those kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Children at that same age in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , they never heard of things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I remember film where they were showing us the effect of a certain poison gas and the person was vomiting like a white foam was coming out of his mouth, I mean I knew about the effects, I mean like simulating things and things of that sort so I couldn't understand how they made that person vomit or how they could make that white come out of his mouth but they were showing films of that sort and so it was war time even before there was a war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  You had a sense of being vulnerable because you were Jewish or just that there was something out there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Getting back to the Sokols, the Sokols were not fond of Jews, but they let me exercise there, whereas once I was participating in something at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and part of it was putting up a dance, a group of us kids had to dress up in a certain way and we were doing some Czech national dance or Slovak national dance and I wanted to change clothes to get into that special outfit and some Czech boys were there in <span class="BUILDING">scout tents</span> and my father was with me so one of them, with great reluctance, let me change in his <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> and told us we don't want Jews in our scouts, and Czech scouts did not admit Jews, so I was aware of differences and I was aware that certain things were not accessible to me because of my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And in the same time I had to learn to read Hebrew for the services in <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> and how will you be ready for Bar Mitzvah if you don't learn it and this and that and my grandmother was religious and all four of my grandparents were religious so I was brought up in that tradition, I had great difficulty in reading Hebrew, to read Hebrew and it was just, I mean as a kid, the letters are different, the words don't mean anything and it was not taught as a living language at that time and it just for me was very difficult but somehow the kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , they learned it and they could read it like fast and recite the prayers fast and 01:19 I never managed to acquire that, so they were way ahead of us on that front. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And then, I'd say our first contact, I mean first thing which affected us, which we noticed was when the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , there were some refugees came to live in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and if you look on the map of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it changed suddenly, suddenly the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> was surrounded by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and it was just foreboding and we sort of knew, we had the idea that we would be next, but nobody wanted to believe and everybody was hoping that it wouldn't happen somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Plus <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had treaties, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had a defense treaty with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had a defense treaty with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , so we thought we were safe, that the French would protect us and the British would protect the French and the Czechs also had some kind of treaties with the Soviet Union but there were catches in that like the Soviet Union would come to the help of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> if <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I think, the catch was only if <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> first came to our assistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The second problem was that <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had no direct <span class="DLF">border</span> with the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The direct, closest <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> would not permit the passage of Russian units across it's <span class="REGION">territory</span> to 01:21 help <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , under no circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So it was a weird situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And backtracking a little bit, for some weird reason about two weeks ago or so, I had a nightmare which brought back that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was just put away out of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">In '37 or '36, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span> in the summer for a short vacation and we met there some German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was a German couple and they had two sons and I was there with my mother and with my cousin, my father stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he had to work and earn money. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And somehow these people did not know that we were Jewish and they were using our, sharing our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabana</span> at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> and on one occasion the man took me to the water and washed off my feet and then he was going to bring me to the cabana so my feet wouldn't get sand on them and I don't know how, which supposedly was not my habit, but I let my pants down or something and he noticed that I was Jewish and that ended our relationship or our contact and the next day or maybe that same day, the two boys beat me up for no reason, they just slapped me and slugged me and my face was burning red from the beating and I'd say that was my first beating I got for being Jewish and I was at that time maybe seven or eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Do you remember what your mother said, or what she did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  She wasn't with me, she was up 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they sort of caught me while I was near that pension or something on the <span class="DLF">pathway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">There was nothing she could do, I think she 01:24 complained to the man and the man just shrugged it, oh that's just kid stuff or just nothing and _, don't worry about it, but after that we had no contact with them or they had no contact with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They were willing to dry themselves and change clothes any odd way but they were no longer using our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I forgot this, I mean a person forgets things and I, as I said I don't know what brought it back to my mind now, but I could feel my face burning like it did at that time, like it was, what 1936 or '37, which is what, 60 years, 59, 60 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Then everything changed in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The Sudeten Germans started agitating, first they wanted concessions from the Czechs, they wanted to have their own language, they wanted to have more rights, more self-government and things of that sort and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in which they, they had <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> , so it's hard to really point out what more they wanted, all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They reached a point where it boiled down to what they really want is to detach that whole <span class="REGION">area</span> where they lived and have that <span class="REGION">area</span> joined to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to the Third Reich, to Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">There was no more negotiation after that and there were, the whole thing was orchestrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and managed from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then eventually the French, in a cowardly way and dishonest way, they let <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> down, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , Daladier, the French Prime Minister and Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister and they sold us out and that treason, that betrayal, it's permanently in the Czech history, no matter what those would do, those two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , the Czechs or <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it could not be erased.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Do you remember when that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yes, it was in the summer of '38 we were no longer, we would have liked to go again to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , to the seacoast, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span> , that was canceled. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , to, I don't know what you want to call it, a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> 01:27 (Teplitsa). </span><span class="sentence" id="79">On the way in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we could see from the <span class="DLF">window</span> that fortifications were being built, which was the <span class="DLF">border</span> facing <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and the Czechs were fortifying that <span class="DLF">border</span> , the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> , which faced <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was already well fortified, but they continued building more and more and more fortifications and we knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">In early September, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> declared mobilization and my father was, same as all other men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , were called into service. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">All of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> mobilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">According to the plan, my father had to report to some <span class="BUILDING">underground hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brno</span> , which is in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and there were just, the only men in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were like, according to what the American called 4-F's, who were not fit for military Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Do you remember when he left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  No, I don't remember when he left, but I remember that he was gone and I remember when he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I remember that our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> to start with, a large <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> , it was traditionally a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">garrison town</span> and there were many <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> there and going way back, probably to the day of the Austra-Hungarian times and the Czechs continued that tradition and there were many military units in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> all the time and our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> happened to be on a main <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we could always see the soldiers either marching or rolling on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> moving and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was shaking when those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were going by on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> so and they were very proud of them, they were, we kids were proud of the Czech army and we had confidence in the Czech army, in the Czechoslovak army and our weapons, I mean we knew we were well equipped and the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was that way, we had what I suppose the Americans would call spunk, we had self confidence and we had determination and that's when, during the mobilization, the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> was increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">There were many, many soldiers and what, the day a mobilization is carried out, let's say, people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> were assigned to units in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> , people from <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> were assigned to units in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and so forth, everything is mixed so it would, people from <span class="REGION">local areas</span> would be in different areas and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was full of let's say soldiers from let's say <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and training and going by on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were modern, some of them had 10 wheels on them, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">terrain vehicles</span> , for all kinds of terrain and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunks</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabs</span> had holes in them for emptying out the machine guns, so it 01:31 was, equipment was contemporary, modern and the troops couldn't move and some, many of the troops were also Cavalry and the artillery were horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But much of it was mechanized, much of it was motorized, so it was a modern army. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And that's when this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> came, it was a horrible let down for the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , for us and in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  What happened in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  It was the sadness, a horrible sadness and people, some of them, people were from, the teachers were from <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and some of their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were being taken over, after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , by the Germans and one blow followed another. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">This was, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> took place at September 30th. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And then the Hungarians kept, started pressuring for the return of <span class="REGION">territory</span> , what they call return, which were Hungarian population . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> happened to have a sizable Hungarian population and there was, on November 2nd there was a conference at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , because the Czechs and Hungarians couldn't agree among themselves, which <span class="REGION">territory</span> should be given over to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , so this was turned over to the Foreign Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they drew the <span class="DLF">border line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And on the evening of November 2nd, a radio was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , so we were having supper in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> so we could be near the radio and hear the news and they started reading off the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , going from west to east, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> will be turned over to the Hungarians and he's reading <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosice</span> , which is already <span class="REGION">eastern Slovakia</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uzhgorod</span> , which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> , 43 kilometers to the west of us and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mukatchevo</span> and then Baranog(ph) and when he said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mukatchevo</span> ), which is our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , my father virtually choked on his food, because he, let's say, put, in old expression, all his money on the Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He was trying to bring us up as Czechs, we were trying to be Czech and he knew the Hungarians from experience he had before, after World War 1, during World War 1, and it was a total shock for him and he changed and our whole life changed as a result of that, let's say, the Hungarians called it they are liberating us. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">To us it was they are occupying us and that took place on November 10th, eight days after what was called the Vienna arbitrage. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The last Czech units pulled out around two in the afternoon, it was a beautiful, sunny day, mild and the last to leave were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and it was just, to me, to us, 1t was a heartbreaking scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Did you go to watch them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  We were all at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Everybody was at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , all along the <span class="DLF">street</span> , on every <span class="DLF">street</span> which faced the main <span class="DLF">roads</span> , people were in the <span class="DLF">window</span> watching the Czechs pull out and waiting to see the Hungarians pull in. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And late afternoon, the Hungarians started pulling in and they were coming in on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle units</span> and they were coming in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , which were what the Czechs called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tankettes</span> , which are called, in World War 2, they were called by the British, Bren gun carriers. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">In other words, small caterpillar tracked vehicles, which were like nothing compared to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech tanks</span> , I mean it was, it was just, I don't know what you want to call it, flabbergasting or a shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Here a strong army 1s forced to withdraw without firing a shot, without defending, betrayed and in come these weird looking people with weird looking equipment and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ford trucks</span> , which <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> sold them for money, to the Hungarian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">All the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech trucks</span> were Czech made, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech tanks</span> were Czech made. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And this was on a Thursday and the people were cheering them, whether they meant it or 01:37: not, they knew that it would be advantageous or safe thing to look like they are welcoming the new, the new powers or the new regime or the new forces or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And you might say history was taking place in front of our eyes on our own <span class="DLF">street</span> and the next morning again, history takes place. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Hungarian soldiers with rifles and fixed bayonets are escorting local people, arrested local people and they are being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And there goes a group, maybe four civilians, or five civilians or six and four soldiers with rifles and fixed bayonets. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And 10 minutes later another group and another group and all day people are being arrested and taken away and why, it was a chance for anybody to get even with other people or enemies and stuff like that and people were informing on each other and they had lists drawn up before they got there and they are going to arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Did you see people you knew being taken away”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  No, but...
QUESTION:  At the time, could you figure out any pattern, at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  My father was shaking like, I supposed that they might taken him because he was friendly towards the Czechs and now the Czechs are gone and they're going to get even with anybody who was friendly towards the Czechs and who was not a loyal Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">If you're a local person, you should be loyal to the Hungarians, you had no business kowtowing to the Czechs and they didn't take him, but we heard rumors and all kinds of things that the people were badly beaten, that they were tortured and there was one name whom I remember, who vanished. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And he was later, some drunk Hungarian gendarme said, oh he had a tough skull, but we cracked it never the less. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And nobody spoke about it and nobody knew about it and in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> later on, we heard that, behind what they called the <span class="BUILDING">gendarmerie(ph) barracks</span> , there were people buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There were no arrest warrants, there were no records or anything and so they could do most anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">That was a word which may be strange to you, gendarmerie, well in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there were police, in the <span class="REGION">rural areas</span> they called them gendarmerie and they had different uniforms and different customs and that's what they were called and again, it was tradition in Europe, all the way maybe, entire 01:40: central and <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> and even <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> and even in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> there were rural police and there were in-town police and they were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And it was just a completely new world, it was terror and fear and...
QUESTION:  Did your father continue to have his medical practice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  There was a man in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who was the leading Hungarian during the Czech regime, while it was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and he sort of kept, did the equivalent of what the Sudeten Germans did in the <span class="REGION">Sudeten area</span> , in other words, the resistance to the Czechs and agitating towards the Czechs, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and when the Hungarians came in he became, let's say king.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  What was his name, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, his name was Vazari, Vazari, Aladar and he and my father were enemies, so naturally as soon as the thing changed, it was extremely bad for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">All the doctors had to report to king Vazari and explain their misdeeds during the Czech occupation and sort of show, I'm guessing, let's say what you might call show cause why you should be permitted to continue practice as a doctor, why you should be admitted to be a Hungarian or something of that sort, why you should still have your license or something like that, and I don't know how many doctors from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> got called in, maybe 20 out of 50 or, I don't know, but my father was among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Let's say 19 of the 20 were certified, the only one who wasn't was my father, out of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was, as far as I can remember, there 01:43 was no appeal or there, maybe he tried some appeal and tried to drag out something, but the final word came down, you are not permitted to practice, take off the signs from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my father continued practicing illegally, clandestinely or secretly, I don't know which way you want to phrase it or put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And it was stress, it was stress on him and stress was passed on to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Before you go on, do you have any idea what kinds of activities your father was engaged in that could have caused this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Just being, trying to pass as a Czech, having sent his children to <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span> , when there was a good <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span> available, I mean quote, unquote, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> was the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Why did you send your children to <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span> and again, in the <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span> , we had, at the end of the year we had what in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is called a report card, but over there it was a sheet of paper, on which was the name of the student and I believe that among other things which was written at the top was name, date of birth, was also the nationality and I think that I was entered there as Czech and the Czechs did not protest, you say you're a Czech, fine, put him down a Czech, but when the Hungarians came in and I had to transfer to <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span> , I had to show the certificate from the previous year, at which year I was, at which level I was, so I would be placed in the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span> and the person who was in charge there was again, a very loyal Hungarian, loyal from the Hungarian point of view, who saw to it that the certificate is turned into the hands of Vazari(ph) and it's, clearly it says here that this child was declared as Czech and not only that, my younger brother, he had a middle name, a Czech middle name, in addition. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">His name was Robert, but to make it Czech-er, my father added <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , which was not common over there, nobody had middle names, it was very uncommon. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And so it wasn't enough for him to be listed as a Czech, he even gave him a Czech name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Was he, to your knowledge, involved in any kinds of political activities or outspoken in any way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  No, he wasn't outspoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">01:46:
QUESTION:  He was not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  No, he was, to my great surprise, he told me once, years later, during the occupation, I got to talking to him about the Czech parties, political parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">In 1934 there were elections in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and the strongest party was the Agrarian, the number one and I remember the name social democrats and the name of maybe one other party and there was even a Zionist party and they managed to get one man into the <span class="BUILDING">Czech parliament</span> , so I said, did you vote for the Agrarian? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He says, no, they were crooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I said, did you vote for the social democrats, he said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So I was at the end of my list, I said, well what did you vote for? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The Communists, they were the only honest ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And later on I found out that he cooperated with the Communists, when the Communists were beaten up by the Czech police in some kind of a demonstration or something, they used to take him clandestinely through <span class="DLF">back streets</span> , to the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , where he was treating them, giving them first aid or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But far as I know, that was secret, nobody knew about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">You asked me about early memories and going back, backtracking, probably one of the earliest ones, again looking out from our <span class="DLF">windows</span> , where the first of many demonstrations, thousands and thousands of people were marching every first of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And just marching with banners and on both sides, Czech police with nightsticks, escort, but it was just amazing how many people were, I don't know how to phrase it, let's say loyal to that cause, how many people identified with that cause and every year people in clean clothes and spruced up and people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> had red paper ribbons in the wheels and the spokes and red banners and bands and marching bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The bands from the tobacco factory workers and all those and it was just interesting, I don't know how else to put it and it was, it was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  It was tolerated by ...
ANSWER:  No, it was not tolerated, it was part of the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The Communist Party was outlawed in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Soon as the Hungarians took over, they got hold of those people who were leaning Communist and they went after those and they beat them, they arrested them and then the first chance they had they tried them and they imprisoned them, when they already got to that stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="147"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> had, see I'm jumping back and forth, it's impossible to keep everything in chronological order and sequences. </span><span class="sentence" id="148"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> had an interesting way, it had a regular army and it also had an 01:50: army like an SS army. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It wasn't SS, it was like an army of volunteers which went on attacks against <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when it was still, originally <span class="REGION">Czech territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They used to infiltrate across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They tried to kill Czech soldiers, they tried to blow up things and they tried to, various sabotage acts and things of that sort, but where as they had, the Germans did identical things in the <span class="REGION">Sudeten area</span> , they blew up <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , they killed people who were, let's say German socialists or Czechs or stuff like that and they attacked <span class="DLF">Czech border posts</span> , they attacked <span class="DLF">Czech customs posts</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Czech gendarmerie stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Well the Hungarians tried to do the same thing except they were not successful and the Czechs intercepted them, captured them and imprisoned them and held them and tortured them and who knows what they did to them, but once the Vienna Arbitrage came and the Hungarians took over, they had to turn them loose, they had to release all these prisoners, but they continued their activities even during a time of war, there were organizations which let's say -- one day our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was, I don't know what to call it, raided or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">You look out from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> as always, it was a custom then, always looking out from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> to see what's going on and the <span class="DLF">street</span> is blocked off. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Hungarian soldiers with rifles and bayonets and some kind of people are going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and searching. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And they come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they search like bandits, I mean like robbers or like police here, I mean police are same in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Pulling out all <span class="INT_SPACE">drawers</span> , turning over the drawers and there were some, always used to go into all the <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and always looking for things and pictures and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My father or my mother had a stack of postcards, picture postcards and I always used to go through those, but there was some drawers which they wouldn't let me in and now everything was tossed open, everything was lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And it was like bandits coming into your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and tossing things about in front of your own eyes, with absolute authority and we had, you didn't know what was coming out of it and my younger brother had a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he outgrew that too, so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was just put into an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , thinking of empty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> again, sidetracking, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> became empty because we sold the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , hoping to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So we sold the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , one with a big <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and fancy one which we only used on state occasions, when the American family came to visit us, we had dinner there and the other one was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was in there and for some reason, my father kept that math book from the <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> and he stuck it into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and when they came searching, they tossed everything apart and they came on the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Says, what is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he says, it's a math book. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Says, but it's not Hungarian, what is it and I says it's Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Are you hoping that the Czechs will be coming back here? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So, I mean it was a hostile world, it was a, it just, very, very bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> and 01:55: I don't know, they couldn't find anything else so they found we had too many bars of soap, toilet soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Says, what is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Toilet soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And this? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Says, what do you need so much toilet soap for? </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Says, pack up these two boxes and turn them in to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And they went through other <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> the same way, taking away this, taking away that and the next day, people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , who had bigger mouths than my father or who had better positions or more, let's say, just one comparison, saying Doctor _1s still practicing, or was still permitted to practice, people in that class or in that category. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They went to the mayor and they complained that this was taken away or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We had nothing to do with this, we didn't even know about this, I mean this was, we had nothing to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And then we will investigate this. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Investigated, investigated, oh this was a completely illegal thing, we didn't know who did this, we don't know who did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I mean they get, the soldiers get assigned to them to carry out the blocking off of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , the guarding of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and all that stuff, but nobody knows how it happened or who had the authority or who pulled it or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So it was a, as I said, it was a government in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and there was a quasi-government or something, which could do all kinds of things and get away with it and be tolerated and be funded. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I mean, they were drawing their pay and all that stuff from certain secret funds, let's say the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  This searching of your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , did that happen fairly soon after the Hungarians came in? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">No? </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Not right away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  No, that happened, I can't place it exactly, it might have been, it might have been '40 or ‘41.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Immediately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Oh, another thing, the Hungarians came in, as soon as they came in it was already, a law was debated in <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> which was called the anti-Jewish law, I mean they didn't call it anti-Jewish, they called it the Jewish law, but it was an anti-Jewish law, which would deprive Jews from being, it was similar to the Nuremberg laws in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Jews could not be in this aspect of public life, Jews could not be that, Jews could not be here, they could not be journalists, they could not be university professors, if they wanted to go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there would be a quota, like six percent, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Jews could not have licenses to have <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , it's just, all kinds of restrictions and depriving people of a livelihood, expropriating <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> , property, means of trade and all kinds of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And it was a different world.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Well, let's say for one thing the Hungarians had a similar thing to the Hitler Jugend_, which was called Leventer(Ph) and everybody was all, any kid over 12 year old had to be in it, it was like a pre-military training, but did not involve any weapons or anything at that point yet, 1t was mainly sort of to be in a group, be in an organization, be under command, be drilled, perform together, march together and things of that sort and again, let's say I should say that I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian Gymnasium</span> , which is <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> , and I became, in 1939 I was 10 and it was, for me it was a big step in life, going from <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> to this,big, <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , which was an eight year school and I went there for the first two years and my father had the notion that I should do very well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so I could get into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and in that respect he was quite unrealistic and quite, just wouldn't accept the world as it was because no matter what kind of grades I would have gotten in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the chances of my getting into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> with my father being not on the top, on the accepted list or preferred list was virtually nil. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Second, we should have, 02:04: in '38 when the clouds were coming in over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , we were thinking of coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where my mother had four brothers and they were willing to send us, they did send us what they were called, affidavits, which could, might get us visas to come here, immigration visas, but my father was reluctant to leave his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which meant so much to him and leave his practice, I'm still talking about 1938, he didn't see into the future, none of us did and he did not know that it would become <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and he thought it would stay <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And his main argument was that he didn't want to work in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as an orderly until he could get his board certification or whatever was needed in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to become a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And so he was hard on me to excel in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and study hard and I mentioned that we had a class of about 35 or 40 students in that class which I entered and out of those there were five or six of us Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And four out of the five were leading students, I mean we were hustling and we were working hard and getting the grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">This was, I entered in '39 and in 1940 I entered the second class and before I finished the second class rumors started circulating that Jews will not be permitted to continue in this <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian state gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and from now on, any Jewish boy who wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , will go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And came 1941 and my father came in to register and they said yes, well, but you knew that we were not admitting any more Jews to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so my father pretended he didn't know that, that's all? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So during that time when I had this warning, I started learning Hebrew, the modern Hebrew, which was the official language of the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So he had another new language for me and I already had Latin, was studying Latin and this and that and again Hebrew was again very hard for me, I don't know why, it just was hard and I had to learn it from beginning, we had to get hold of books which covered the elementary Hebrew and to get up to this level which was the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And not only was Hebrew being taught as a language, physics was taught in Hebrew, Algebra was taught in Hebrew, so it was a new ballgame as they say and it was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And we had to join this Levnter_ and if you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you participated in it at your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so I was now in the third year of <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and I was part of Leventer_ and the instructor came to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all over 12 were put into a separate <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and were lecturing to us about, let's say about nothing and we were going down into the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> and doing calisthenics there and stuff like that, but they didn't last long. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">After a while they decided that there will be no more Jews in the Hungarian army, they will all be in labor units and instead of having Hungarian military uniforms, they will be wearing their own civilian clothes and they will be wearing a 10 centimeter wide, yellow armband, to make sure that everybody knows that they are Jewish and maybe in the beginning they still had military caps, but that was the only thing on them, the cap and the yellow armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Same way, no more Jews in the Leventer, from now on yellow armband on anybody from 12 years up and you will be in pre-labor units. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So in all case it meant on a certain day of the week, the whole unit from the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> would march off to the agricultural, I don't know what you would want to call it, <span class="BUILDING">professional school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> and work there with manure and things like that, help the kids who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and with the dirty work. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And my father managed to get me out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He managed to switch my urine with a patients urine and, or give me the patients urine and I poured it into the test tube and submitted it as my own and they saw that I had kidney disease and so I managed to stay out of that paramilitary work unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But that was how it affected me personally, so I got out of that and my classmates did not appreciate that, my Jewish classmates, it's a funny thing it was, let's say my, not my first experience, but one of my many experiences with Jews against Jews, the total, the animosity between, among Jews, the hostility for different things, one reason or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I think the first hostility I ran into was when I went to, during that first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went during the Hungarian occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Why the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span> , not too far, couple of blocks from where I lived, it was a very old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and most of the students were poor Jewish kids and they hated me from the word go because I was middle class and they were lower class and as I found out later on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there was no bigger hatred than a poor Jew had towards a Jew who was not poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So these kids used to tell me things like, "geh in d'r'erd arine", which I couldn't quite understand and I did not have that good a communication with either my father or my mother, but I had excellent lines of communication with my grandmother and my grandmother knew Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So did my father, so did my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I took it to my grandmother, grandmother, what does this mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">She said, drop dead or you should be buried or something, well, literally. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So she says, tell them this, next time they tell you that, tell them this, so I went back and I told them that and they were surprised, where did you get that? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So after that I was a little bit more accepted, since I could talk back to them, it lent a certain kind of a recognition or something, I don't know what you want to call it, I was on their level now. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So I am, getting back now to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , it was again a completely different ball game, for one thing, during the Hungarians, the word Jew was a derogatory word, I mean, I learned, that was a new thing to me, any one of my classmates, there was only one classmate who used to come by and he was the number one or the number two student in the class, real strong too. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He never laid a hand on me, he never hit me or anything, but any time he went by me he said Zido(Ph), Jew and he could have said, what the Hungarians would say, like in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> then in the south they never say Yankees, they always say damn Yankees, so in Hungarian it was never zido, it was always bido Zido, stinking Jew, stinking Jew and always when I heard that, it's, for a time, eleven, twelve year old, it's I don't know, you hear it all the time and still it irks and it's not something you get used to and it still, you don't build up a thick skin to it and it just, so that's how it affected me personally and when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew high school</span> there was no more of it, nobody could call me Zido because everybody was Zido 02:15 there, everybody was Jewish, but again there was this, there were fellows from different socio-economic levels and there was friction, there was much friction, there was much hostility and there was no, no solidarity, no cohesion, no, there was never among Jews, it's really sad, it's really, they're always, two poor Jews have a stronger bond than just Jew and Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I mean it was always mattered to them, let's say you are from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and this fellow is from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> so we have something 1n common and already we have more in common with, we have common with each other was we have nothing in common with that kid from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mukachevo</span> , was called Munkacz_ during the Hungarian (occupation), so I lived in a weird world. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I can't say at this point it was schizoid, it was schizoid before, it was just weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And my father got drafted into the labor unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">First of all he was in the Austro-Hungarian army, he was a lieutenant in the medical service, as a kid fresh out of, after one year of <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> that had rank of an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">When the Czechs mobilized they made him a private because he was a lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So I thought now we are in Hungarian and he used to be a lieutenant, so he'll be a lieutenant again. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">No, (he was) not recognized, so eventually no Jew was any more recognized anyway, so he was drafted in the labor unit and somehow he managed to get into a labor unit which had a commander with whom he managed to get along all right, so he didn't have to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And the other ones who were there had to work and there was not a good unit, but somehow he managed to get along there and eventually he got discharged and then got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but during that time we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without him and again jumping things, my father, after awhile, found it, no more practicing secretly, he was, he tried to get a front man to work with, another doctor with whom he could, to whom he could take the patients across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and sort of share and split the fee or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And through that doctor we met other people and we had, it improved our social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So that's just an aside, as far as that goes, was a minor improvement in my existence, because I was among more people now and again my father was a living terror with us and it was...
QUESTION:  How was your father a living terror? </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You started, you referred to that earlier, you said it was hard on you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  He was extremely hard, he was, for things which he considered, I don't know, too many things were punishable in his mind and other things for which I expected to be punished I was not punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So if there was disorder in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which seems to be my nature, I got a horrible beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">If I was raising <span class="NPIP">hell</span> with my younger brother, we were arguing or fighting and screaming and yelling, that was enough reason for him to fly out of his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , which was inside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a belt, a heavy belt in his hand and just hit wherever, first, last, without looking, just as long as he hit body. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And schoolwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I was lazy, I could study, but I didn't like to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Sometimes he used to say, are you prepared, are you prepared for the lesson, you have the lesson, you studied? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Are you ready to recite it? </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Because in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was always recitation, written exams were given like maybe just four times a year or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">All right, come into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and give me the, recite this assignment and turned out I didn't know nothing, I didn't, I just wasn't prepared, I was hoping to bluff my way through it or something and so I got horrible beatings, but I got beatings already as a kid, on one occasion we carried on, we raised <span class="NPIP">hell</span> or something and it ended up both of us were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> after we got such a beating and so as I said, when he was under more pressure himself, passed it on, we got more beatings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  And your mother couldn't do anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  That's why you felt close with your grandmother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And my mother, if she interfered, he just shoved her out of the way across the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , she went flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And on that one occasion when it was a Latin lesson and I didn't learn it and I didn't know it and it had to be known, it had to be known, learned and exactly and he took me and he started beating me and study it and beat it and beating and studying and beating and, and so finally my mother got either the maid or somebody to run to my grandmother who lived a kilometer away, get her up in the night, this was already dragging into the night and get my grandmother to come and rescue me from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He wouldn't lay a hand on my grandmother, he had more respect for her than for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And, but I told her not to interfere and I learned a lesson and to him it justified it. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I mean, I can recite it today, 56 years later or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">To him things like that meant much, that they were very important and once I was, I hit a small pebble somewhere on the <span class="DLF">street</span> when I was still in <span class="BUILDING">Czech elementary school</span> and I was just going along in the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and kicking it and kicking it and every time it rolled off, I kicked it back and I was going with it all the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was a good long, maybe a mile or I don't know how far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And it rolled off a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I kicked it back, 1t went through a <span class="DLF">store window</span> , so I was horrified that I was going to get a horrible beating and I ran from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but they spotted me and I was a lone kid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I mean they knew me, I was Dr. Havas's son, so they 02:24 went after him, the kid broke our <span class="DLF">store window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And he came looking for the kid and the kid was hidden behind a <span class="DLF">door</span> and he went by and I figured if not now, I'll get it later, but that was a normal thing for a child, by him, so I didn't get a beating for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">There were inconsistencies like that, so 1t was a confusing, confusing world for this kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And all right now, we go back to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> and by then the load was bad and eventually the Germans came in, which was March, 1944 and from then on, everything was already just going, not going downhill, it was just avalanching downhill, fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And first thing, we had a shortwave radio which, somehow inconsistently, Jews were permitted to have radios and some Jews, to show that they are totally innocent had the shortwave band sealed on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> , so nobody could ever accuse them of listening in to forbidden foreign broadcasts and so they could not be accused of that and they could not be punished for that, whereas we had shortwave and we were listening to it, regularly, every day, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and on good days to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It meant a lot on some days, when there were good news, but on too many days, there were no good news. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">All you have to do is look at the history of World War 2 and see how it went for the Germans, how it went for the Japanese and took a long, long time before it started turning and the front was very, very far from us to do us any good when it started to turn in our favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And in March, 1944, Russians were the closest and they were hundreds of miles away, far, too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So the radio got taken away and it was just, you can't imagine the difference between having access to the world and suddenly having no access whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Did you .... This information was only available on the radio, there was nothing left that was printed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  What was printed was lies, what was printed was full of legal words, let's say, you had to read between the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and even so, let's say, our heroic forces are conducting defensive battles in such and such <span class="REGION">area</span> , so we already knew that if they were in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , they were so many kilometers from the <span class="REGION">area</span> where they were before, so obviously they are retreating and they have been, they have been retreating, <span class="DLF">lines</span> were broken through and they are doing great wonders but they are 80 kilometers to the rear, or 40 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Sometimes advances were measured, let's say five kilometers, very small, but still. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And after that, the next step was, all Jews must wear a 10 centimeter diameter yellow star sewn on their clothes, not just attached and on the penalty of such and such not to remove that star, not to hide it and then Jews could not be out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> after a certain hour in the evening and it was Passover and we went to grandmother's as always for the Passover seder, but this time it was very short and we had to get back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and it was like state of siege.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Couldn't be out, you couldn't be out after dark?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And look out on a Saturday in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and everywhere you see 1s Hungarian soldiers again with rifles and fixed bayonets and it was just horrible being at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with all this external pressure, internal pressure and my father had the good fortune on January 6 of '44, he had a heart attack, so he was just recuperating when the Germans came in and he was not yet completely and he said let's get to Grandmother's, it was always get to Grandmother, I mean if there was a beating in store or some trap or something, always to Grandmother's, it was like <span class="BUILDING">asylum</span> and everything else, it was just a place where I could get understanding, a 02:30 place where I could have love and security and safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So we sneaked out and somehow we got by the soldiers who were on the corner, my brother and I and we said we're just going to Grandmother's or something and they let us by and then we go down the next <span class="DLF">street</span> and we go down half the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we get intercepted by Hungarian soldiers again and these were draftees, they were older guys, well older, let's say they were like 32 or 33 or which, 35, compared to other soldiers they were older. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And we tried to talk to them, he said look, I'll let you through, but suppose you get to the next <span class="NPIP">corner</span> , what's going to be there, I mean suppose the guy there stops you and what are you going to say? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That I let you through and this and what, said, little kids, go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it will be simpler. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So, all right, I could, I was then not quite 15, but I could tell a decent man when I saw one and I took his advice and we went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  How old was your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  13.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Two years younger?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Yeah, not quite 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And next thing we get the word that there will be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> set up in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we had a rough outline which <span class="DLF">streets</span> will be in it, which <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> will be in it and it will be going into effect on April 19, exactly one month from the day the Germans took over and all Jews from all the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  How did you learn about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Word of mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It's just absurd, I mean everything is absurd, I mean, that's my favorite word, my whole life and everything and it's just, so we had one more conference with Grandmother, Grandmother is going to move in with some cousins, or with someone, a sister and we would be moving in with the people across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and get our things together, a handful of clothing or something like that and next morning, banging on our <span class="DLF">doors</span> , like at seven in the morning are Hungarian police. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">By this time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was full of recruit police, in other words, police trainees, not the regular ones who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and whom just about everybody knew, these were new police and different, in gray uniforms where the regular police had black ones, these were new ones and they were all rabid, they were all trained to hate and beat and kill Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I mean it was, you will now be hearing this until it's in your blood, so it got into their blood and so there was one of these and a detective, I mean what they call a plain clothes police. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And he says, you're Havas? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Your whole family come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Says where, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Don't ask questions, come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Says, take a couple of things with you and come on along. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Said well, my father tried to gain time, which was pointless. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He says, well, they took the thing over to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or things. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Who told you to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to take your things to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So we gained something like five minutes, he says we will be back in five minutes, you better be ready and ready or not your coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And at that time, in one of these empty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , which we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , we had an officer quartered, a Hungarian lieutenant colonel, who was a staff officer and my mother started banging on his <span class="DLF">door</span> and sir, where are they taking us, what are they going to do to us, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So the colonel comes out looking like he's all sleepy, which he wasn't, because he got up earlier than that usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Says, oh I really don't know, I really don't know about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">There was some talk about something at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> yesterday, but I don't know really, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So we got out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> already with the police with the rifle and the detective and other people are being lined up and they are marching us and more people from an other <span class="DLF">street</span> , a side <span class="DLF">street</span> , an villagesother. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And they are marching us to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> inside the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and sit down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> or the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> or dirt and they're bringing 1n more people and nobody knows anything, nobody knows where they taking us or what and wait there and wait there and wait there and a locked in <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you couldn't get out of it, even if there were no guards and it was mid-afternoon or something like that, I'm not exactly sure of the time any more of that, it was a horrible day and there would be many more like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  And the four of you were together?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  But all Jewish people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So then they line us up, when the time came, early afternoon or midafternoon, they start marching us, again nobody knows where and marching, marching, marching, heading out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with police escort with rifles all around and we come to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and it turned out that the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> was turned into an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">assembly camp</span> for people from all the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , all the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , they were rounded up the same day when Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> had been taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The people, the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were brought into the <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">There were two <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , one at one <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , they were both way out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , well not, there were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , but then, outside the city limit, outside the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And people from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> and on foot and all kinds of ways of being brought into the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and us special cases are being brought there to and again you didn't know why you were being punished or what and they confiscated lumber from a <span class="DLF">Jewish lumber yard</span> and they are building a three meter high <span class="DLF">fence</span> all around the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and the only one there who was, I don't know what, how to, what label to stick on him, anyway, he was an official of the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , a clerk, a manager and he, the Germans came in on him and the Hungarian police on that same morning and told him, you, out of this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , take out all your file stuff, all your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinets</span> , out. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">You are out of here by this evening and he said, but, but, but, but, but, but, you know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">file cabinet</span> , 40 or 50 years of operation of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and where am I going to put it? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">He said, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So we ran into him and he knew my father or he knew this and he knew that and he was nice to us and he put us up into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> which I don't know what used to be there before, but there are no <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and bricks and clay and dust and he found us a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which was just off one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kilns</span> and he says, I'll get you some hay, which was better than straw and you can have this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> as a separate and the villagers will be lying in the <span class="BUILDING">kilns</span> , no <span class="DLF">windows</span> , no nothing, just horrible and nothing and my father says, I'd like to get the kids out of here, I'd like to get the kids out. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Suddenly you know, it's again these inconsistencies that he would give his life for the family, but while the family was still his family, he didn't know how to handle them, I mean, he was beating us but now suddenly he would give his life to save the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Couldn't save his wife because they knew about her, same way they knew about us, there was no way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So we should be smuggled out of the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and we should be smuggled to someone with patients in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , somebody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but this is where is comes in, which people always ask, why didn't you hide, why didn't you run away, why didn't you go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> , why didn't you go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?

<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Oh, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  At the, in the, away from the center and my mother and my Grandmother in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> also lived at the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But he had many patients in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and somebody, even our cleaning woman could have hidden us, but I don't know, I hate to lose time on somebody else's story, but the cleaning woman told me in '89, when I went back there, that there was a Jewish man in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a shopkeeper, who had a two year old daughter and he wanted to hide, let's say palm off that daughter to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , anybody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He knew the villagers, the villagers shopped from him, the villagers knew him and he knew them and he went to them and begged them, because he knew the two year old would be a hindrance, no matter what happened, we did not know what would happen, but a two year old would be a problem and nobody wanted to take in the kid and my cleaning lady said, why should they, I mean the kid will stick out, the kid didn't speak Hungarian, the kid didn't speak Russian, the kid could only speak Yiddish and if one takes it in, somebody's going to inform on that person because everybody had enemies, that's the kind of world it was, everybody had enemies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , everybody had enemies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and at first opportunity they informed on other people like that and I said well they could have hid the child somewhere, so, no, nobody wanted the kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So, naturally the kid got killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and so did it's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I, coming back to my story, it was just, I was never a boy scout, I never lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I never did any hiking, I never did any camping, I couldn't live in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> alone, where would I get food? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The first peasant who bumped on me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> would turn me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Even if they didn't hate Jews, they didn't like Jews and there was just, the only way would have been it, as I said, if I would have been taken out on March the 20th or 19th and given to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and if that person would have been 100 percent loyal and if that person could have gotten me into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or into his <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> without my being seen, our being seen, my brother and I. In our whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of 15,000 Jews, two families were hidden, two or three, by Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">02:45:

<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  They were hidden by Christians in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And one hid by himself in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> which he had built and he was discovered, but he was discovered after they took away all the Jews already, so as far as I know they took him to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">interment camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but I'm not sure about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It doesn't matter, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But anyway, then we were just horribly tired on that April 19th when we arrived at that <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , 1t was already dark, it was night and we haven't eaten all day, but that was a minor point, who cared for eating at a time like this, or who could eat anything at a time like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">At most you were just very thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So we stretched out on the straw, I mean the hay and I finally got up in the morning, there were already <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> are being built around the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , the <span class="DLF">fence</span> is already being completed, the three meter high <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The one night during which we could have escaped, again, I don't know where to, but we could have escaped, was gone and there was no more after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Did you talk about escaping that night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Tomorrow we'll figure out something. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It's something which haunts me to this day, it will haunt me to my dying day, but it could have been done, it wasn't done and then my father started working, he'll do everything to get us out one way or another and started making friends with an SS lieutenant who was in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Stumpfer(ph) or something like, either a captain or the next below the captain in the SS ranks. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And he managed to be friends and then he kept us telling, I'll get you out, I'll get you out, so he going to get us out, I started nagging him, I said, you said yesterday you're going to get us out, he said I'm working on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I says you going to get us out when, when are you going to get us out? </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And this point I hated him like I have never hated anybody probably and I was just nagging him and he was nagging us, he nagged, when he couldn't beat, when he decided that I was too old to be beaten, he used psychological terror on me and he continued to do that even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , he said, I don't know how you two kids will survive, I don't know how you two kids will survive, you are the most unsurviving kids, un, I don't know the English word, I never could figure out the equivalent word for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Unviable or something like that, you just, you'll just never manage, you'll just never manage and who needs to hear that kind of stuff, I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And it certainly doesn't build up your morale, it doesn't strengthen, it doesn't add to your stamina, it doesn't anything and then one day he says run to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , there 1s a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , jump on it as soon as you can and you are going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And that was May 11th, after having me in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> from April 19 until May 11, we jump on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , which used to carry either food or bread or something between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and we got to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the driver said, these three have permits, my mother and my brother and I and the police who was standing at the <span class="DLF">ghetto entrance</span> says okay and through <span class="DLF">back yards</span> and back ways we got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where Grandmother was and, which was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from our original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but our original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="DLF">road</span> was the separate <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And this was 11th, which was Thursday, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Some days one remembers and it was a different world, people were still sleeping in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , all the <span class="DLF">fences</span> between the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were torn down, had to be torn down so people could go from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to another without going out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> there was a <span class="DLF">trench</span> dug, like maybe two meters deep, anti- aircraft trench or shelter, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">All kinds of things just to keep the Jews busy, just to harass them, just to be on their backs all the time and somebody found a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> for me to sleep in, somebody found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for my mother and somebody for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And you wouldn't believe this but there was, in that same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there was 02:51: a patisserie, a Jewish woman and she was making ice cream, she still was making ice cream and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> had two sections which were divided by a <span class="DLF">street</span> and people could run across that <span class="DLF">street</span> from one <span class="REGION">section</span> , ghetto one to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto two</span> let's say, with the good will of the police guard and my classmates from <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , the girls were running in on Sunday to this lady who was making the ice cream and Mrs. Such and such, Mrs. Such and such, are you going to make ice cream? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I'll never make ice cream any more, and she had her face against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and she was crying and she had two daughters who were very attractive and both were being courted by detectives and the detective told her something and she was just standing in that <span class="DLF">passageway</span> , horribly crying aloud and we just knew something was up and the girls were crying and the detectives were sitting by like, that was Sunday and on Monday, Monday 02:53: before noon, messenger comes running for us inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , through all these <span class="DLF">courtyards</span> , where are you, where are you, get out right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And the police comes in with the rifle, where are you hiding, what do you think you are hiding and turns out a new, the Hungarian captain who was in charge of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the whole everything, now he was spitting blood that my father managed to get out his kids and his wife, with the help of an SS officer and not with his help and there was, that SS officer was ordered elsewhere and there was a new one in charge and there was a whole, again an American expression, a whole new ball game. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And the whole world was being turned upside down and he hustled us out, the three of us, and this police officer from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> and on the <span class="DLF">street</span> is this police captain's small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian car</span> , which is enough for three people maybe and inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> is my father and he says, get in, so in gets my mother and the two of us, my brother and I sitting on their laps and he says to the police, the police sits in the front and he's at the driver side, the police captain, he says put your rifle on these, these are dangerous people, the least chance, shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The least provocation or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So he steps on the gas and he drives us to the second <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , not where we were originally and we get there and there is already a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> on the <span class="DLF">siding</span> and so we had the idea we were being taken away, we will be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">02:55

<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  I'd no idea, no idea whatsoever, same thing when they took us on April 19th at seven A.M., we had no idea where we were going into the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , for all we knew we were being taken across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and being shot there, it just, no, no idea whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I was from the 11th of May until the 15th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  Oh, just a few days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  A few nights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  Did you see what was happening, did you go around there to see your own <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  You couldn't go around, the idea was to keep as low as you can, I stayed in that, just the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I was given that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> , where I could be and it was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from my own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I could look out, but I couldn't look out, because they told me, those people, don't go near the <span class="DLF">window</span> , because they have orders that anybody who goes near the <span class="DLF">window</span> will be shot, they will shoot through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So I didn't want to endanger their lives and they were very nice to me that they gave me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> on which to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">The only other thing I could mention that, during my stay there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , during those four nights, one of my classmates showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It turned out he became a messenger in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and it was good to have any position, I mean as long as you had a position, any position was better than no position at all, so he was important, they could send him here and there and he didn't have to dig those air raid ditches and he didn't have to be around on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and being beaten and all kinds of things, so he came to me to get my Leventer cap, 02:58 the army cap because they were collecting them, so Jews should not have military caps and there should be no way for them to melt into <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and pretend to be non-Jews and trying to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So I told him, the cap is at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , see? </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Across the <span class="DLF">street</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I've no way of getting to it and he told me things. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He told me what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">He told me the horrible things which I didn't know about, there was no communication between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and I've been trying to find him and to this day I haven't been able to find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But he was a soccer player, muscular boy, a lively boy and a go-getter and what anybody would call a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">In other words, a hustler, the Hungarians have an expression, he could survive on an ice floe, but.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  We need to change tape, so we'll take a break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  At the end of the last tape, you started to describe to me the fact that you and your family were taken away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and driven to the other, the second <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waiting, you could see that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waiting, but before you tell me what happened with your father, mother and brother, tell me what you knew at that time about the fate of other Jews that had been either from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or in the <span class="REGION">region</span> , so what could you imagine might be awaiting you at this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">03:02:
ANSWER:  Hungarian troops were fighting on what was called the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and so were Jewish labor units were assigned to that front and they were being used there to dig up <span class="DLF">mines</span> planted by the Russians or dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> or any kind of work and sometimes the Hungarian troops used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on sick leave or something like that and they talked and they told us things which were going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , mainly in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> because that's where these troops were. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And there were people sometimes coming over from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> into our <span class="REGION">area</span> , civilians and they talked and they told us, again, they told somebody and word got around and these were people whom you could trust, in other words, these were, we knew that these were fact, that these things were true. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">They told us that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the Jews were massacred in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , that they were dumped into <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> and that the earth was moving on top of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> for weeks after the shootings, after the killings, that not all of them were completely killed and the ones who came back from the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , they apparently must have met Einsatztruppen or saw them in action, they said the Jews were taken out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a <span class="DLF">field</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they were rounded up and all of them were brought together and they were surrounded and then the Germans mounted the machine gun on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they were circling around these surrounded people and they were machine- gunning them and as long as they kept on circling them and firing into them until they assumed that everybody was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So we knew about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Then, one of the things which the Hungarians started early, was this stuff about citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And that was, in all case, we had to get the papers so we could get passports, and we were trying to get passports so we could come, even still in 1940 we were trying to get somehow to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It was war was in Europe, but <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was not yet at war. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So we were rounding up our ancestors papers, birth certificates of great-grandparents and going back to the middle of the 19th century or early 19th century so we could prove that we lived, 03:05: our ancestors lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , that we did not infiltrate from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that we were local Jews and we got Hungarian citizenship, we got passports, but they got us nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">But there were other Jews who did come in from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , probably, I'm not sure how it was, but I'll presume that during the Austro-Hungarian empire, at which time <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> was part of the empire, there was no <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it was partitioned, people from there, probably for to improve their lot economically or somehow, moved from <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> or maybe even into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> proper and naturally these people could not prove their citizenship and the Hungarians knew who they were, they always knew who it was, who, I didn't mention to you that already at age 12, the same as I had to belong to the Leventers(ph), I had to have an ID card and since I was Jewish, on it was in red letter Z, for Zido, so they had track of everybody and they knew who these people were who didn't have citizenship and one day, again backtracking, the war broke out in 1941 with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and Soviet Union and the Hungarians, which were closely tied to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the military especially, the officers and higher ranks, the staff, they were all completely pro-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They found an excuse, they created an excuse, it was a phony bombing raid on Kosice, which was carried out by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> and they said that it was bombed by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Soviet planes</span> and immediately <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> declared war on the Soviet Union and attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And Hungarian army units, let's say an entire army was assigned to move in to the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So once Soviet Union was attacked, vast <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> became killing grounds, where nobody counted for anything, I mean they could murder Russian civilians, Ukranian civilians and was the start of the extermination of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It was, while they were reluctant to do something like that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> proper, didn't want to have the German people see things like that, once they were in the Soviet Union, there were no more holds, no holds barred and there were just, they had complete freedom to murder and do anything they wanted and in any way the wanted, and that's how these so-called Polish Jews who were in our <span class="REGION">area</span> were loaded up onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> and shipped into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and eventually word got back that they were all murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Years after the war, when I started doing research, I found where they were murdered and how and what and it was a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamenetz Podolsk</span> , the Kamenetz Podolsk massacre.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  Were these people all known to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  To me and to my family, but there were thousands of other Jews who never knew about this, the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> did not have access to all this kind of information. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Some of the Jews in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> did not have access to it and you just, more or less you had to be in the know. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">There was a dentist in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , he rented his <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and his <span class="INT_SPACE">home apartment</span> from us and he got drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">When he got drafted they were still taking Jews into the army, the Hungarians and again it was inconsistent, some Jews were taken into the Hungarian army and others were immediately put into the labor battalions and the labor, forced labor units and somehow he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and when his unit was rotated, he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he brought back 03:10: some things, among them were miniature Torahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">In Europe there are such things and tt's, I had one when I was a child, my Grandmother gave me one, it was a small one and he says, the Jews were being taken away in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he says that <span class="DLF">streets</span> were just littered with all kinds of things which they couldn't carry any more and where they were being taken, we didn't find out the details until later. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">What happened to them, but they were just rounded up and chased, driven like stampede and taken away and then there were other inklings, like somebody had a relative in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> were taken away and for a while there were letters and then there were, 1n the letters there were words which we could understand, but the censors missed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And from that, oh let's say, oh everything is fine, we're living fine, only the "moveth" [death] is with us, which meant that, things of that sort, or they threw in a Hungarian word which meant bad, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And then there were no more letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Same way I had, through marriage we knew some people, we were close with them, my mother's sister was married to a man whose relatives were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and somehow they used to get letters from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I imagine the letters had to be smuggled out and mailed, remailed by some Christian, Polish friends, because there was no mail coming out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And then the letters stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And then you had these rumors and words coming in from troops, who came on leave, as I said and things were sort of, one thing was corroborating another. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And then in 1943, there was some Jewish holiday, maybe it was Rosh Hashanah or something like that and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again, a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> and they were Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they were being shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> , whole loads of them and you can look at the map, see where is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacevo</span> and where is let's say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , from where these people were being taken away and how long they been on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it was warm, it was September and it was very warm and they were crying and screaming for water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  You didn't see it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  No, but I know from people. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I'm giving you second hand information, but it's reliable. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I wouldn't repeat it if 1t wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And girls from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were, one ought to have his hat off to them, they were running all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and trying to get food together and they cooked soups for these people, like from beans and whatever they could get together and people were torn because it was a holiday and it was not a day to cook food, but some nevertheless relented and these girls did everything possible and they took it out in cans and pitchers and whatever and the guards wouldn't let it on, the guards wouldn't let them give it to the people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they wouldn't open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , they wouldn't let them give water, they wouldn't anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And there was, all you had to do was say <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we knew what it meant, I mean to us it meant extermination of Jews en masse. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I mean, mass extermination and we knew that somewhere something was going on, I mean we knew about the shootings in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , we knew about the shootings in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and I should mention this one, in '43 a Slovak boy appeared in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a young boy about barely 12 at that time, I was 14 and rumor had it that he was rescued from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that he was taken from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , with the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , with all the people, together with his family and everything and the way the story was that the Germans tied them together by fours and they fired one shot through the four bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And the kid was shorter than the ones in front of them and the bullet went over his head or grazed his head and they all keeled over and they brought in some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">burial units</span> to bury them and the kid was the only one alive in that whole people, the whole group(?) </span><span class="sentence" id="422">were murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And somehow Hungarian soldiers or Jewish labor units hid him and somehow they found out that he had a grandmother or a grand-aunt living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz_</span> and they smuggled him into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the 03:17 Hungarians found out about it and somehow they didn't extradite him and they didn't arrest him and they let him stay there and I heard this and I was a very nosy or curious kid and I used to walk all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , one of the things my father insisted on, I should go on walks to get exercise, to be on fresh air, so I knew the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , every <span class="DLF">street</span> , every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , every <span class="REGION">section</span> and I knew where the kid was, so that day I went walking to the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the kid was and I was trying to get a glimpse of him, even behind his <span class="DLF">fence</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> which you couldn't see through it, somehow and I kept loitering there until I got a glimpse of him that I could say that I saw the kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">When were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , the kid was arrested and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , he didn't go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with the grandmother, he was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and just saying this doesn't illustrate anything, point, but I don't know what happened to him after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So getting back to, the two <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> were called, one was belonged to the Kaloush(ph), a person named Kaloush(ph) and the other one belonged to his father-in-law named Shyowitz(ph), so we were originally in the <span class="BUILDING">Kaloush(ph) factory</span> , which was at one end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we were taken to the Shyowitz(ph), from where there were, that Hungarian police captain handed us over to this police officer, the Hungarian told him to give us a going over, for which purpose he had a, favorite beating instrument in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> 1s a bull's penis, which is, which they dry out and it cannot be broken, in other words they can beat and beat and beat a person with it and it will not split like a piece of wood or a stick and that was their favorite, so this one had one of those and he started beating us, for any odd way and we were standing there and like 20 feet from us was the <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> and we knew that we were going to be loaded on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> and probably to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and probably shot and massacred or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But there were all these rumors, there were all these rumors circulating and spread deliberately that the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> would be taken to <span class="NPIP">inside</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But nobody knew where, or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So 03:20 we were being beaten there and beaten and then SS, who were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the whole <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> was supervised by maybe four SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They were able to handle 4,000 prisoners and one of them came by and gave my father a beating and he had a walking stick, which was diameter this thick and he just used that for beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And we were already waiting to get away from all this beating and be put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And finally the hour came and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then of course they locked the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , it was one of these <span class="DLF">rolling gates</span> and I don't know how much time went by there and they opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and they shove in an old, white haired woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  They put you in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train car</span> , were there other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Was an empty, the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was empty and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in which, I assume the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was empty and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in which we were was empty and I was trying to count the number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but I couldn't because after awhile they all merge into each other and you wouldn't believe who this old woman was, she was Vazari's(ph) Jewish mother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I mean the fate, there 1s my father, persecuted and ruined and my whole life ruined, my life ruined, his life and everything by Vazari(ph) and who sits down next to us, his mother-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  You knew her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  My mother knew her, I did not know her and she said, Wazari(ph) 1s my son-in-law, he will get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So we sit there and we sit there in the dark and warmth and it was a sunny day and the sun burning on this locked up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and then late afternoon, noise <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , screaming, yelling, shouting and you could hear beating and they open the <span class="DLF">gates</span> to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and they put a <span class="DLF">ramp</span> through it and people are running in, mobs and running and pushed in, I mean they are beating the ones behind who are pushing the ones in front and the man is yelling, but there are people here already, we're supposed to be 80 in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and three others came in addition, because they wanted to be with us because of families and there are already five people here, we are 88. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Shut up. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And they told him, you are in charge and you make sure that nobody escapes and everybody gets to their <span class="NPIP">destination</span> all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So he said, I'm in charge and he accepted that and he thought he was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So when it started getting dark somebody came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> and we are just sitting there all crowded up, 88 of us 1n this small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , I mean it was not meant to hold 88 people or 80 or 8, it was, during World War 1, they used those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> to carry 40 soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">At that time it was 40 soldiers or eight horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Now it was like the Germans could shove in like anything from 80 to 100 Jews into one of those, half suffocated them or what, didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So, and there was one 03:24: other clue. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">My father was frisked before he was taken from the Kaloush to the Shyowitz and they gave him a beating there and they took away his watch and he was protesting that he has need the watch to take pulse of, he's a doctor and he need it for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He says to him, where you going, you won't be needing that watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So again, indecipherable clues and then somebody came by after it got dark and got to the, where there was a little <span class="DLF">gap</span> in the <span class="DLF">door</span> that's gaped and he said, are the Havas's in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="449">He says, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Says I saw you when you were brought in, do you need anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Because we were just like they grabbed us off the <span class="DLF">street</span> or out of anywhere, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So we whispered to him, can you get us a coat or two, extra coats or something and most important for my father, toothbrushes, toothbrushes and toothpaste and there was one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">My father had one sensible idea when we were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they were going to kill all of us, the morphine. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">He got together what he considered would be a lethal dose for the four of us and injections and he kept it in a steel case in which doctors usually keep instruments and stuff like that, but he kept postponing it, kept postponing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  You knew this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  Did he tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Yeah, we were all in on it and we all had to agree to it and when they were taking us away, when we didn't know where on April 19th, when we were being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> but we didn't know where, I said make sure you get the morphine, make sure you take it with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So he grabbed that box with all the stuff in it and then of course we got separated from it, because they grabbed him from the <span class="BUILDING">Kaloush factory</span> and they frisked him and beat him up and they put him in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with the police captain, that was the end of the morphine, so I said, we said to him, get them from the <span class="BUILDING">medic station</span> to get your morphine. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So they did not know what it was for, they figure it was for pain killing and they brought a cassette for injections, I mean syringes and morphine ampules and said how much did you get, he said, not enough even for one person, to kill one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So, that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And so and this guy did bring us and when we asked for something else he said, wait until it gets darker because I'm afraid to come by and I'll get caught, I'll be badly, I'll get it badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So then he brought one thing at one time and another thing at another time, I mean that's what we had and it was all and two of the things he brought us from somebody, he got two raincoats, which were light, lightweight, what we used to call balloon coats and that's how I recognized myself on that picture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in that raincoat and it's light, it's like off-white, or beige color and it sticks out among all those other people who are in black or dark clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And so we are all in this thing, in this shut-up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and now we are waiting, when is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going to be starting to pull out and sometime during the night, it started to pull out and then watch which way is it going. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We knew all the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we watched and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> to a <span class="DLF">railroad junction</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I think it was Chop. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So we knew that we couldn't go, we could be heading anywhere from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chopt</span> because it was a junction point, but we knew by then that we were not going north, directly to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where the killings took place, so next thing we see was somebody, a crack in the <span class="DLF">door</span> where it's not closed completely, you could see that name, I think it may have been Kosice which is_ to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The next thing we know, we're in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , which 1s odd, because all the Slovakian Jews were taken away already, why would they take the Hungarian Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And then people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , putting their heads together, or quote unquote heads, nobody had a head and at this point in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and the SS came in and the SS took over the guarding of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so I presume that, although we didn't see them, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> up to that point was guarded either by Hungarian armed gendarmes or Hungarian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And at that point, this is unbelievable, the SS permitted, opened all the <span class="DLF">gates</span> on all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and it said, from each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> one person out with a bucket for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And then they did it again, it was a <span class="DLF">line</span> -up, it was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> with a pump and they could pump just so much and maybe four or five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> got water, all right, that's it, everybody back in, up, up, get into your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and <span class="DLF">gates</span> being shut and locked up and off we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And then we were watching, which way now, which way now and this was already <span class="REGION">foreign territory</span> , we did not know the names of the 03:31 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And then we keep on watching and the we're in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , crossing from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we recognized some Polish names, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> , but now knowing whereabouts it is and then we started saying, now are we going to go east to the <span class="DLF">killing grounds</span> or west? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So we keep on watching, and these are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">foreign towns</span> , but we later, one way or another, by the lay of the sun or what, we figured out we are going west. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The relief, I mean they are not taking us to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> where they are shooting them and burying them in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And we left on Monday the 15th and during the night on the 15th and it had to be on the 17th, we arrive at a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in the middle of the night and from the cracks we could see out, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , which was in <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So it was, why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We did not know anything, we had no idea what was going on or where or why and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stands there and then it's being shuttled from one <span class="DLF">track</span> to another <span class="DLF">track</span> , to another <span class="DLF">track</span> , to another <span class="DLF">track</span> and shuttled back and what was front is now moving back. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">In the morning we end up someplace and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stops and there's no more movement and I should add this, that the ride and the thirst, without water, the crowding, the people crowded together, squeezed together, you couldn't lie down, you could only sit on your haunches and people more or less urinating in front of each other, defecating in front of each other, the smell, horrible feeling, it just, kids crying and little ones and I was in the middle of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with a woman, I don't know maybe in the forties and she didn't have a nose, just horrible looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I asked my father what it was, he said she had TB of the nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">A horrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So we are at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , at an unknown <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is stopped there and there's no more movement and we don't know where we are and then the sun is coming up and daylight and the <span class="DLF">train gates</span> are being opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  Did you have any conversations with your parents durig this ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  About what? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Nothing, I mean there was nothing to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It was just, everybody was just like, either a quandary or whatever, hard to explain it, it was just, nobody knew where we were going, nobody knew what's going to happen to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  Were there people that were hysterical or crying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  No, well people were crying from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It was a horrible situation, the total unknown, the total uncertainty. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It's going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> from where nobody came back, so we never knew about this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We knew about the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> because there were people there who did not belong there, who had no business being there or had no business seeing those things and who had a big mouth and who saw things which they just couldn't keep to themselves, because things like that are just hair-raising things and they had to tell somebody, but from where we were going there was nobody ever came back to tell anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So we did not know where we were and finally when they open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and people come, people who were opening the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were 1n prison uniforms, the striped uniforms which was immediately a bad, call it an omen or a bad sign or a bad foreboding or whatever and he says, everybody get out and unlike in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> where they had a plank for the people to be driven up into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , here was like in a <span class="BUILDING">civilian station</span> , the <span class="DLF">platform</span> was on the level of the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , so that could just step out of it, you didn't have to jump down, you didn't have to climb down, just get out of 1t and he says, leave everything behind and get out and this guy in the prison uniform comes into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and starts talking, does anybody have any money, anybody have any jewelry? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Money, jewelry, they took 1t away from us long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Says, you have any medicine? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Give him the morphine, he grabs it, shoves it under his jacket, it's gone, instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So I said to myself, at least we did some good and then he starts, he says, you, points at me, says how old are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So I said 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Mm-mm, you're 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He looks at my brother, how old is he? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He's not quite 13, he's 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Oh-oh, he's 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Said 18, we can't say 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And then I say(s), why? " </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Freg nish kein Shayles", which means in Yiddish, don't ask any (difficult) questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And then he says, we start talking to him and all this goes on in seconds, in seconds. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Where are you from he said, we ask him. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He's from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">A Polish Jew I said to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">All we heard is that they killed them all and here is one alive, so I felt like saying it to him, but I had enough sense not to say such a stupid thing, say we heard that all the Polish Jews were killed, I didn't say it but anyway he already got us wise to this, that something is going to happen to the younger ones, that it's, we have to lie about our age and where are we? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He says, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , where is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , nobody knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">We says, what is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">That we knew, that we knew from way, way back, I mean from when the Germans had their first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> 1934 we knew about them already. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was a dreaded word, it was a word not spoken anywhere in Europe, not even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the civilians dreaded that word, the Germans themselves, as I found out after the war, they called in "Katset", which was the letters KZ, as the Germans pronounced it and it was just, and what here? </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He says, you'll find out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Your father was having this conversation ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yeah and he says, you'll find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And so we got out and everybody out and he says leave everything behind, leave everything behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Says those are our things. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Leave everything behind, get out, get out, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And from every one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> there may have been, as I said I couldn't count them, there may have been 12 maybe, 15 maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">1000 people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And then within seconds somebody passes the word, women on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , men on that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So instantly we were separated from our mother and everybody was separated, his wife, his mother and sisters and all that and busy here, busy there and next thing I know, I 03:40 don't see here any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And eventually we get up, the group of men and there's an SS officer in front and starts looking over everybody and says how old are you and so we said 18 and I didn't feel like going as far as 19, I just didn't have the nerve and how old is he and so we said 17 and then again sorting, old people here, all people with children there and old men here and old men there and next thing you know we are separate and then the other thing was that as soon as I stepped out I looked around, I saw that <span class="NPIP">place</span> is ominous, whereas in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> they had a three foot high wooden plank fence and wooden towers, here they had <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> as <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , permanents, there was no temporariness about this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the fence posts were solid concrete and all identical and you could look down along them and they ran like into infinity and into infinity there. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And from this <span class="DLF">platform</span> I could see <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and they run all like <span class="DLF">lines</span> and <span class="DLF">lines</span> and <span class="DLF">lines</span> and <span class="DLF">lines</span> and there were, all of them were black and huge and as far as the eye could see, there was no end to them and then I could see there's more of these <span class="BUILDING">guard buildings</span> , I would say <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> but they were regular <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> made from like cinder blocks with <span class="DLF">windows</span> and solid. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And then we were being marched and standing on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">To the left of the <span class="DLF">road</span> is this <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> with the concrete poles and signs that it's electrified and on every pole there were insulators, electric insulators, which I knew what they were, I wasn't that simple and I knew that wire passing through an insulator had high voltage in it and there were signs in addition if you didn't know it, there were signs saying that high voltage and Lebensgefahr, dangerous to life. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And across the barbed wire was a grassy, wooded knoll and there were the older people and there were the, some Rabbi's and they had on their praying shawls and they were praying and they had an idea what's going to happen to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Were they people that had been on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , were you with your father at this point and your brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">03:43
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And as we are standing there along this, on this <span class="DLF">road</span> , what was left of us after the sorting and the selection, as I said, there may have been, can't possibly tell the right figure, I mean it may have been 60, it may have been 80, 1t may have been 100 that was left all the work, all the men capable of work and many of us were kids like my age and my brother's and suddenly, out of nowhere, SS appeared in helmets and with submachine guns on both side of our column and one of them goes towards my brother, how old are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So my father panics and I panic, so I told him 17 or whatever we said, maybe we said 14, 15, anything, just more than what he was, he wasn't even 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And he says, you're sure? </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And he told me, oh yeah, my father said, he spoke French, the SS officer let him pass through. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So the SS reluctantly gave up on it, then my father says, would you mind switching with him, to another person in our <span class="DLF">line</span> , there were like five of us in <span class="DLF">line</span> , says, no way, I don't want to be at the edge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  I don't understand this ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  It was another, what it was, another Jew from the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was, my father tried to get the kid, my kid brother to get inside the column so he wouldn't be sticking out at the edge, so he wouldn't be so noticeable, but everybody was looking out for his own life and his own skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And then they marched us in, we were standing there in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and take off everything and we're just standing there and this was just separated from the —s bya <span class="DLF">fence</span> , <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> , over which they threw blankets to block out the view.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  But ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, we didn't know it was a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> but somehow, at some point, somebody said to us what's happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The ones at the <span class="BUILDING">arrival place</span> were risking their life for every word they told us and for me this was not completely new. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">On one of those broadcasts from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , they were talking about civilian laborers who went to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and the Germans used them until they were 03:46 completely used up, totally worn out from the hard work and they told them that they are going to send them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for recreation and they took them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was, looked like a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and once they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , they dropped the gas bomb in and they killed them all and then they burnt them. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So, in other words, this was not completely new. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">On one of those broadcasts from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , they were talking about civilian laborers who went to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and the Germans used them until they were completely used up, totally worn out from the hard work and they told them that they are going to send them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for recreation and they took them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was, looked like a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and once they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , they dropped the gas bomb in and they killed them all and then they burnt them. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So, in other words, I heard this from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , but the scenario was different, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was different and as I found out, as we knew, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was lying on many occasions and they were trying to discourage Hungarian Christians from going to work as volunteers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And so, once somebody mentioned <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , I knew the whole story, I mean I knew where, what it's about and then we were standing in this <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and just standing there naked and standing and standing and waiting and then come in two prisoners with numbers tattoos on their forearms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Some prisoners came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And they set up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">portable table</span> and they have cards and they start taking our names and filling out the name, date of birth and by then we already were programmed that, I was born 1n '28, not '29 and Robbie was born in '30 and not '31. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I just didn't have the nerve to lie more than one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And so we start asking them questions, we were bombarding them, they were the first humans <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , I said, so what happened to the whole people, what happened to the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">See those flames there? </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Flames going up there now? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">That's where they are, they're going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And people from let's say my outfit or my trainload, they just wouldn't, couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So, and I says to them, what about these numbers, everybody gets numbers, when are we going to get numbers? </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And these were the clerks. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And most of their answers were like either I don't know or an equivalent I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Then, where are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="566">They said they were from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">How long you been here? </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I don't know, a year or two years, whatever they say, but we got very little intelligence from them and what we did get, they wouldn't believe, they didn't want to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So, eventually they let us keep our shoes and they let us keep belts, belts or suspenders and they eventually sent us to a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , which was a real <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and gave us prison clothes, rags for shorts and rags for shirts and marched us into one of those <span class="BUILDING">storage buildings</span> , couldn't call them <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they didn't have any <span class="DLF">windows</span> , no nothing, they were like storage and 1n it there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">storage bins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So there were three stories, into each bin, 10 people, 10 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Oh and they cut us, our hair, the grownups they were shaved the chest, they shaved the back, they shaved the pubic areas or clipped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So there we were and put up or go to sleep there and every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> got thrown or bin got thrown a blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">The next morning the head counts and formation and all day and standing there all day, and first contact with other prisoners, come in a bunch of young, well dressed, Polish prisoners, with the armband, black armband with the white letters or white armband with black letters saying Kapo and weird people and to me at 15, the whole thing looked absurd, I mean here was a man who, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , who I got frisked of everything, I could keep my suspenders and my shoes and here he had quite a large, a chronometer, which I only saw in a <span class="DLF">jewelers shop window</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I've never seen a watch like that on a person in civilian ever in all my days. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And here he was sporting one of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And his prison uniform, I could tell, I mean to me I could tell, was custom made. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">A lousy, God damn striped uniform, but tailored to his shape, to his body. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And since he couldn't have a white shirt, nobody could have a white shirt in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> he had a white bib under the striped jacket so it looked like he had a white shirt on. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I mean, the mentality of these people and there were like three or four of these and they were Polish, we asked them what they were and they were Poles and they were Christians and they were coming with shoes and a loaf of bread because they were looking at our shoes, if they were any good, says, I trade you these and a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">In other words they were looting us while we were still alive and our, maybe 10 years ago I got hold of a book called Fighting Auschwitz, which was written by, I think Arlinski(ph), a Polish man, maybe he was there himself and he was just going on and on and on about resistance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and underground and resistance and how they were connected and how everything was and how they were involved in everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So when I saw this I says to myself, oh we were not visited by Kapo, we were contacted by the resistance, by the camp resistance, these were not Polish robbers, they were Polish resistance people. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So I just, there was a scene which I won't forget ever and which I'll hold against the good old Polacks forever and they managed to get some shoes, so again, being a wise guy I asked the guy, young fellow, why did you give him your shoes, were you that hungry, were you that much in need of that loaf of bread? </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Is that going to make a difference to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Says, well they told us that they was going to take it away anyway, they're going to take away our shoes anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So most of us told him then, gave him the answer, he says, will they take it away? </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Until they take it away, I'll have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I'm not trading with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And they were asking us for news from the outside world and we told them they took away our radios a month and a half ago and we didn't know anything what's going on and until then what we knew, the news was not that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The Soviets, the Red Army is just barely touching <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , they're nowhere anywhere near. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So and we were in formation there all day, just standing there and standing there and standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">There were space between the, these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> or <span class="BUILDING">sheds</span> or <span class="BUILDING">storage buildings</span> and in the morning they counted us, an SS counted us and in the evening they counted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Now it was very important how many there are. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">By the way, it didn't matter to anybody if there were 88 of us in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> when we arrived and I just couldn't understand them because it was so important that 88 people should be in it, that nobody should escape and here it didn't matter any more, no not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">It was just one absurd thing after another, it was like a world completely topsy-turvy, it was just. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And when we were standing there naked, waiting to be processed or whatever, the women run by naked, screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">The same, our women who got separated from us and who didn't have children and who were selected for labor, but my mother told me many a year later, she says, I saw you, but I was naked and you were naked so I wouldn't say anything, ——_?_</span><span class="sentence" id="598">~ or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then eventually an SS who was processing them and who was chasing them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , he pulled down the curtains for them so they wouldn't have to be there, exposed, naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Which again, so unlike an SS, that he had some consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  So for the record how long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> _? </span><span class="sentence" id="602">03:56
ANSWER:  Well, let me get to this, we were standing 1n the formation all day, orin__, we were just standing in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and talking and circling, but for the head count we had to stay in formation and then one day, maybe by Saturday, we had got there on Thursday the 18th and suddenly they said, everybody under 18 on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , everybody over 18 on that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, no mixing, don't you try to cross <span class="DLF">lines</span> , don't you try to cross over. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So, got separated from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Next morning, they take the ones over 18, we didn't know where, what. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">In the evening they bring them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So they took them away for some work for somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There was no way we could get to them, ask them where they were, what they did or anything, because by then already, even in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> it was divided, you on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , you one that <span class="NPIP">side</span> and don't you dare cross over. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And then on Sunday the 21st, they count off again, the over 18's and they march them off and I don't know, some hours later, another batch moved in in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> and that was the last time I saw my father, just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And while we were there, transports keep coming every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Let's say, people from our <span class="INT_SPACE">unit</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to pick up food for us and barrels and that was always a way of communicating. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">If they ran into somebody from another <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , where are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungvar</span> [now called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uzgorod</span> ], so we knew already that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungvar</span> is being shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  And that's my father says, my poor mother, that she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungvar</span> and that she might be in there, into the <span class="BUILDING">Krema</span> , I mean the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and the .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Okay, this time, I'll get the ; End of Tape #3 Tape #4
QUESTION:  Remind us again, how long you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  We arrived there on Thursday, the 18th and we stayed there until Friday, which was the 26th, I believe and during that time we were like, my brother and me among total strangers or since, I didn't mention before that by being rushed to this Shyowitz(ph) brick factory, I got into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which was like 99 percent people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were brought in, so I did not know anybody there and they didn't know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">There were very few people actually from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> itself on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So, as my father's group got moved out, others moved in, then somebody else got again moved out, so it was rotation and mixing and all that and then on Friday they emptied our entire <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they marched us to the same <span class="DLF">railroad platform</span> or <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where we were unloaded except now we were on the other side of it, there were three <span class="DLF">tracks</span> there and we came in on the, facing outward on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and now we were lining up on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and in front of us was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and again we were just standing in front of them and this time they were counting 50 of us in prison uniforms into each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and they gave us bread and water for the trip and the guards this time were soldiers like I've never seen before either in life or in pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They were what the Germans call Marine Soldaten, in other words like marine soldiers, but they were older and we were very glad that they were not SS because we just feared the SS very much, we knew them from reputation, what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And we saw them, what they did in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> too, it was real bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So anyway, you think that getting into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> only 50 of us would be a little more spacious, whereas compared to 88, but it wasn't, because the guards decided to divide, well they didn't decide it, but it worked out that that was the arrangement, the guards were in the middle, they had one-third of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to the two guards and one third to 25 prisoners and the other third to 25 prisoners, so you can figure out the, and we were sitting again, all pulled up on our haunches and as it was getting dark at night, we started finally inching out our legs to see if the guards will react or if they're going to let us stretch out a little bit and they did let us stretch out and as soon as it was daylight, started yelling and, get back, get back and so we had to pull back and again crowd into each other's stomachs and against each other and just sit there and sit and sit and on late Saturday night, somewhere on Saturday, we arrived again 04:05 someplace and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and next morning they opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and now SS men, wild looking SS get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , the Marine Soldaten are going away and these are young, vicious looking ones, with submachine guns on the shoulder, not rifles like the Marine Soldaten had, these are armed for close shooting and making a massacre of anything if there's any trouble and I knew what those kind of weapons were, that's all, maybe somebody else didn't, but I knew what they could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And eventually they unload us, everybody out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and then I see on the <span class="BUILDING">stationhouse</span> there's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Again I use some mnemonic device to memorize that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">It was seed distributor in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and it was called Mautner and everybody knew the Mautner seeds and they were in existence for generations, so Maut and hausen like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muenchhausen</span> or something, so could remember that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And then they started marching us and it's a long march on pebbly <span class="DLF">roads</span> and <span class="DLF">secondary roads</span> and first through a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and then through a <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and <span class="DLF">roads</span> and turned out that, I found this out already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that my brother had a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the sole of his shoe and while we were waiting to be loaded onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I saw piles of empty cartons or cases from lamps, light bulbs, which, they were always changing the light bulbs 1n the <span class="DLF">electric fence</span> , the lighting so nothing would ever burn out or get disconnected or something, but and there were piles of these so I put some of those in my pocket for future use and to put my margarine into it and so I stuffed several of those into my brother's shoe so there would be something between the pebbles of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the sharp stones and his feet, but 1t didn't help much and he was just in pain and crying and he was hot, it was warm, very bright sun and we were thirsty and it was a long march and hard and SS on both sides and yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So finally we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Mauthausen</span> , which was a very, I don't know, forbidding looking <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the whole, the <span class="DLF">walls</span> again, they're not temporary, they were made, built from granite stone and they were like maybe two and a half meters high or three meters high and on the top of the <span class="DLF">stone fence</span> there were strips of barb wire again, like maybe five strips and again with the insulators to let you know that they were electrified and it took the better part of a day to get processed there and again somebody came, a German prisoner and picked out the younger ones and you go, you stay over here and among those was my brother and I tried to yank him back to the group where I was and the guy spotted it and he pulled him out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And then I tried to go, I tried to sneak into that group and he spotted me and pulled me back and I tried one more time and he said, you try it one more time and you'll get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So that was the last time I saw my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And the other thing I was curious about, they were doing <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , we were taking into the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , which was underground at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">stone building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I was very curious to see if anybody's coming out of those <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> or if those are the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> type showers. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I didn't want to go in, I was waiting, again it was odd that they should have taken us that far by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> just to kill us now, but at this point there were so many inconsistencies and so many irrational, one thing after another, that I wasn't sure any more about anything and when I saw them coming out I went in and then the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> could hold, I guess maybe 25-30 people, it was not a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> like some <span class="NPIP">places</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had for example, or some others. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And they were yelling and somehow I managed to stay through two or three showerings, you know, was new groups came in and others went out and I was mixed in with the rest and I enjoyed the hot water and when I came out, our shoes were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">They were good shoes, so a fellow, brother Jew stole them and left in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> their worn out, horrible pair. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Made a good deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And then some of us were taken together and marched into a separate <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , which was separated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> again by this very high <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> and the barbed wire on top of it and we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we were sleeping on maybe straw sacks on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they were lining us up like sardines, head to foot, head to foot and squeezing, there were 500 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And we were in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> a whole week, or let's say from Sunday until Friday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">On Friday afternoon, they marched us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and loaded us, not into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , but into a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civilian train</span> , which again, I never met anybody who was taken anywhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I mean a prisoner, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civilian train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And this was one of those where every <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> had a <span class="DLF">door</span> opening to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which we are used to in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , had a <span class="DLF">corridor</span> from which the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> opened in to and one SS gets into each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he says, nobody move because I'm going to shoot without warning. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And we're sitting like five across the wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> , like normal civilians, unbelievable, no crowding, nobody sitting on top of anybody else and you can sit and he said sit at attention and don't try to move, don't talk and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and stayed there in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> for a long time and then got going again and we arrived at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> it said Ebensee(ph), again I never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) today before, never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And they unload us, again, new SS get on, pick us up, take over and march us a good distance into, up <span class="DLF">hill</span> into another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We get into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it's like virtually hidden in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> are surrounded by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and there are cut down trees tossed on the tops of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> , to conceal them further. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And just enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> 4:14 cut down for the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on either side, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> all around and again processing and sorting and you go here and the two men with whom I became friendly or one man with whom I became friendly a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , we stayed together somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And he was an attorney in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> and was a very nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And again that was fortunate for me that I met him and that he was that nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And after sorting and being checked by an SS doctor, again undressed naked and a floodlight on you to see what shape you are in and he picked out I don't know how many of us and we got assigned to one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We find out when we are there that we are working in <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> on a rotating shift and eight hour shift and our shift happened to start on Sunday night at 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So it would be from 11 until 7 in the morning working in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And tunnel work was, we had no idea what it's for or what weird looking thing, a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and into it are cut <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , one after another, like maybe seven or eight <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and they told us, you are working in <span class="DLF">tunnel seven</span> , remember that and the outfit for which you are working is Holtzmann-Polanski(ph) and those same firms are still existing in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  , these were tall <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Tall <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  Large enough to...
ANSWER:  Hold a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And we go in there and there are scaffoldings inside the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and on the scaffoldings are drills, pneumatic drills with the hammers and power drills, I mean with the brrrrr and compressed air is blowing through the <span class="DLF">pipes</span> , there is pipes like this in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , along the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , pumping in <span class="DLF">air</span> , pumping power for the drills and then the <span class="DLF">drill holes</span> for the dynamite, for blasting and the German civilian sends everybody out from the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and sets up the dynamite and blasts it and then after everything is clear, then he checks the blast and we go back in and pick out the, load all the broken rock onto narrow gauge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> and push them out and pick up the rails and extend them further into the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , deeper and deeper and there's one section of 04:17 the rail which is a switching point where there are two tracks and you can switch from one track to another and that weighed a ton, 1t was steel and it was grabbing all around it and lifting it up and as always in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , nobody was, somebody was always getting out from carrying his load, so the next one carried twice as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">That was the hardest part in it and the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> was cold and damp and the water was coming in between the rocks at some <span class="NPIP">places</span> and it was night and noise and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I worked there for a week and a new transport of Jews came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) and they got picked through and I got out of that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I got to a day time job and others got assigned to the night time shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So another 500 transported, 500. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And so I did all kinds of work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) and when we come back in the evening from the work, there's a command yelling out, all Jews out, in other words in the evening they used to have head counts and in the morning the head counts and the formations standing and standing until everybody got counted and after everybody was counted then we could go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and get supper, or a loaf of bread, I mean a section of bread and some margarine or something, whatever came with it, you know, sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And then this time, all Jews out, stay on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and you're not going back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and suddenly we are surrounded by what I call the beaters, these were the way some people earn their living by being barbers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or being block chiefs, these are, earn their living by beating other prisoners and turned out that there was a huge pile or several huge piles of pre-fabricated barracks sections and we were supposed to take those sections and carry them on our shoulders to the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where a new <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> would be built. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And these sections weighed a ton and they were beating us with heavy hoses and sticks until we picked it up, like they used to beat horses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> until they started pulling their load, they beat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And again the same thing, the little guy up front made like he's carrying, but he was walking under it, fellow Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And then when we got near his <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , he just bolted and dashed away and the rest of us got for sure stuck with a whole section of that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And then some of these sections had holes in them for <span class="DLF">windows</span> , so again it was impossible to carry the even load, one section was heavy as a ton and the other ones was just a frame of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and as it turned out, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was supposed, turned out to be later on, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So just again coincidence and irony or whatever you want to call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> was it majority Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  No, that was another thing, let me get to that, we were the first Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> who were kept for labor, who were not killed within three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Up to that point, all Jews who reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> were murdered within three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">If they were not dead by the third day, the SS started to make jokes at them, he says, you like it here, how come you're still alive, this <span class="NPIP">place</span> agrees with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">This I only find out later, but anyway, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was full of all kinds of nationalities, there were at that time when we arrived there, maybe 5500, there were Russian POW's, Soviet Red Army POW's, there were Polish civilians, Russian civilians, there were Frenchmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There was a handful of Spaniards from the civil war, who the Germans captured somehow, one way or another from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> turned them over to the Germans and there were Italians and there were a handful of Czechs and maybe one or two Greeks and that was it, so we were the first Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> [not correct] and the first Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) and getting back to these building sections, when we finally reached the bottom one, under it was snow, in the middle of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">In other words, these shipments arrived in the winter, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) was being, they started building 1t in November '43, we got there on the second of June and these piles of sections, of pre-fabricated sections were there since November or December and the winters were such that there was still snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> across from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) when we got there and it was not until July or August when it finally melted, so it was a cool <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And one thing I definitely want to mention is the stealing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , stealing of the food by the ones who distributed it and the stealing of the food by fellow prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I would say the Jews were probably, if not the worst, very close to it as far as stealing. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">My bread got stolen many times until (finally ?) </span><span class="sentence" id="676">and I cried and some of the other fellows told me, he said look, it's not such a big piece of bread that you couldn't eat it in one sitting, so why don't you eat it in the evening as soon as you get it and that way it will be in your stomach and not in somebody else's. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So I finally learned my lesson, from then on I did it that way, but there again was one so called good advice from my father, always save some for the next day, which in this case, like so many other of his advices turned out to be not quite suitable for the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">It Just was not that type of a world and as far as stealing by the chiefs, it was like this, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> they knew for each <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , how many prisoners were in each <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they filled the, I don't know what you want to call it, the containers that, some of them could hold 25 liters, some of them could hold 50 liters and they filled them accordingly so everybody would get one liter of soup and the soup was mostly vegetables, but were vegetables, it's not like green beans and stuff like that, there was turnips beets and related things. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Occasionally you were lucky if you find a small, found a small piece of potato and sometimes, very rarely, you found some piece of meat in there, but very rarely. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And anyway, there was, in addition to the number of liters, they always gave some extra for the chiefs in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , so they would have more food than the peons or ordinary prisoners, but it was not enough for them, the extra what was being shipped to them, they used to, first of all, as soon as the containers arrived, the block chief went in with the ladle and got from the bottom of it, where the good stuff settled and gave one for myself, one for you, one for the clerk and one for the Kapo and one for this and take them <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And then he says, oh here's one more for this one and one more for that one and then he started ladling out and then he stirred it up a little bit, what was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So what we were getting was already thinner, because he picked out the best from the bottom and then again, he watched your face and if he liked you, he dipped into the bottom and he gave you that way, if he didn't like you, he just put in from top and you got broth or you got very few floating vegetables or something like that and it was just, every bite meant a lot and you were being robbed by this one, you were being robbed by that one and it was just a very, very bad world and a very bad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And one of the things with the shoe, when I got the bad shoe, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ), we got assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> right away, happened to be a friendly Polish guy there, a young one, who did not have a prison uniform tailored to his body and was just a regular prison jacket, but he had a black cap, which was another sign of rank, which they all loved to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I don't know how they managed to get them, or where they got them, but anybody with any rank has to have a black cap, a black hat with a visor. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So he said, you need shoe, I'll get you a shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So he gave me a wooden shoe, I mean a shoe with a wooden sole and kind of strong, I don't know what you want to call it, plastic material or something on the top and I don't know at which point I got them, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> where I got a pair of foot rags to wear inside the shoes and we all had those in place of socks, nobody had socks, we had rags, you wrapped your feet in rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And these shoes which he gave me were lined with felt and I thought the felt would be good enough, I wouldn't have to need the rags and I wore them that way and they started rubbing against my skin and they abraded the skin and it wouldn't heal and it just kept opened and opened and wound and finally found out that there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> and I went there and I got it bandaged, the bandage was crepe paper and the cleaning was with peroxide, they just sloshed it with peroxide and I don't know if they put any ointment on it at all but they wrapped it up in the white crepe and that was it, off you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And then I found out that if the wound is bad enough that you might get a day off from work, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> rest, they let you stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and I learned all tricks as much as I could, I mean I kept my eyes opened and my ears opened because otherwise my father said I was not survival material and I was trying to, I wasn't trying to prove him wrong, I was just trying to get by. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And find out as many tricks as I could use to get by. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So one day I did get a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> rest and one day while I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I see somebody with diarrhea and they shove him a pan and tell him prove it, so he goes in to the pan and fine, you go into the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> , stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So again, it was chance, in some cases, people who had diarrhea were killed, were beaten to death, in some cases they got admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , so it was all kinds of inconsistencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Who are you running to, when, what time of the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Going on a sick leave, 1t was a murder, I mean there was a guard there who was beating the sick ones and there was, you had maybe five minutes to get in there or something like that and then before you had to get back into formation. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And anyway, I did get diarrhea and I did get into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and surprisingly they had good food for the ones with the diarrhea, I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I managed to stay in there, like one way or another I managed to stay in there like eight or nine days, which was a fantastic break. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I didn't 04:31 have to work, the wound healed by itself from not being abraded all day and from getting a slightly different food and from being at rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And then I got back to the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where I was before and we were all working in all kinds of different units and one unit and this and that and the next day in a different unit and some, what we considered best was working inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because then we didn't have to march a long march out to the <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> and a long march back to the <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> and we could go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and get our food, and the the soup at noon in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , which again was folly, because the ones who worked out there were distributed by different people who were not as greedy as the block chief and was more equitably distributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So I'm working out in the big <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> where the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> were, but outside the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and we were shoveling gravel from where the gravel crusher is tossing it and from there it's being loaded, spread out all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so the whole worksite will be covered with it and dust, stone dust all over and this was in maybe August. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I have it written down, but I didn't memorize the date and the white dust is falling all over and the boys are in a good mood, because the job is easy and there were no close supervision. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">The Kapo was not nearby, the SS wasn't nearby and they are all talking and by that time I had a very bad reputation that I'll eat anything, that I'll eat breadcrumbs from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , that I'll eat potato peelings which others throw away and only that I'm just a pig and I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> and when I come back, we all had our soup bowls with us, we always carried the soup bowl and the spoon which was assigned to us, which we kept and they tell me that a civilian was there and gave them a milk soup and would I like it? </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I said, why didn't you eat it, they said, well we ate already and we left some for you, so I was kind of leery about it, but I start eating, being like I said a pig and greedy and all out for any bite of food and it doesn't taste right to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And I had put away maybe four or five tablespoons of it and it just doesn't taste right and finally one of them opened his mouth, pitch it, throw it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">It turned out they got the white dust from the rocks and they poured water into it and they told me it's a milk soup for __, well it's <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so it doesn't taste like the home milk soup we had at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we used to make it from sour cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Sure enough I got the diarrhea again. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They said, you're not going to be a sissy and go in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> again, are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I said, yes I am and I went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I told them I got the diarrhea, said prove it, I had no trouble proving it and in you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And I'm back again and says, you back again? </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I said, yeah I'm back again, I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So, and this time the food was not quite as good as before but it was still good. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Still better than <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I still had rest, I was still lying 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the only time I had to sit up was for the head count and again, like eight or nine days, I say it was like an extension on my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And when I came back they all were deriding me, I wouldn't call teasing, 1t was much worse than teasing and heckling me and stuff like that, that you are a sissy and this and that and solidarity 1s what I call it, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  What ever happened to the lawyer from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  He was in, he stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with the <span class="DLF">night tunnel</span> , with the rotating shifts and I was able to see him on, sometimes when he was off work and on weekends, I mean weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We worked 13 days out of 14 and we had one rest Sunday, every two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So sometimes I just didn't get to his <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I couldn't go 1t because we were not permitted to go into <span class="BUILDING">foreign barracks</span> which were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I could send in word by somebody, please ask Kish(ph) Montsy(ph) or Doctor Kish(ph) to come out, I would like to see him and then we could, we had contact that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  And he was nice to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  One of those times when my bread got stolen, he gave me some of his, which was a rare thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I mean there were times, not many times I mean, I used to think to myself, I wish I had a father like him, I wish I had a father like him, that's how he was to me, he was kind and he was, he always had the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Somehow where he worked, there were civilians and somehow those civilians were not unfriendly and somehow they all read the Nazi paper, which was Voelkischer Beobachter, but even the Voekischer Beobachter, like I told you, you could read between the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , I mean there are, we knew within a day from when the allies landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I knew where the front was when I'm working the <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were opened and one of the SS had a map on his <span class="DLF">wall</span> , which he took from the newspaper on which was the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So I knew that the promised always we shall push them back into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , they did not push them back in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> because the red <span class="DLF">line</span> was in <span class="REGION">northern France</span> and I knew that maps. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So one way or another, Montsy(ph)Basci, I called him Uncle Montsy(ph) was always a source of news and we knew when, how far they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , how far this or that, 1t was very slow going, for us it was a hundred times too slow, but it was hope, somehow and the news meant an awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I met a Czech medic who was also very nice and I would say that guy too, had an influence on me for the rest of my days, I mean that guy could laugh and joke in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the middle of death, like and again that meant something which I didn't grow up with that, there was no joking in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in my father's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there was nothing to be happy about or stuff like and this guy like, I would say, had that influence on me, but I can laugh at things and I can make jokes out of things and comes in a kid and he had dog bites, somebody sent a dog on him and come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and just happens at that time, I come into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a swollen eye, because we took shelter in a <span class="DLF">dugout</span> for an SS guard, from the rain, I mean shelter from the rain in an SS guard's <span class="DLF">dugout</span> and the chief, the Lager Fuehrer came by in his rain poncho, what are you doing down there and the whole work unit was down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Get out of there this second and he had always with him a whip and he was hitting as we were coming out and I happened to catch it across the eye, so happened to be in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at there, in the evening after work and they said, oh you must have done something bad that you got that whip across your eye and that wasn't too funny, but still, I mean he was trying to do whatever to cheer you up somehow and take your mind off the things and so every one of those little things meant, it was out of proportion to what it was in value. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I mean it's value was out of proportion to the one single word which was uttered it meant, just morale, for the morale and for, in a sense you could feel, you could lean on that word or something, it's hard to put it into words, hard to really describe it, but I think I'm coming close......
QUESTION:  He would sustain you ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  You needed every drop, every, every, like in civilian life here you say a petting or love stroke or whatever you want to call it and over there it mean tremendous much. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And I mentioned the dog, dog bites. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">The Germans had dogs for guard duty and sometimes if somebody wasn't moving fast enough on the <span class="DLF">work site</span> or if the German was in the right mood, he just gave the command to the dog and the dog flew like a missile and with one blow, the dog hit a prisoner, the prisoner was already on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Once, I saw this and then the dog went at him and just from side to side like a rag, was pulling him, yanking him, biting him, chewing, tearing him, it was like a kid would pick a rag and just play with it and yank it and toss it and, but the malice and everything, there were Dobermans and Wolfhounds, I mean German Shepherds and...
QUESTION:  Did the dogs kill people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  They could. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I haven't seen it happen, but it could be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  I have read that the treatment at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> was especially sadistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  This was him, the one who hit me with the whip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  He killed some prisoners one night...
ANSWER:  No, that was another one, the one before him, the previous one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  But you heard about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  No, not until I was, years after the war I heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">They got drunk and he and another SS or two other SS men and a work detail was returning from work and they just pulled out their pistols and started shooting into them and they were all written up as having died in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But this one was a, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> work was in his blood, I mean he was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard from the year maybe and, this too I only found out when I read his write up or biography, which I obtained from, of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , from that archives which they have there and that was maybe in '37 already was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And then he was at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and as he moved, each time he got higher and he knew the ways how to handle the stuff and he was tough on the guards and 10 times as tough on the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So by the time he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span> ) he was the Lager commandant or Lager Fuehrer as they called him and he was maybe a captain, Haupt Sturm Fuehrer, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And as far as brutality, the brutality was the beaters, the prisoners themselves, who were there to do the beating and again there was one incident which, once I was in a fairly decent work detail, I mean, everything was chance and luck and if you tried to get into that again, sometimes you get pulled out of 1t and what --?, </span><span class="sentence" id="742">so this work detail was working near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , near the <span class="BUILDING">Krema</span> [<span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ] on the other side of the <span class="DLF">wire fence</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> had it's own Krema after a while and we were digging huge <span class="DLF">pits</span> 04:45 for storing potatoes and beets for the winter and the SS who was in charge was probably a farmer in civilian and he was not so young, he may have been, I don't know, in the 40's and he was not particularly mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And the couple who was in charge of the work detail was a German, a redhead, freckled, with a horribly low number. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">You knew that he was there an extremely long time, like I had a number 68,308 and the next 500 Jews came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> , they were already 70 thousanders. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Two weeks later there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , they were already 72,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">In October came the Poles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , who were captured during the Polish uprising, or crushed out, when it was crushed, they already had number 93,000 or 98,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So when somebody has a number with four digits, he was there a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Then they started bringing the potatoes for those <span class="DLF">pits</span> and we were pouring them in and as we put, we store one here or one there and there all potatoes, they bring them in to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the evening after work and sort of snuggle to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , everybody was crowding around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and put them on the top and bake them or burn them or whatever, so they wouldn't be raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And one evening, this must have been in late November, it was dark already and we are coming back from work and at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> we are counted and the SS is relieved and the <span class="DLF">gate</span> is being opened and the SS around are watching that everybody goes in and ahead of us 1s standing another work detail and they are being frisked one by one by one, by a row of maybe four or five SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">They are just going through everybody for anything, I mean bringing in an empty paper bag was sabotage and punishable be a good beating, plenty beating and when we saw what's coming, we started reaching in for our potatoes, into the pockets and hiding them and where will we put them, but we were in the flood lens and the SS who were searching the ones in front of us said, oh, they are tossing away the potatoes already, don't even bother searching them, in they go as soon as they cross the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , 10 for everybody, 10 whips or 10 lashes, including the Kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So as soon as we get in, the beaters grab us and they have there these huge barrels, just for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">They grab you, toss you onto the barrel with the face down and beat on the rear with sticks and rubber hoses. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And I was screaming because he wasn't hitting my rear, he was hitting my coccyx and when we all got our beatings, the couple was still standing by and he says, if you want to come by to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> after supper, we'll just have a little get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So, and this other guy who was in my work unit, from my own <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , a Jewish guy, a tall one, says to me, why were you yelling? </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Said because he was hitting in my bone instead of my tail. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Well did it do you any good to yell, said why yell? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So about five of us Jewish kids or 10 from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> , after supper, we went to his <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and it was Kapos only in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And he told them to let us in and that was a completely different class, I mean the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were painted, I mean, many <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had whitewashed walls, but this one was homey looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And they had all kinds of things and we were standing around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> , I mean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , it was just the camaraderie on part of this Kapo, what I would call the fellowship of the beaten ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Again he was unique, he was remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And he had a, it was a pink triangle, which was, the Germans trusted criminals and German criminals and even pink triangles over any other foreigners and if you were German, you were 10 foot higher than a Polish prisoner or a French prisoner and you could be trusted to be assigned as a Kapo or a block chief or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And on one of those mornings when we were marching out, we were going by the <span class="DLF">perimeter fence</span> and on it was a person hanging, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Either tossed on it, or jumped on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We never knew, when somebody was dead, if somebody killed him, or if he committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">There was a man in my transport of 500 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">In other words, some of us were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> , some were from hungary, some were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and as things got, they got mixed, sort of and this guy, I don't know what he was, he may have been an attorney and he was very intellectual and he looked down on everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I mean a prisoner, but everybody to him was dirt compared to him and then he was king, King Shit, in plain English. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> , within one day we have, one evening we come back from work and there is the head count, Appell as they called it and one is missing and whenever one was missing, there was circus, everybody had to stand, remain standing, all formation and it was, it should have been so easy to find who was missing because every <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had a book on which the clerk wrote how many hour in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, and the SS counted them already, how many were and checked off that yeah, there were so many, so one of them didn't count properly and he should have known which was. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So anyway, a recounting again, this time for sure and checking the numbers and they found which <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> is one shy, so beaters, Kapos, everybody, go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , into the camp area, this was a, the head count was in a square, like a <span class="DLF">plaza</span> , which was open and the camp was, I mean it was to one side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And they go through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , first of all go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where he is supposed to be and he's not there, so go all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , maybe he's hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , hiding here, hiding there, we'll beat all over with the sticks, look for, so finally they come back laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">The Jew was hanging on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So he says, next time one of you Jews decides to kill himself, let us know in advance so we won't have to do all this searching and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So for long months after that, I always said to myself, that man was a smart man, he was the only one with brains among us that he killed himself on the first week, before he went through so much suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">But, and that's how it entered in the book, in the register that he was, he committed suicide or something like that, they had funny words for everything, but then I started thinking about it and it occurred to me that this guy 04:55 was atrogant and it's not impossible that he might have incited a block chief or a Kapo or somebody who just strangled him on the spot and hanged him. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So you never know, I mean the dead ones don't talk and the ones who killed them wouldn't talk, so, and with this guy I'll get to, I'll tell you my philosophy and the suffering which got me through it, because when we carried those pre-fab sections, it was horrible, real back-breaking work, I thought, it'll kill me and I couldn't believe that I survived it and I didn't want to die the next day, because I said if I survived that, I don't want to die now and then it was again some very hard work and somehow managed to survive and then just didn't want to kill myself, but it would have been a way out, so it just, one hardship after another hardship, sort of just kept me going. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">If you survived that, you're not going to kill yourself now, I mean this is very bad, but not quite as bad as that was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  How do you want to wrap up, do you want to tell us about the end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  The end was...
QUESTION:  ... kind of an interesting story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  I had an accident on the <span class="DLF">work site</span> on February 28. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">It was one of those days when I felt very depressed and disgusted and I was pushing one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> on the <span class="DLF">work site</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> came up behind, pushing another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> and the fellows were yelling at me to jump, get out from there and I didn't realize they were yelling at me and they were not, apparently make too much effort to yell at me or get me out of there, I got caught between the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> and broke my wrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And immediately I was taken off the <span class="DLF">work site</span> , taken into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , report to SS, count one off from this work detail, they'll be coming in one short because he's coming in now and went to the, my clerk, block clerk, barracks clerk, who was a Pole who hated my guts because I always went to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he hated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He hated me for trying to get out of bad work details, so anyway, he walks me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he says, oh now you have it made, he says, the was will be over pretty soon and you can stay there until the end and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So I thought I had it made and even after war I thought I had it made, but what was the thing was I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish barracks</span> , the only place which was segregated inside the camp was the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they had one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for Aryan prisoners and one for Jewish and the ones in the Jewish got virtually nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And I showed you the ID badge, which I had here when I went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , by end of April I could pull it up here without, I mean if I didn't adjust it. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And I was just losing weight something awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">You could see it that my bones were sticking out, my ribs were sticking out and I saw people around me who looked like, I've never seen humans look that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I mean their chests look like they are sticking out like this, but it wasn't their chests were sticking out, it was their abdomens were completely sunk 1n and the pelvic bones were sticking out and the pelvic bones were sticking out in the front, on the side and the back and it was just frightful sight, I mean, I could figure that you could almost time yourself how soon you will be in that stage and they just used to grab them and toss them to the corner where there were the dead bodies and every day there was pile there, in every <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And it was just, the soup was just a broth and so much of it, maybe half liter, which 1s nothing and the bread was inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they used to get one-third of a bread and eventually they got cut down to one-quarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they used to give us like less than one-eighth and after awhile it wasn't bread any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Instead of flour, they put into 1t sawdust, instead of flour there was like a potato and it taste like a and it was nothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  I don't know what to say, when finally I saw the first American soldier, when . . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">End of Tape #4 Tape #5
ANSWER:  I was telling about the first American soldier whom we saw, it was on May eighth’, somewhere early afternoon and he was walking toward the <span class="BUILDING">Krema</span> , in front of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and as many of us as we could, we jumped to the <span class="DLF">window</span> to get a glimpse of him and he was just surrounded be prisoners who I suppose were, I don't know what you want to call them, ranking guys or guys from the resistance, or within the organization within or something like that and like three or four of them are talking to him at the same time, everybody was trying to talk to him, tell him how horrible the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was and everything and he was just going silently and walking towards and you asked me about foreign news, we had access to a Swiss magazine” and in that Swiss magazine we could see things and if it was blacked out, we were able to wipe the black off and that was where I first saw American soldiers, what they looked like, I never seen one before, pictures of them or, saw pictures of them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And this guy looked just like any one of those from the pictures, he had a helmet on and the short field jacket and he was alive and we just stared and nobody said a word, nobody screamed, nobody shouted, nobody cheered or waved, anything, we just were, by that time we were just numb, emotionally worn out and physically just like also very close to the end, also just 05:03 about worn out. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And I mean I can see him right in front of my eyes, the guy just walking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I don't remember if he was an enlisted man or an officer, but I mean, just walked calmly and all, only one, one that managed to get from, there were more of them probably, at the <span class="REGION">upper part</span> and where they came in, they might have to get one to come to look at the Krema and the dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And it took two days before the Americans got organized enough to feed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">So slow we thought it's forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And then, we were begging them for food and of course they didn't, were not carrying food with them when they came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to look at the thing, to see the sights. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And it was like almost you might say a horrible anti-climax, a horrible let down, I mean we expected that as soon as the <span class="DLF">gates</span> opened, we would all be free and we would be getting food and it would be just wonderful and it was nothing of the sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And one thing I wanted was to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as soon as I could because even after the Americans came in, I just hated those people with whom I was locked up there, it was like a, I was imprisoned with them, I was a captive audience to their stupid, endless bullshit, their endless yakking about empty things, about nothing and I just, on and on and on and on and I wanted to be away from them.</span></p>

wanted out of there and Americans finally processed us, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital unit</span> on eighth of May, two days after the liberation, that's when they came in, that's when they swarmed into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital compound</span> , in came the photographers and in came the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital units</span> , which later I found out was called a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> and they had pictures take, they were taking pictures of themselves with us and any way, they set up <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">portable showers</span> and they showered us, they got us out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and set up fires. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I had only, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> we only had shirts and I happened to have the worst knit shirt which was a haven for lice and it was just swarming with lice and as soon as I saw that fire, I just was the happiest person to toss those living lice into that and listen to how they crackle in the flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And they sprayed us with DDT and they gave us bits of German uniforms, which they got from some <span class="BUILDING">storage depot</span> and we were free to go into the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to look for <span class="BUILDING">nationality barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And there was, by then, the prisoners were broken up according to nationalities, whereas previously everything was mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So I looked for the <span class="BUILDING">Czechoslovak barracks</span> and I got the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunk</span> there, it was, <span class="NPIP">place</span> happened to be the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where I was when I worked in the night shift and instead of number seven on the board on top of it, now there was painted a Czech flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And again, the Americans fed us with food which they captured from some <span class="BUILDING">depots</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Every single day, a yellow pea soup and good bread, but I couldn't eat that bread any more, not in that stage, I mean I was, I hadn't had bread or decent food for, since I would say February 28th and this was May eighth and I was starving and I couldn't eat the food which they were giving us. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">It was a very bad scenario, as you would call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And day by day I got closer to dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And then, the Americans kept those who wanted to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , plus they set up a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">hospital tent</span> , where they also kept prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And they shipped out many prisoners from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Ischl</span> , which was a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they took over an <span class="BUILDING">SS hospital</span> there already, a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">So they spread out and the overcrowded camp was decrowded and the prisoners, the Polish and the Russians were separated out right away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and sent into a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which used to be before, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian camp</span> and so on and so forth and the ones who were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , got hospital food, which was to me, was better than the yellow pea soup and on one occasion, I was always roaming around looking or scrounging or something and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> on which was used to haul the containers, the food containers and it was, the people were pulling it to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and it had on it the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> food. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And everything was already, the German discipline was gone, the German organization was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">The containers no longer had the lids on them, the rubber gaskets were gone from the lids, nobody cared about anything, it was a big deal to be able to, the Americans or the prisoner committee managed to talk the cooks into staying on and cooking food for the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They felt the war is over and they don't have to work any more and there is no reason why, everybody's free and why they shouldn't be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So anyway, the food was sloshing from these containers and I got my bowl under it and I was collecting it and then I ate that soup and it was, to me it was at least something I could eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">There was only one catch, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> on which they were hauling the food was used the day before for hauling the dead bodies and some of the dead bodies were, maybe had, feces were coming out of them, nobody washed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">In other words, what I was getting was maybe excrement from dead bodies and I got the shits and it wouldn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I was free and I was closer to death than ever before. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And I got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and I still had the diarrhea and even the Czechs couldn't cure it, nobody could cure it, it took a long time, until a friend of the family got me some cocoa and that stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So, there's another one to whom I owe quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He's still alive today, he's in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  Could we look at the photos now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  Off the top.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">ANSWER:  That's one of the photos, which the American Signal Corp. photographers took in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> when they came into the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Hospital barracks</span> and I happen to be on this one, the second one from the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">As you can see, some of us had, were skinnier than I and my knees were sticking out, my ribs are visible and both my legs and my arms are rather skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I turned to the side, facing to the right, for what I would call positive identification, because I have a scar from an operation over the left ear and I always wanted to show that and for let's say someday it will be seen somewhere and I could definitely be sure that it's, prove it that that's me, that is I.
QUESTION:  Physically you were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  And my memory is not infallible, I can't tell you exactly when this picture was taken, it may have been taken in 1941 or '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">On the left side is my brother, the middle is my mother and the right side am I, I am and I can tell you for sure that at this point I was already in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Gymnasium</span> because each <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had a cap, sort of like a uniform cap and my brother is wearing the one from the <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> and I already am not wearing the one from the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian Gymnasium</span> and there was not yet Hebrew Gymnasium cap so it's somewhere in between, it's definitely 1941 or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">This is after I recovered, after the war, I believe in, late in '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">It took me awhile before my hair started to grow again, it was probably one of the reasons, I mean vitamin deficiency, it took my body a good number of months to get back to, let's say, in condition or anything, or normal and to put on some weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">On the Ebensee photo, I weigh about 30 kilograms, on this one I suppose it's around 60, 65 kilograms. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Many, many decades after Ebensee, like around 1978, when I lived in the <span class="REGION">Washington area</span> , I found out that the Ebensee, the Mauthausen register of prisoners is in the national archives and I went to look at it and it's in numerical order, so I'd no problem finding my entry on it, we all know our prisoner numbers, mine happened to be 68,308 and when I came upon it, 1t was just kind of earth shaking or whatever, I don't know, very upsetting and it was like, later on I got a copy of a page for a friend on which his name was and he says to me that it was like a page out of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and I think those words are about as apt as you can find and the ones who perished or were killed are crossed out with a <span class="DLF">line</span> , with red ink and those who died after a certain date are no longer crossed out because the book was kept only up to perhaps the last week in April, 1945, so anybody died the last week of April or the beginning of May, it seems that he's still alive, but he isn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Because they didn't get the chance to cross out his name and this one is my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">As I found out, the day after the liberation, from another prisoner who happened to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where he was, he was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sub camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> , which was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and as you see, most of these are youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">You can see there his date of birth is entered as 1930 or actually it was 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">You can see there are dates are also young ones there, like 1929, 1930 and they probably were also lying about their ages so they might have been even younger than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And again, these names of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , same way we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we never heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , we never heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> , I never knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> and the way this guy pronounced it, I thought it was Kuszen or something like that and many years later I saw it in print and it's Gusen and there is the date on which he died and, but I managed to obtain that date about a year, or two years after the war when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , somebody told me about an international refugee organization and they gave me the date then, which again, I did not know until then. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I had no idea if he's still altve somewhere or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">These are my maternal grandparents, who were so dear to me and who were so nice to me and who's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was like a refuge to me, many a times. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And with whom I could talk even more at ease or more closely that with my own parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Fannie Moskowitz and Samuel Moskowitz, David Samuel Moskowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">This is the prison bracelet which I have from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> and bears my number, 68,308 and as I explained, when I went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I could wear it on my wrist and then as I lost weight, I could bring it up all the way to my, virtually upper arm, I mean to the top of my forearm. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And the wire on it is from a blasting wire from the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> project. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Conclusion of interview. </span>
