<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell us your name, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Norbert Yasharoff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> in 1930, to the family of a prominent, successful Jewish lawyer by the of Yossif, or Joseph, Yasharoff and my mother, Nelly the daughter of Bulgarian Jewish parents who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , prior to World War One. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And then after the death of my grandfather, my grandmother and her three daughters, including my mother, came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me about growing up in this <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">What was your early childhood like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  To the best of my recollection, the early childhood was a very pleasant one: a life of comparative plenty, of wonderful vacations either in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> or the Black Sea in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> , with fine clothes mostly bought by my father on his business trips to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and other Western European capitals, a peaceful life, a very family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Our extended family was quite large, and our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , especially while my grandparents was alive — on my father’s side — was the center of that life. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So major Jewish holidays and any other festive occasions were festive, quite festive. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We had a large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Sofia</span> , not far from the <span class="BUILDING">Fire Brigade Headquarters</span> -- which was a landmark at that time — with a huge <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> with a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">gazebo</span> and wonderful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And memories from family gatherings either in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gazebo</span> or just sitting in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the early evening are really etched in my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In sum, until almost the fall — autumn of 1939, all my recollections are one of a pleasurable, warm and happy childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Do you have any sisters or brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Yes, I have a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">She was born in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> today with her family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  What was your awareness of being a Jewish child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Yeah, that a — my first clash, so to speak, with the reality of being slightly different from the other children in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> which I attended when, in the second grade, we started having so called religion lessons, verouchenie' in Bulgarian “study of the faith,” which I had to attend, or at least I thought that I had to attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I was being teased by other children about the role or the Jews in killing Christ and so on — which first took me aback and then, of course, became very unpleasant until my parents arranged for me to be excused. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And there was no problem — I was excused. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But that was the only awareness of being different and being sort of set apart or being teased about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Very rarely, the other children would use the Turkish word chifut*, which I understand it to mean “infidel,” or somebody of another, inferior, faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But that occurred very rarely until, as I say, the Autumn 1939, and the outbreak of World War Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Incidentally, we were vacationing in a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">spa resort</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soludervent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And we were — this was the eve of our return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> at the end of the vacation, August 31st, when in the evening over the radio came the news of the outbreak of World War Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I was nine and a half years, my little sister was three. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The only indication that...of course, I knew war is not a good thing, but what shook me at that time was...were the worried glances exchanged between the adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We were all gathering in the <span class="INT_SPACE">social hall</span> of that lovely <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and then one of them -- men, the Jewish friends -- in a group exclaimed, "Oh my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">What is going to happen with us now." </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And that shook me because I always regarded that man as a rock of strength and a power always cheerful and, and witty and he indeed looked distress and sort of, as though he suddenly got diminished in size in front of my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father was also very worried, but he didn't say much. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And then we went back, of course, to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Life continued normally, but for the first time, not only newspapers, but the radios started carrying very openly antisemitic statements. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Some of them even attributed to officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">For example, I remember on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at <span class="BUILDING">newsstands</span> reading the bold, in bold face, headlines speaking of the international conspiracy of Jews and many other things which I didn't even understand at the time but I had to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and ask my father for the meaning of those words. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But the impressions are -- they are engraved in my memory of the name Jews and all the other epitaphs and adjectives that came with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That was the Autumn of ‘39. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Apart from this, the beginnings of an anti-Jewish campaign in the press I don't recall anything worse happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Of course with the press and officials openly castigating the Jews, a lot of other people, who until that time we thought were friends, especially in my case, other children Christian children that lived up and down our <span class="DLF">street</span> — started using the word chifut more and more often. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And by -- in early 1940, I remember, and that particular Christian boy was -- I considered him a close friend because he would come and play in our <span class="DLF">front yard</span> almost every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So he started really teasing me and harassing me but -- and even getting very, very offensive -- telling me all that he had obviously heard at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about the Jews this or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I remember myself, a normally well behaved boy actually retorting with a curse, "I wish you were dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Now I mention ' Religious instruction (Bulgarian) * Kike (Bulgarian) this because a few months later, this boy got a sunstroke and died, and I felt such tremendous guilt that I sneaked at his funeral and watched a little bit the church services preceding the actual burial in secret, in a sort of childish attempt at atonement that what I felt was probably a death that I had brought about my intemperate reaction to his teasing. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But these are all very, very strong things for a 10 or 11 year old to experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I guess I was 10 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So that was 1940, things like that were happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The anti-Jewish campaign, as I say, was growing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  How were your parents reacting to all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">What was it like in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , of course the main topic of conversation was the War, how it was going, tremendous concern about the failure of the anti-Axis forces, especially the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and the fall of most of the <span class="REGION">Western Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Daily bulletins and consultations between my father and his friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They didn't conduct normal conversations about war. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They always would pull out a actual map of Europe and would move little pins on the map to see what had been lost to the Germans and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Growing concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">A lot of talk about what had happened already to Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what was probably happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">In 1940, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">there was no information about that at all reaching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">At that time, we still were...were still allowed to own radios so we can listen to the BBC and to other <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span> including the Voice of America, clandestinely of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="60"><span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> had not joined officially the Axis yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">This occurred toward the end of 1940, but this were the kind of conversations at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The thing that stands out in my mind is that younger members -- younger relatives would -- who belonged to Zionist organizations -- would speak about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> being the only salvation for Bulgarian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And my father, the well accepted, well adjusted not assimilated in the religious sense, but culturally assimilated Jew would always oppose that. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Even at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">As late as 1940, he could not imagine any circumstances under which it would be better to leave native and familiar Bulgaria for life in a murky, little known, uncharted territory in a <span class="REGION">British colony</span> in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So, I vividly remember those altercations with my younger -- well, younger relatives, male relatives, with my father always coming out against Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He, of course, lived to eat his words and ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as probably I'll talk about this later, at the end of War Two and with the establishment of the State of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Go back to that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and pins on the maps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The pins on the maps. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Nineteen forty-one, of course, Hitler finally, in spite of his pact with the Soviet Union, non-aggression pact orders the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Operation Barbarasa, if I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That was frightening for us for a number of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">That brought about the <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> ’s official joining of the Axis, and by March of 1941, if I am not wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Yes, yeh, I remember it exactly, and I'll explain in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="75"><span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> by signing the pact also agreed to allowing passage of German troops to <span class="REGION">Bulgarian territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">As a matter of fact, March 25, '41, the day my Grandmother died and that was the day of her funeral, coincided with the arrival of German troops in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Why do I remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Because just opposite our <span class="DLF">front courtyard</span> , there was the one and only <span class="BUILDING">Mercedes Benz dealership</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the first German troops that arrived started using that <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> , that <span class="BUILDING">dealership</span> , as a short of small <span class="BUILDING">local headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And a lot of these young, blond eyed and basically rather likeable young men were coming and using the <span class="DLF">fountain</span> in our <span class="DLF">front yard</span> to wash in the morning and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And so the Germans were there! </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Next <span class="DLF">door</span> to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Now this did not happen exactly on the 25th. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">This came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But what happened on March 25th we had a very impressive funeral procession for my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My father, being quite prominent in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and very active in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , the children of the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> would march first, then all the active Rabbis, four of them if I am not mistaken, would march after them, and then, of course, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> and the long procession of relatives and friends after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , on foot, all the way from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Sofia</span> , to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> which was a good 3 miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now at one point, just as our procession proceeds down one of the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , a detachment of German soldiers comes from the opposite direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And this is my recollection of myself suddenly freezing in my tracks and...and looking at both processions, and registering that while the ours veered a little bit to the side in order for the Germans to pass, none on both...no one on either <span class="NPIP">side</span> looked at each other's eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They just passed along side each other totally ignoring the existence of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And that is my recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That was March of '45.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  ‘41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Forty-one -- Sorry! </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Forty-one. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And a major thing happened in January of '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">By the end of 1940, under German pressure the Bulgarian Government decided that anti- Jewish laws modeled on the Nuremberg laws would have to be promulgated. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">This was a very firm demand on the Germans that neither the, by now, Fascist government of Bogdan Filov nor the King” were prepared to oppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They felt that this is the least they can do to accommodate the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So they, they had appointed by that time a so called Commissar of Jewish Affairs of one of the most virulent antisemites in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> , a member of the right-wing antisemitic group, Ratnitsi*, Aleksandur Belev, who was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to study the German legislation and bring back a Bulgarian version. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Well, he did, and by the end of 1940, that legislation, after debates and some quite vocal opposition in <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> , was adopted, signed by the King in early January, and its enforcement began in January of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And now, why do I remember all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Because suddenly -- and that preceded the death of my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">She was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But apart from our concern over her health, the other two major concerns that were discussed every opportunity at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> were, especially for Father, how to come up with a large sum of ready cash in order to pay our assessment under the so-called “unique tax” that was * King Boris III of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> * Ratnitsi Napreduka na Bulgarshtinata [Champions of the Bulgarian Advancement] (Bulgarian) imposed as a first step toward ultimate confiscation of Jewish property and “b” how to find documentary proof of his service some 25 years earlier as a military prosecutor with the Bulgarian Armed Forces -- a service that under the law could exempt him from some of the restrictions, especially the restriction on professionals to practice their profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">If I may jump into a little bit further into the future, he ultimately was able to prove that and for a while he enjoyed that privilege of continuing to work and not wearing the normal star -- the yellow Star of David, but a yellow little pin which indicated that he was a Jew, but a privileged Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, back to ‘41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  What else was happening in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It's January '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">You hear these arguments. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">What else is going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well then the death of my grandmother, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The Germans already being in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgarian</span> the unease -- especially of our family -- of having to confront German soldiers daily from early morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">That side by side with an ever growing anti-Jewish campaign in the Press, already with anti-Jewish legislation in force. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We were already marked as enemies of the people, as exploiters. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We weren’t wearing yet the yellow Star of David, but we were easy prey for anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Now the other stipulations of the law, which applied to Jews not being able to possess radios, telephones, began to be implemented. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">After the first payments of the unique tax, then Jews had to dispose of property. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They were allowed for the time being to keep an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or some other <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> for their own use, but even that became questionable by the Autumn of 1941, when a new regulation was published that Jews were not allowed to live in the general areas of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capital</span> but had to live either in or very close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yuch Bunar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Well, we ended up by October in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> sharing the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of relatives in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> very near to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> , but not inside of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But prior to that, we had to undergo another dislocation. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">In our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was a three story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , we occupied the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , which was the best designed, and we had lived in it for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But as I said with the Jews being easy prey for anything, a Bulgarian lawyer married to a German woman had cast his eye on our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Through his contacts with the Fascist authorities, we were given the order to vacate it in less than a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We moved downstairs into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was used before as an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And what stands out in my mind 1s that they -- the Bulgarian lawyer and his German wife moved in, they conducted a sort of cleansing, religious ceremony with holy water and everything, but expressly done in order to cleanse the Jewish spirit out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And we were even asked to be present at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Now I don't remember this myself, but I remember the mortification of my parents when that ceremony was over, to that extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we were supposed to continue living in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="130">From this point of view, it was lucky that we were forced to move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> where the Bulgarian authorities felt that we should be concentrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Little did we realize at the time that this was the first stage in a plan to eventually expel us from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , and as the original plans were, to ship us away to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  You are now in this bottom apartment? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">What was going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Your father, you told me, was involved in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Did that have any impact on this situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Not very directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Well, of course, he continued his work with the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> primarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And, as a lawyer, who was also accredited to the religious -- <span class="BUILDING">Jewish religious courts</span> because he could appear in personal status cases, divorces and so on, so he continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Well, he was being consulted very often by the, by the very active members of the Consistory, to -- what to do to alleviate the plight of some Jews from this stipulation of the law or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And this is what the Bulgarian Jews did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They pulled their resources of friends among the Bulgarian community, especially lawyers, doctors, intellectuals, writers, and so on, in order to -- here and there -- help each other obtain an exemption or alleviate some other case. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So to that extent he was very he was very active because he had contacts especially among the Judirical circles of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Some people did not turn their back on the Jews immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But here I have to -- if I may want to tell you of a little incident that occurred that showed me that not all former friends were ready to maintain the friendship and not turn their back. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And this may have been naturally earlier in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I know because I was 10 years old with another 10 year old Jewish friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We went to wait for a girlfriend of ours who lived opposite the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet Embassy</span> -- and of course, <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> never cut off its diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in spite of German pressure -- and she was a little delayed, so we went -- waited downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">There was, what we thought, a <span class="BUILDING">cab station</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi cabs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">My friend was the mischievous type. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He started playing with the tires of some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Of course, I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I was too well behaved to even think of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But he did 1t. And suddenly, what again we thought were the cab drivers, two of them rushed after him, trying to catch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">A third one came to me and he immediately pulled out a police badge and said, "Well, we are from the Secret Police and you are going to lead us to where your friend 1s." </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was stupefied, I didn’t know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Playing a little joke like that, yeh, it's bad enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But why would the police suddenly -- and people who were cab drivers? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Well, we ended up, both of us, in the — in what they called, well the headquarters of the Secret, Secret police, the Bulgarian equivalent of perhaps the KGB. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And you can imagine trying to investigate two 10 years old which involved writing depositions slowly in our calligraphic style. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Finally, my father was brought in, and I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Apparently the chief investigator knew my father very well from appearances in <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> , he himself having -- being a lawyer, the investigator. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He never turned to face my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He was looking all the time at the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And he gave him a lecture in my presence, which is the first time that I had ever seen anybody talk down to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">For me, my father was the one who would talk down to anyone else, including myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Suddenly, I see my father, as elegantly dressed as ever, but almost like shrinking <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and I think I mentioned this before, but this is what happened in the vision of a 10 year old where all these strong men suddenly under the pressure of humiliation and degradation, shrink in size in your eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Because they, they cannot do much to defend themselves and, and then you -- for a moment, you start to lose a little bit even your previous respect for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But there was my father silently listening to this sermon about the way the Jewish families raise their children in an anti-Bulgarian, anti-nationalist, anti-governmental spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">My father who had been the epitome of good citizenship throughout his life -- a Jew who insisted we speak -- that without any trace of Ladino or other Jewish accent -- the Bulgarian language because he spoke it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He had to listen to this petty functionary who didn't have even the guts of turning and walk -- and looking him in the eye, for half an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Finally, the verdict was 500 leva which quite a bit of money at that time, almost 500 dollar fine, and the warning that should I be caught doing such subversive things in the future, the consequences will be much, much harsher. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Now what was the whole thing about? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">What did it turn out to be? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Those so called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi cabs</span> were actually Secret Service people in disguise stationed at a reasonable, but still very convenient distance from the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet Embassy</span> , and with orders to be ready every time a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> pulls out from the Soviet Embassy to follow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So the assumption was that we had been sent by someone to sabotage the Secret Police's attempts to monitor the movements of the Soviets in the Capital. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But by the time of our release, I'm sure that even that antisemitic investigator was convinced that there was no plot here and no conspiracy, just the act of a foolish boy, and watched and not prevented by another small foolish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So, I took you back to 1940, but to go back to the end of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">As I mentioned by October of that year, we had relocated for a second time and began living in the ghettoized area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Another almost traumatic experience of the time was the fact that the Bulgarians, being under constant German pressure to make the life of Jews more and more miserable in order to prepare Bulgarian public opinion for an eventual deportation of Jews, the Bulgarian government brought to trial a Jewish industrialist, the only one who was allowed to continue working under the anti-Jewish legislation, as a manager of his expropriated plant, a <span class="BUILDING">textile plant</span> , was suddenly brought to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> on the charges of economic crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were trumped up charges. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">My father, who had been his lawyer for many, many years, began defending him in this case. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Well, for all those who -- for all Jews who were watching the trial and knew about what an economic crime charge meant and what it would bring, it was obvious that the man will not -- his life will not be spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But my father invested all of his Judirical talent in the hope that maybe through effective -- an effective defense, he could save him. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Well, he did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And not only that he was sentenced to death, but my father was -- I mean the client was sentenced to death, but my father was forced to observe the actual execution to hang him. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And I will never forget this man and his face when he came back from that execution that afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I had never seen him more devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Totally devastated and blaming himself for not having done enough when everybody knew that it was -- this was just a show trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The Bulgarians had to have something to show both the Germans and also the general populace that the Jews were economic exploiters and criminals who, in spite of all the legislation against them, were still prone to commit crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So that was end of 1940 -- 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  What was life like for you at that point in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Did I say ‘41?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  The end of 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">No, Iam sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">All this happened toward the end of 1940 -- 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Yeh, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  All the events of the trial and also the relocation occurred in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Life while we still were not -- we were not restricted in our movements.... We could go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Yeh, we could go out, there were no prohibited <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I think toward the very end, in the beginning of 1943, some night curfews were imposed on Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Imposed in the sense that we were not supposed to be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> after nine o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But some Jews did not fully comply with that and because the wearing of yellow Stars of David was not fully enforced yet, some of them could get away with breaking the curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But by early 1943, every Jew from the age of 10 up, including myself, had to wear the yellow Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">My father wore for awhile just the yellow pin. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">By that time he was still practicing, but in a very, very limited manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Our lives were mainly revolved around the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the central synagogue of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , to which we went more often than ever before. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And, of course, there was another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the proper <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> proper, the Yuch Bunar, but we mainly went to the <span class="BUILDING">central synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Friends and family would gather and that was our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Of course, living in much -- in cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , sharing -- two or three families sharing one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Luckily we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a half so that I had at least a separate <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep than my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It was bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Strangely enough from a childish viewpoint all of these things had also a funny and, and exciting aspect about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was never boring. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">One had to adjust to new situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Some of them were very, very joyful because people were thrown together more with family and with friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And when people tried to alleviate their plight, you know, they become very resourceful and there was always entertainment of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">This continued even during the darker years of the expulsion and the resettlement outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Some of these aspects.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  What about food? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Did you have any trouble getting food at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  No, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">No, not at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Most Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> were middle class Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Of course, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yuch Bunar</span> were less educated and more impoverished. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But nobody at this point starved yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The people, in spite of all the, the taxation and the expropriation, and being prohibited from working and holding jobs, people still could survive on savings and on loans from family and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Incidentally, as early as the summer of 1941 and through 1942 and through most of '43, Jewish men from the age of 18 through, I think 38 or 40, were all called up for service in what at the beginning were labor brigades within the framework of the Army and Corps of Engineers in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and later under the Ministry for Public Works. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">This was, in effect, forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">These were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> so which they were not paid anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They were away from their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And when the time for the expulsion of Soviet Jewry arrived, many families did not have their males with them in order to help organize the quick departure and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I touch on that in a letter that I wrote in June of 1943 from the northern city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> to a cousin of mine who, because he was so much older, I called “Uncle” — addressed as “Uncle.” </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And he was one of those Jewish males who had been away for almost two years serving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and away from his own family when they had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , so in a way my letter describes to him the day when we saw his own family off at a time when he was not around. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But that was when we were expelled ultimately to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Since we are touching on that, why don't I go into the quickly developing events of the Spring of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">By May 19th, suddenly through the grapevine -- because we no longer had access to radios, but some people did listen clandestinely at the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of Bulgarian friends, but mainly from newspapers, which of course we could still obtain -- the news came that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radio Berlin</span> had announced that the Bulgarian government was planning the deportation of all Bulgarian Jews from the old boundaries of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Immediate panic and chaos! </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Although we didn't really -- we had no firm news about the fate of the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or those Jews who were being deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but the feeling was that nothing good was happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So tremendous fear and panic! </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Some Jewish families within two days started getting the first orders for so-called resettlement in the provinces. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The orders gave them between three to five days to get ready to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">By the evening or night of May 22nd, 23rd, and this is another thing that I describe in the letter I mentioned, the news become bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Jewish leaders in their attempts to get firm news from the authorities from the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , from -- were unable to reach anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Obviously, even the King had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at that time, in spite of the fact that this was the eve of a major Bulgarian holiday May 24th, Saint Cyril and Methodius, which is the day of education, the day of Bulgarian culture, with the King usually present at the parades that take place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But he was no where to be reached. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Finally, some Jewish leaders managed to get hold of the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Bulgarian Orthodox church</span> -- Archbishop Stefan”, known for his pro-Allied sympathies in spite of the fact that he was at the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Bulgarian church</span> at the time when <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> was already allied with the Axis. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And he immediately started calling people -- top people in the government -- and personally went even to the <span class="BUILDING">King’s palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">He was unable to talk to the King but he left a strongly worded note there warning the King, that God will not be merciful if he signs the death warrant of the Jews by expelling them, the assumption being expulsion first from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> to other outlying areas close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> for eventual shipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Whether this worked or not, the fact is that none of the expulsion orders were rescinded but the original plans developed by that Commissar for Jewish Affairs under German pressure and with an explicit agreement with the German Ambassador to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , of which we learned later, the plans were to -- the expulsion to be only the first phase of a two phase process -- the second being shipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Well, the second phase was never carried out, which explains the facts that all of us Bulgarian Jews who numbered about 48,000 at the time of these events, survived with a few exceptions of Jewish partisans and others who took part in the resistance against the Fascist regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Let's go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You are about to be deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Tell me what happens to you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Well, those were horrible days, especially the night of May 22nd, 23rd which remains engraved in my memory as the most horrible night that we went through when we, we knew that we're going to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That was the conviction at the time, that this is what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We didn't sleep at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The four of us, my little sister, mother and father, hugging each other and crying, at one point my father saying that, well the need may arise for my mother and him to leave the two of us, my sister and I, in the care of others in order to save us. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We, in turn, started crying and saying that, no way, we were not going to part with them no matter what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The morning finally mercifully put an end to that night, but with even worse news that more Jews had received eviction -- expulsion notices. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And stories from our own members of our family who lived in the Jewish quarters that people are running to the Jewish Community Council asking for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The Jewish functionaries being even more confused than the poor people themselves, being totally of no help. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Finally, a lot of Jews congregating in the <span class="BUILDING">central synagogue</span> where the Chief Rabbi tries to sooth them and assure them that everything possible by way of protest and intercession will be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The Jews dispersing that evening feeling a little more encouraged, but still very, very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The following day, the holiday that I mentioned, May the 24th, Jews again congregate in, or try to congregate in -- at the <span class="BUILDING">central synagogue</span> , but they find it locked because some of the Jewish leadership decided that it will be too dangerous to allow a large crowd to assemble because the Fascist authorities immediately will try to disperse it by force. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">> Metropolitan Stefan of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> Besides the feeling was that with the pent up emotions and fear and panic, a demonstration may occur, which again will end in bloodshed. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Some of the leadership or most of the leadership was in favor of trying to enlist the help of sympathetic Bulgarians and the <span class="BUILDING">Church</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> rather than engage in demonstrations and clashes with the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">In spite of all that, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> proper, a group of 200 and more Jews did organize themselves and started a demonstration which was put down with tremendous cruelty by the Bulgarian police and agents of that <span class="BUILDING">Commissariat</span> for Jewish Affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">As my cousin, who is exactly my age told me at the time -- and he went -- recently when we met after so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He was watching the whole thing from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> of their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the Bulgarian authorities had brought the machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Of course, guns and every conceivable weapons against totally unarmed, but young and strong Bulgarian young -- Jewish young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There was a scuffle. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Some of the policemen were hurt simply by the physical strength of some of these guys, but eventually everybody was rounded up, beaten, and some of them even ended up being sent to the only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that was established in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> -- a real Nazi-style <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It's not far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to which we were eventually banished, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The name of the place of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Somovit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Later, Jewish leaders, especially those who were very active in the protest action and enlisting help of sympathetic Bulgarians, were rounded up, arrested, and banished to that same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">When I say “Nazi-style,” of course, I mean the day-to-day treatment, but they all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">No one was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Other Jews, who had been apprehended as partisans fighting with the Communists or other anti-Fascists resistance ended up in special <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for partisans which were harsher. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They were not sent to the same one, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So this is --we are speaking about May 24, 1943 -- the demonstration in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> crushed the attempts of Jewish leaders to cancel the orders of expulsion failed, but at least intervention of the <span class="BUILDING">Church</span> and other members of the intelligentsia seemed to have convinced the King to rescind the order for the further -- for phase number two, namely the shipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That is very important to note because if that was not -- if that ultimate shipment was not postponed, we would have ended up like all the other 6,000,000 Jews in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">By postponing it, even for a few months it made a whole difference because in the meantime events like the Battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and the Allied landings 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> -- in one word, the beginning of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's defeat had already become a process which was watched carefully by the Bulgarian authorities, by the King. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Historical experience had taught them that in 19-- in World War One, as Allies again of the German lead entente, they were losers, dismembered in terms of <span class="REGION">territory</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So the beginning of caution and a little of putting a little bit of distance between <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and the Germans had begun, at least in the minds of the King and some other leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">From -- which in turn mean that it would be most foolish at that point, with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> obviously losing the War, to hand them over the Jews and thus be branded as a collaborator of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and a very humanitarian issue, while by saving the Jews, <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> could score some points in a future peace conference and get more lenient treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">That was the thinking as, of course, we learned after the War from many, many writings on the subject both from ex-officials and others on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Eventual shipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was cancelled as a plan, but our expulsion from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Our own family had to leave three or four days after May 24th, we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> , which we had asked for as a matter of fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  Back up a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Before we get there, I would like to know about that journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Well, the journey itself was rather pleasant, you know, packing and, of course, disposing of most of our stuff either by selling it or passing it on to Bulgarian friends for safekeeping was a very painful process, especially when my mother was ill at the time and in <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , so my father and I virtually had to, had to do the whole packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But again, I, as a child, for me these were tremendous responsibilities and the very fact that I was able to, to be of some constructive help gave me tremendous satisfaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We were ready by the day mentioned in our expulsion orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">My mother, luckily, had fully recovered, and we all went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And again, here, friendships and, and the fact that most Bulgarians, especially urban Bulgarians, had no history of virulent or deep seated antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Little acts of help and assistance and moral support were not uncommon. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">In our particular case we were met at, at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> by a Bulgarian friend in a high position with the <span class="DLF">Bulgarian railroads</span> who quietly led us to a <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , almost a first class <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The rest of our brethren had to travel third class, but again, there were no, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> which our other brothers were carried in to their deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">No, it was a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bulgarian train</span> , and we were given a very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The men helped us quieted the whole time, but before bidding goodbye and a very curt goodbye, we saw that his eyes were filled with tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He was afraid to speak openly in order not to be seen being so kind to the enemies of the people as we were being to be at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But he wanted to say silently and through his tears that there are Bulgarians who feel that this is a tremendous and crazy injustice being done to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It was a very moving moment at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The trip itself was very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Of course, for two children like my sister and I, we looked at the June sunny sky and it was fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  At that point, let us stop please. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I want to change -- we have to change tapes and then we'll pick it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Would you tell us what happened when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  We were met at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> by the sister of -- well by the sister of the husband -- my aunt's husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They were originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> and that's why we actually pushed to get sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> because we had some family there on, on my aunt's side -- her husband's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So these nice people were there waiting for us, as they had probably done it for many other friends and acquaintances from <span class="COUNTRY">Sofia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They took us directly to their own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">A small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but on three <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , already filled with other expellees from <span class="COUNTRY">Sofia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And they gave us their own <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and they moved to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> in order to accommodate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">After all the shocking and enervating events of the days prior to our departure from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , spending two days in the warm and cheerful hospitality of Mrs. Visa and her husband -- that was her name -- was very, very recuperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">By that time the old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I would call him Uncle Isaac, the husband of my aunt was born and raised, his native city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> and which was occupied by another sister of his again became partly available for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I must mention that my Uncle Isaac and my Aunt Lisa and her two children also came with us on the same, on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So whatever -- what living arrangements were made, they were all made for the two families. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Of course, with us always being given a little bit of priority because we were the guests so to speak and they were returning <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Well, eight of us were accommodated in one truly large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with nice access to the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">These are one story <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> , very rustic, but we had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over our heads and at the beginning, you know, we were treated as guests, always having food prepared by those who already were living there, in the Pleven branch of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So the first few weeks were, weeks of adjustment to a totally new -- to a totally new reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But strangely enough, we arrived -- solace and even enjoyment -- when discovering that what we had thought originally that was going to be even worse did not materialize. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So for example, we would compare notes with other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> about which we were getting information about restriction on Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">If we had, let's say only four hours of curfew a day, as opposed to -- as compared to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> where the Jews were not allowed in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> at all, for a while at least, which did not happen, or if we had more <span class="DLF">parks</span> available and open to us while other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> did not allow their Jews to go to <span class="DLF">parks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We derived pleasure from such little comparisons as to what can we get away with. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And indeed after awhile the local authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> saw in that influx of Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> basically a tourist bonanza of sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Well some of us, regardless of the fact that we were not allowed to hold jobs and not own officially property, but some of us had money that was either given to Bulgarian friends and then smuggled monthly back to us, but some money was brought to each of these <span class="REGION">outlying areas</span> by the more prosperous Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Now, the majority were not in that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The majority had to be quartered with other Jewish families and this was supervised by the Commissariat of Jewish, of Jewish Affairs very strictly -- sometimes cramming three or four families in a very, very small <span class="BUILDING">three room house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">But no one was left without a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">There was no need, and I am speaking of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> but I think the same happened in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> to which Sofia Jews were banished. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There were no large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration style camps</span> or <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> established for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They were all quartered with other Jews, other local Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Now, while <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> was taken care of unsatisfactorily -- but still was taken care of this way of course -- the question of food was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Many, many Jews didn't have the financial resources to buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So again, Jewish organization began to, to occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The already existing <span class="BUILDING">Pleven Constitory</span> of Jews was expanded with members among the new arrivals from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , my father included. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">These people quickly organized <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> to ensure that those Jews who could not afford to buy their own food will have two hot meals daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The money came primarily from those Jews who, who had some money, and some money was provided by the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, the very, very bare minimum of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Other resources must have been coming from somewhere, but I really have no recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I clearly remember the, the long <span class="DLF">lines</span> twice a day of the Jews waiting to get their soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">All this happened -- would occur in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> where -- which was the center of all Jewish activities from <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> to lectures to concerts that we organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Even a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was organized there. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Although we were not prohibited from attending <span class="BUILDING">Bulgarian high schools</span> -- and I, in fact, began my first class of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> wearing my Star of David -- but yes, Children up to the age of 13 could not attend <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I remember it because I used to take my little sister to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in the morning and pick her up at noon. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So she could go only to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I described a moment ago where everything else took place, including a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But surprisingly everything functioned superbly. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Both the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> , all the cultural activities that were organized with a lot of talent, of course, being present among the Jews there to keep up the spirits of that community. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And to that extent I am very proud of my father for being one of those who, who helped organize all this, and in that comes a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Now, of course, they were all under the watchful eye of the antisemitic Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, but apart from being personally liable for any infractions of the law, they were in no way to be compared to some of the Judenrats® in, in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> during the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Of course, ° Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to their circumstances were much more horrible with the Germans being actually there. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And a matter of life and death -- I'm not sarcastic here -- making any judgments, but the Jewish Consistories in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulgarian cities</span> were totally different from the Judenrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So these are my impressions of Jewish life there and, and they are not unpleasant impressions obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I was not one of those who had to wait for soup on the -- I might have felt totally differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But there was a lot of togetherness. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Many Jews became more Jewish during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Many Jews became exposed to Zionism for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">There were lectures on Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Many Jews started studying Hebrew for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So there was a Jewish reorientation, per force perhaps, but nevertheless a positive phenomenon. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">There were, of course, the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">How did the outside world treat us. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">After all, we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We had curfew hours, mainly the evening at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">our movements were not that restricted even in the beginning, because it was felt that it would be good for the local economy to allow Jews to go to the movies whenever they wanted or to the few <span class="NPIP">places</span> that had some, some sweets or -- remember this is the war with rationing and everything, so many, many foods were absent. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">As I said, I was attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">In my case I was the only Jew in class. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And again, a little episode here which I think is worth mentioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">The non-Jewish members of the class, of course, treated me very badly -- mainly verbal abuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Occasionally on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , in the <span class="DLF">street</span> young members of the...of the youth Fascist organization Branik who really resembled very much in their uniform, the Brown, the Brown shirts in the Hitlerjugend’ in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I knew in advance that if -- when I saw a couple of them that I will be beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So I used to brace myself for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I would pass by. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They will slap me in the face, or do something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I knew that I shouldn't do a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You know the Nazi, to provoke them further because there was no telling what will happen and just proceed, go on my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">This happened at least once a week to me on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or back. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> proper, the amazing thing was that the teachers would very often stand up in my defense or would give lectures to, especially a teacher of German -- of the German language -- which I was forced to learn at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And when she heard some remarks in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and or saw them pushing me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , finally one day, she started speaking about Heine*. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And she pointed out, “But do you know that Heine was Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="388">She turned to the class, ““And what does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">That a person can be a Jew and can be a good German, a great German poet and writer, just as we have Jews in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> who are poets and writers and mathematicians” -- because of a major, prominent mathematician was among the Jews expelled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> and living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> at the time, and he was well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So I will never forget this kind of support from this woman who was basically educated in the German language and had traveled extensively to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but remained totally uncontaminated by Nazis on the oversee Jewish communities and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization. * </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Christian Johann Heinrich Heine crazy hatred of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">On the contrary, she stood up. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">She even exempted me from giving the Fascist salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Here I should back up and say that every, every class in different subjects -- be it Latin, or Bulgarian language and literature, or German language and literature -- would start with the people's jumping to salute when the Heil Hitler sign or the Bulgarian equivalent of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Be it in Latin “Pro Regia in Patria Parati Summus,” “For the King and country, we're ready to die.” </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The same thing in German, and the same thing in Bulgarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Well, she allowed me to remain seated when she would enter the class and the rest would have to give the Fascist greeting to her in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Yeh, so this was still 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Yeh, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">By that time, not only the attitude of individuals like this teacher, but it began to be obvious that even the authorities had embarked slowly and tacitly without any announcement on a sort of benign neglect policy vis a vis the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">In other words, all the anti-Jewish legislation had to be carried out, but without the same fierce -- without the fierceness that characterized that implementation at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And this again was due to the fact that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was losing the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">The Soviet Army was advancing rapidly across its own <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I do not remember whether it was early 1944 or end of 1943 that. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">the Russians had virtually expelled all Germans from their <span class="REGION">territory</span> and were now advancing across Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">No, it must have been early 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">But anyway -- oh, the major event which I have to come back to in 1943 the sudden death of King Boris, the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> mysteriously -- mysterious death following by two days his return from a meeting with Hitler at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgaden</span> at Hitler's request. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">The King at that time must have been in his early 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We all knew him as a very athletic man, a hunter, a man who exercised and hiked a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The official story was that he had died of a- from thrombosis, from heart ailment. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Nobody believed that at the time, but we didn't know any better. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Only after the War did we learn that at that fateful meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgaden</span> , Hitler had asked him very firmly for two things: to finally hand over the Jews, and to finally send an expedition in force to fight the Soviets on the <span class="REGION">Eastern Front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The King rejected both demands off hand at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">It would have been suicidal for him to agree to such acts at the time when Hitler was already losing the War and he maintained diplomatic relations with, with the Soviet Union until the very last moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">In fact, it was the Soviets who after even the establishment of the very pro-Allied government in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> by September fifth of 1944, they declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> for political reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But to go back to the death of the king, that was a tremendous event. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Obviously, we, the Jews did not know how to feel because we weren't sure how helpful he had been to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He obviously had acquiesced with a lot of the persecutions against us, but still a King is a King and we were watching with the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> the news reels of his, of his funeral which was really very dramatic with hundreds of thousands of ” For King of our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> we are always ready (Latin) people lining the routes of the funeral procession in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">After his death, his son, who was still a minor, was proclaimed King, but he had to rule with the help of a council of regents made of three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">One of them was the Mr. Filov who, until that time, was Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and was responsible for most of the antisemitic actions of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The fact that he became a regent and someone else, again from the Fascist party, came to power at least explains the benign neglect towards the Jews, the -- that occurred towards the end of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They were preoccupied with other things and besides, the new Prime Minister, although a Fascist, was not such an ideological fanatic as Mr. Filov who and the other Minister Gabrovski'°, Minister of Internal Affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  Bring this back. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">How did this affect you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  You mean that period of the--
QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Of the benign neglect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  Yeh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Well, life was getting more hopeful. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was obvious that even the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs did not, did not bother so much about, about supervising every little detail of the -- of life in the Jewish Community of Pleven and my father being one -- a member of the Consistory, that was a relief because they didn't have to be called up and lectured or abused verbally about the little local commissars. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Conversations at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or when visiting friends and relatives, of course, would continue to be conducted on -- with little maps about the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">How we got our information? </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Apart from newspapers, it was very difficult, but some Jews managed to smuggle — no, to smuggle themselves into the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of Bulgarian friends and listen secretly to the BBC and the Voice of America and then, of course, pass it on to the rest of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So we were informed about the, the progress of Allied advances all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And becoming more and more hopeful that if nothing had happened until then, it was obvious that we, we may not be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">That fear was lurking all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So the prayers were, “Let the Allies arrive as quickly as possible and liberate us." </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Now we did not know that last minute death marches occurred in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and anything -- a lot of similar things could have happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But you know, when you want to believe, you believe that you may be saved somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And things continued improving in winter and spring of ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">It was felt slowly that <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> was trying to disengage its -- to put more ’° Petur Gabrovski and more distance between itself and the Axis. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Not by any terribly dramatic overt actions, but simply by, by doing less of, let's say, antisemitic propaganda in the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Not rescinding any of the existing laws or regulations, but not introducing new ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And by end of May of ‘44, a new government under I think the name is Bagrianov'' came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Mr. Bagrianov made a speech at the beginning which sounded very, very encouraging more by what he omitted to say against the Allies or in favor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> than by what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He organized his government. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">We began feeling that some of the restrictions were quietly lifted against us, but minor restrictions, like restrictions on movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">For example, the night curfew by that time was quietly dropped -- at least in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> , that's what I can speak about. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">By August -- and I remember the date because it was the date of the speech, the speech of Mr. Bagrianov for the radio about which we knew somehow in advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">We must have gotten the word through a <span class="BUILDING">Western Radio station</span> that he will make a major speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And in that speech he openly started speaking against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , about the desire of his government to leave the Axis, about his desire to meet Allied terms, reasonable terms for peace, and about the abolition, the abolition in the new future of all anti-Jewish legislation. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And, indeed, by August 30th of the, of the same year, all anti-Jewish laws were rescinded. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">That was nine or 10 days before the Soviet Army entered <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Feelers to the Allies for a separate peace were sent out. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">In the meantime, the Soviet Army was advancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Several governments were toppled and came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The most recent -- on September second -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muraviev</span> ’’, a very pro-Western, liberal person, who openly declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but did not get any peace offer from anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So, for a few days <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> was at war with all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in the world, both with the Allies and with the, with the Axis. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Then the Red Army marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> unopposed on September ninth. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">This coincided with partisans of Bulgarians and among them Jews coming down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and taking over power in the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I was there when this occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I don't know why I was on the <span class="DLF">street</span> -- on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , actually, when the partisans came down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> , took positions with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">By that time the Fascist police had totally disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And then some of them, I think, some of the Jewish partisans who could spot the Jewish young boys like me -- I was 14 at the time -- will recruit us on the spot to come with them while searching the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of prominent Fascists, especially former police chiefs and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I was taken by one young partisans to help him go through the pockets of the just- deposed Chief of Police of Pleven. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">It was quite an experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was shaking, '' Tyan Bagrianov '* Kosta Muraviev shaking more, more violently than the man himself who knew that he will be shot almost the same day, and I think he was, by the partisans, summarily without any.... But you couldn't blame them knowing what the local police had done against partisans, bombing entire <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with the people in them when they would get word that the partisans were hiding and this again, we eyewitnesses to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So a personal experience was helping a young partisan while he was holding the gun pointed at the local Chief of Police and I went through his pockets and searched him bodily, him and his wife and his young daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Another impression deeply engraved from the same day when the partisans came down -- I remember one Jewish partisan marching into the <span class="BUILDING">Consistory</span> , and then at gun point marching out all the members of the entire leadership, including my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Now, this partisan was a Communist who felt that the previous -- the Jewish leadership who had helped the Jewry -- the local Jewry really survived the impact quite well, but that they were not progressive enough for his taste. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">This very soon was taken care of because obviously this Jewish partisan was acting on his own, and not with the knowledge of the Fatherland Front which was the umbrella organization of all anti- Fascist forces, with the Communist Party, of course, playing a very leading role in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But it was a wide coalition at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And they had -- they were very well informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They did not consider any Bulgarian Jew as a collaborator of the Fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So this was taken -- but it was a very ugly thing for these people, finally on the day of liberation, rejoicing, having kept the spirit, to be marched out as criminals by an over zealous Jewish Communist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  Were you there when that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I remember my father coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I was next to them because the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of the former Chief of Police, whom I had helped search, and the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> were very close to each other so after having helped the one partisan in his job, I was already free to go, and went naturally to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And suddenly I see my father being, being marched out at gunpoint together with the five or six other members of the Consistory. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But it lasted very briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Apparently, they were just taken to -- I don't know- to a <span class="BUILDING">local headquarters</span> of the partisans and within the hour, they were released with apologies. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">This was -- but I was very shocked, and very, very deeply hurt, because I knew how we had all prayed for the partisans, for the liberators, for the Allies to come and here we are suddenly again the enemies of the liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">That was really ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But it was handled properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">That was September 9, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  How did your family now react? </span><span class="sentence" id="490">What was happening to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  Well, with tremendous joy because obviously we were free again, free to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">A little worried as to what a Soviet occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> would mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">After all, we had read that and seen movies about life in the Soviet Union prior to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The news about the agreements at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yalta</span> became finally filtering to us and we began realizing that Europe had been sort of divided into spheres and that we unfortunately belonged to the sphere that would be under Soviet control. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But again the joy of just being free again, of being alive, of having survived it all and of going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> soon was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And indeed, within the week, we were already back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , back in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I have no recollections as to how. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Oh yes, the previous occupants as very involved with the with the Fascist authorities had escaped, had escaped, and I think they had escaped by the wife pulling out a pistol on a domestic flight and forcing it into <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Yes, that, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So we found our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We did not conduct any religious cleansing services as they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Maybe we should have, but we were happy to be back and, and with us came the family of my Aunt Lisa, and her two children, and we were only too glad to give them one of the three <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">The <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> became theirs because their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had been demolished by an American incendiary bomb during -- there were two or three bombing attacks on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Allied planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was mainly American and one of them was in February, I think, of ‘44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Let's just stay where you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  So, yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So, we are back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> , resuming our lives as best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I remember that I immediately had to worry about my next <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">It was obviously past September first, when the school year would really start. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But because of the chaos and the changing governments and everything we were getting extensions, but by October I enrolled in, in one of the better Sofia public high schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Before you go in to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , take, take a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Tell me please the affect of the Soviet occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">You were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> first and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> , of course we, on the date when the Russian Army finally reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> , they had, of course, come to -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> and to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , through the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> , but troops obviously entered every major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulgarian city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We all went out to greet them out of curiosity, but also in a fact they were our liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">But at the back of my mind, I remember -- for example, people, Jews -- Jewish people on the eve of the arrival of Soviet troops in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pleven</span> would urge each other, "Well, take good care of your jewelry and whatever little gold you have because, you know, you never know with the Soviets.” </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And in deed, some of the -- now I have not personally seen that or experienced it, but many, many people were telling of the way Russian soldiers, once they arrived and would start marching down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or become traffic policemen or whatever, would stop people and simply rip their watches off their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">They were very, very hungry, if I can use that word, for the basic amenities of the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Because, by their standards, <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> was the West at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Other excesses really I have not seen or observed. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They were behaving as a sort of benign occupation army. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Because, after all, <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> did not offer any opposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">The old Bulgarian gratefulness to the Russian people for their liberation from the Turks back in 1878 is a thread that really passes through Bulgarian history. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">No matter what happens, the Bulgarians will never be anti- Russian or even anti-Soviet in the sense that some other <span class="REGION">Eastern European countries</span> can be, because of that historical indebtedness that Bulgarians feel toward the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">There were, were no excesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But of course, one could feel the firm grip of the Soviet occupation forces in the sense of organizing the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The Fatherland Front was set in place with <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> what -- in which all of these anti-Fascist forces were represented. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But what gradually started happening from ’44 -- from the end of ‘44, ‘45 was a gradual reassertion of the Communist element of that coalition. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The gradual and quiet disappearance of opposition leaders without any explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It transpired that they were liquidated physically, one by one, gradually to the point that by 1947, when elections were held, the Communist Party had already solidified its control over the whole government and the rest of the so-called coalition partners were really figure heads that didn't, didn't count for much. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But that's -- this is already jumping ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  You are now. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">This is now ‘45 in the Fall, in October and you are going back to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  No, ’44, October.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Forty-four, October. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">You are going back to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">What happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">What was your life like at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Well, it was a very exciting time to be back at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because after so many years of suppression and oppression as a Jew, this time, we, the Jews -- the few Jewish pupils - students in every class would feel that we are now in power. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And at the beginning, we indeed felt that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We could see how former Fascist or former members of those youth organizations that were there, and we knew how they behaved, cowered in our presence, were afraid that we might denounce them or take some other revenge which we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">But it was very pleasant for awhile to feel on top of the world in this case. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Some of us with childish and or youthful enthusiasm and naivete began believing very sincerely in the goals of the Fatherland from this wide coalition of forces opposed to such bad things like Fascism and Imperialism, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We were very quickly disabused from that original idealistic sympathy, because it was obvious who was running the show. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">After a while it was obvious that every, even the Fatherland Front meeting would ultimately become a session of typically Communist criticism of self criticism. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And we had read enough by that time of Marx literature which was fed to us at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to know that these were purely Communist ideological tools and were not typical of, let's say, the progressive agrarians or some of the other smaller parties that were in the coalition. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">A strange phenomenon also began. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">A new form of antisemitism based on the revulsion of some even progressive Bulgarians, from some of the ideological and other excesses of Jewish Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And with time, we began -- we Jews ourselves began to be quiet annoyed and in some cases, quite resentful of that attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Well, I will come to that in a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">My own experiences in one of those so-called volunteer labor brigades.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Well, let's move a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Let's talk about -- you are in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">By ‘47, you had been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> now for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Things begin to change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Actually by ‘47, I had been for three academic years in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I graduated because the new government had abolished the so-called eighth grade of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which would be equivalent to the American -- well, the last grade of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So I graduated very young at the age of 17, and, of course, had to think about my higher education. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Now this was already in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">The elections took place, supervised by the Communists, and the Communist Party was returned by 99.9 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I leave it to historians to judge the voracity of those results, but those were the results. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The Communists were firmly in control which meant -- especially to us Jews who were so hungry for Western culture -- especially after the War having -- meaning from the free West, American movies, American books, American magazines, British films and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">For a while, for two years, ‘44, ‘45, part of ‘46, we were allowed to watch such movies and to have access to foreign books. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I remember being a member of the <span class="BUILDING">British Consul Library</span> and the small <span class="INT_SPACE">reading room</span> established by the Youth Information Agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">By ‘48, they had been abolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But suddenly in *47, one could not see a single American western movie 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or an important Western magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">That was very bothersome to us because it was such an infringement of the newly acquired freedom and a foretaste of things to come -- especially after the Communists had firmly established themselves in power. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And then news from other <span class="REGION">Eastern European countries</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> for example, the events, the death of Masaryk’? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">and the overthrow of the last truly democratic government there. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">A close friend of mine was the son of the Bulgarian Ambassador to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> during that time so I heard it firsthand as to what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That was in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I mention this because this fact plus the elections plus the events in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> with the passage of the Partition Resolution of the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> in -- was it November of ’47? </span><span class="sentence" id="578">All of these factors combined within the hearts and minds of Bulgarians Jews, and I felt, like anybody, else that the time to go has arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Now, with the return of the Communist Party to power, the return of Jewish property, which had started in 1944, was stopped and new laws expropriating all property from all Bulgarian citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, was taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So, we saw that in several respects we were even worse off than under the Fascists, under a new Communist legislation. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So the feeling was, “If a State of Israel 1s proclaimed, we should go as quickly as we can.” </span><span class="sentence" id="582">'S Jan Masaryk And indeed, that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">When the State of Israel was proclaimed in May of 1948, Bulgarian Jews by that time had organized themselves in every conceivable type of Zionist organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">The lists of potential immigrants were -- had already been drawn up. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So we were ready and the Bulgarian government received permission from the Soviet Union, just as the governments of other <span class="REGION">Eastern European countries</span> , to allow every Jew who wants to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I will not go into the rationale for this, for this Soviet policy, but obviously it had some very pragmatic reasons behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Now -- but to go a little bit back again to ’47, I became active again in Zionist organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I had decided that if I am given the chance to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , I would leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But in the meantime I had to think of the immediate future, and that was higher education. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">To qualify for admission to <span class="BUILDING">Sofia University</span> , or any other <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , unless you had very good Communist Party credentials, the only other thing that might give you a chance to be considered for admission was to volunteer for service in one of the many labor brigades organized by the government when the young people go to build <span class="DLF">roads</span> or a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> for children and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I participated in one such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which we toiled hard to build, but never came to pass, because it was just work for work's sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">It was just to say that you are doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So I joined a brigade like that and was unfortunate to have as my brigade commandant a Bulgarian Jewish Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">He made my life a misery, knowing that I am a Jew, and knowing that I am the son of a prominent lawyer, a non-Communist, somebody who was active during the War and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">It was obvious that that class struggle mentality was there as though we, the Jews were enemies of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">No Bulgarian Jew had ever exploited any other Bulgarian Jew in order to carry the class struggle to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But that was the ideological predilection of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So he gave me <span class="NPIP">hell</span> during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I remember that and I mention that for one reason: Later on by the time some of the Bulgarian Jewish Communists fell in disfavor with the Bulgarian authorities, especially after the Six Day War in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , this particular man immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And I saw him in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I ignored him, but others who had suffered under different circumstances gave him a sound beating there. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">If he is alive I wish him well in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  Let us take it to the point now. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">We have 10 minutes left on this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I would like to take it to the immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">You have brought us to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So, the -- from the vote on the Petition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in the fall of 1947, Bulgarian Jewry was freely aflame with Zionist fervor if I can say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I will never forget the manifestations. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Yeh, the march through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sofia</span> with, with lit candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I am trying to remember whether this was the night of the Partition Resolution or the date of the Proclamation of the State. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">No, I think it was the Proclamation of the State. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">That was something unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">In a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> already openly ruled by the Communist Party, a spontaneous demonstration, which really the authorities -- although they were officially very anti-Zionist, anti-Zionist with all the permission on the part of the Soviet Union for Jews to immigrate into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but the official policy was against Zionism because Stalin did not believe in Zionism -- but the Bulgarian authorities allowed us to march in support of the new State of Israel and it was very touching. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And you could see that all these people who are not allowed, or whose little demonstration on May 24, 1943 was crushed, were here marching freely in a Communist country in support of the newly born State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">A memorable evening!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Now already in, in late ‘47, a lot of Jews began immigrating to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , taking the risk of being stopped by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British ships</span> and diverted to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Even relatives of mine did that, and lived in -- on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> for almost, what -- seven months until the establishment of the State of Israel, when the <span class="DLF">borders</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So Bulgarian Jewish immigration began already in ‘47. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Primarily younger people but some young families as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">The mass aliyah’* -- the mass immigration, began really one day after the establishment of the State. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Already on May 16, Bulgarian Jews were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Of course, aliyah depended on the transportation capabilities of the young State. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Strangely enough within a few months, two major <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were already put at the disposal of Bulgarian Jews for immigration: The Pan York, the Pan Crescent. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I came on the -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on the Pan Crescent in December of 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Within a period of -- a period from let's say June of ‘48 through February, March of ‘49, all 48,000 or more of the surviving Bulgarian Jews -- obviously, they all survived World War Two -- immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">A very small number of Jews, either Communists or very old people, people who did not feel that transplanting themselves at that point in their lives would be advisable, stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And this in itself was amazing to see: an entire community which had lived for most of the time very peacefully and in prosperity almost 500 years among, in the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> , among Bulgarian Slavs, suddenly transplanting itself to the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> and starting a new life in the newly re-born State of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  What happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="630">What was your trip like? </span><span class="sentence" id="631">What was it like for you to arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Well, I together with a group of other boys, young Bulgarians, we registered knowing that we will be conscripted on arrival in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We knew that we would join the young army and that was our desire. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">That was December of ‘48, the time of the so-called second truce in the fighting in the War of Liberation of 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Well, excitement! </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Not knowing to what we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I had never been very, very sportsman-like or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I had no idea of how to hold a rifle, but I was prepared to go and so were some of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">On our way there, by this marvelous, newly-acquired <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pan Crescent</span> , which left the Yugoslavia port of Bar and also took a great number of Hungarian Jews '* Immigration of Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> (Hebrew) who had also come to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Of course we reached <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> from both <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a lengthy three day journey in tremendous cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But once on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , it was like a festival really of people who are free and are going to fight in a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">They don't know what expects them, but it was fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The spirits was very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I, who had never been really separated from my parents, I forgot all about my family and got carried away in this wave of enthusiasm. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Of course, reality has a way of denting enthusiasm of every kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">On arrival the prosaic reality of being picked up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transition military camp</span> , which was horrendous, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Jews -- young Jews from all over the world without the common language arriving there. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It was no fun, especially knowing that or not knowing exactly where they will send you and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Could we hold it a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We need to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">End Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  You have just arrived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with Jews from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Tell me what that period was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  It was exhilarating in some aspects, but very worrying in others. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">The reason being primarily that until we arrived there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I had not heard about the <span class="DLF">Gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Of two other groups of young Bulgarian Jews who had arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on previous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , and who apparently with a minimum of training, almost none, and with a minimum of arms had been sent on a particular day, on the afternoon as I understand it, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latrun</span> in so- called triangle between -- halfway between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , a very strategic place of tremendous importance in the attempts of the young State to stop the onslaught of the five Arab armies that had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">In this case, of course, the main threat was the Egyptian Army, and I think the purpose was not to allow them to make -- to break through it — Latrun -- in order to converge with other invading Arab armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Reinforcements apparently were not available. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Ben-Gurion’’, Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief at the time had to make a very, very fateful decision of using these young Bulgarian new arrivals almost as gun fodder by sending them there and trying to use them to just hold the <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> until proper reinforcement would arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Well, they did held the <span class="DLF">fort</span> ; Latrun was not lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">It was saved, but all of them lost their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Again, I may be mistaken, but I think the number reached 600. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Well, you can imagine to a 17 year old, when you are told all of this and obviously a fact that had happened several weeks prior to your own arrival in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , you really don't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">You don't have the benefit of your parents' counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">You listen to what the other guys tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">This guy was telling me, "Well, if you don't want to end up this way, try to somehow join the Air Force." </span><span class="sentence" id="667">He had, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I will not go into the details of how I managed to get into a force that was exclusively volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">There is a Hebrew word for that Mahal, a abbreviation for “Mitnadevei Hutz La’ Aretz,'°” “Volunteers from Overseas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But Mahal meant the people from English speaking or other affluent countries. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">All of us who came from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> were known as the category of Gahal, “Ge’us Hutz La’ Aretz,'” “Conscripted from Overseas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="672">We were conscripted, they were volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Well, some how with the help of the little English that I knew at that time, I did join the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I was privileged to be a member of the first course in the history of the Jewish people for radar technicians and I became one of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 's Air Force's first radio technicians using naval radar equipment for detecting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">But that part of it was very exciting being amongst so many young Jews from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And especially getting to know American and British and Australian English speaking young Jews, and see that: the depth of their commitment, of their volunteerism, of their Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I am bearing in '° David Ben-Gurion '® Foreign volunteers (Hebrew) '’ Foreign draftees (Hebrew) mind all the time that they came there out of choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Most of us came from <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> also out of deliberate Zionist choice, but we also at the back of my mind --of our minds, we had the lack of future under the Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But these young, young people did have a choice, and they still decided to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So, it was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The beginnings of a culture if you wish, cross-fertilization with other, with other parts of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">For us -- especially Bulgarian Jews who had been raised in the European Sephardic tradition with a very small Ashkenazi minority -- that was the first really contact with Jews that were different from us and we had to make a lot of cultural and emotional adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  Would you encapsulate now at this point and tell us what happened to you and to the Bulgarian community. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Where did they settle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  Yeh. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The Bulgarian community arrived at the ttme when the formerly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arab town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> , which is almost adjacent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , because of the flight of its inhabitants at the height of the fighting during the War of Liberation, was virtually empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The abandoned Arab property was put under the custodian of absentee property and was available for new immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So around the time that the Bulgarian aliyah immigration wave was at its height, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> was almost empty and open for resettlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And that is where I would say the majority of the Bulgarian Jews, at least 20 to 25,000 settled at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And pretty soon, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulgarian city</span> , with Bulgarian signs on <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> with Bulgarian translation on movies and began to thrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Very few Bulgarian Jews remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">immigration transition camps</span> , Mahanot Olim'*, in Hebrew, where people from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> sometimes stayed for two, three years before they could find their own way out and had to rely on the Jewish agency or government assistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Bulgarian Jews very quickly took care of themselves, primarily by settling in places like, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lydda</span> , another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arab town</span> , which population had fled the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ramla</span> , another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arab town</span> so these were newly created Bulgarian Jewish communities. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Very enterprising and self- reliant with, with many craftsmen and artisans and people of free professions like lawyers, engineers and doctors among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">The Bulgarians did very well for themselves, and after awhile began leaving those original <span class="REGION">areas</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ramla</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lydda</span> , and settling in the more affluent areas of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  When did you leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">What happened to you after the War?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  Well, my family arrived in February of ‘49. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">By that time I was already serving in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I had found them a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">My father, as I mentioned, had to make the very painful adjustment from being a prominent lawyer in his native language into -- and at that time, he didn't even know whether he would be able to practice again -- so what he did at first was just work anywhere, usually clerical jobs because he already knew some 'S immigrant camps (Hebrew) Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">But he also applied himself very, very devotedly and strenuously to studying not only the Hebrew language but taking the special courses that were devised for lawyers coming from overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He studied hard for three or four years and passed the Bar Examination, the special Bar Examination again, and at the age of 65 began practicing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So we settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">My mother had some money in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> from an inheritance from her father, who as I mentioned lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and at that time had the forethought of buying some property in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> which came in handy later. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">At first, I -- after completing my military service, I enrolled in the Haifa Technion, thinking as a majority of my friends did, that only a real trade will, will do in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and especially in my case, observing the tragedy of the readjustment of my father when you have a profession that relies on the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Well, I made the wrong choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It was very pragmatic, but I was not cut out for engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">After two years, I dropped out, began writing for the local Bulgarian -- for the Tel Aviv Bulgarian language daily, which was quite a necessary cultural and even absorption instrument for the Bulgarian, Bulgarian Jewry during the time since their arrival for the necessary five or six years until they cultural integrated into the life of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  You worked for them awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">How long did you live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and why did you come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  For 20 years, for 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I lived there for 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I graduated with a BA in political science from the Tel Aviv branch of the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> , which now 1s the <span class="BUILDING">Tel Aviv University</span> in -- my degree was in journalism and diplomacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I soon after graduating, I joined the staff of the U.S. Information Service at the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> as an Israeli citizen, a local employee. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Worked successfully for the U.S. Embassy for almost nine years in the capacity of Assistant Press Officer and editor of both English and Hebrew publications. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">That, combined with my studies of political science and diplomacy, developed in me the great desire to become a diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And I started knocking on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the Israel Foreign Ministry. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Unfortunately -- at the time I hope this practice has been abandoned -- the distribution of jobs of this foreign ministry was based on the so-called “party key.” </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Well, I did belong to the right party, Mapai'”. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">But that was the party of the majority and we Bulgarian Jews were not sufficiently a pressure group so as to justify giving me a job without attaining any particular or further any particular political interest because it was like preaching to the converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">They had our support. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Well, I stayed on with the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> , but after a trip to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as guest of the U.S. Government as some -- I think my well deserved training and orientation after almost seven years of service with USIA”’ -- when I was given a chance to visit coast to coast for three months and, and fall in love with a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that I had been selling to my fellow Israelis for the years prior to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I decided that, if given a chance, I  Mifleget Po’alei Eretz Israel [Labor Party of Israel] (Hebrew) United States Information Agency would like to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Especially after having taken part in three wars and having a five and a half year old son, whom I wanted, unlike me, to taste life especially in his formative years, in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , where at least the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> itself is not at war or is not the passage ground of occupying forces and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Of course, the Vietnam War was raging, but the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> itself -- the territorial United States was at peace, and I knew that by the time he grew up, that war at least would be taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So it was my own fatigue with living for survival’s sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">War after war, adjustment after adjustment, politics determining my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I was sick and tired of that, and this coupled with my desire to allow my son to taste something different from what I had gone through, and the fact that I fell in love with this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when I visited it extensively in the spring of ’67. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And when the chance presented itself that I was offered the position at the <span class="BUILDING">Hoover Institution</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span> *’, I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">But I was very honest with myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I did not come here just to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I obtained release from the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">As an immigrant, I took immigrant visas for myself and for my former wife by using respectively the Bulgarian and the Polish quotas, I left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to which I had gone to participate in its War of Liberation somewhat discouraged, I must admit. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Disillusionment, of course, but disillusioned was more my problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">It's when you raise too many unrealistic expectations about people or <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , you're bound to be disillusioned if they don't live up in real life to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But it was more my lack of faith or lack of ability to see down the <span class="DLF">road</span> what would happen in that part of the world in terms of peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And I thought that I owed it to myself before beginning the down slope ride in terms of age, at least a chance to see the world from a perspective of non-involvement, at least immediate non-involvement, in such events as continuing warfare and living in a -- just a struggle for mere survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I wanted to give myself this chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Of course, I could remain deeply interested in the State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">My entire family lives there, sister, aunts, cousins and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I have a tremendous stake in the survival of that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I would do gladly anything to further the cause of peace because I think that only through some political accommodation in peace will the future of that small and beloved <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> be assured.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">With that note, we shall end it. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And I thank you very much.</span></p>
