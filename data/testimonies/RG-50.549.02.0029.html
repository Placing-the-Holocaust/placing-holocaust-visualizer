ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Okay, now, Dr. Chameides, I -- I’d like to start a little bit -- just before the period that we -- we were planning to begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Just at those -- those last days that you recall before liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Did you have an anticipation that something was -- was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">What- Do you recall what your feelings were at thas -- that time just before -- Just before liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I think, first of all, I have to emphasize the fact that in 1944, I was nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I had been away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a little over two years, since August of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And if you remember your feelings at nine years of age, it’s very difficult to separate out, and to recall exactly what one’s feelings were at that time and what occurred later and I’m very - always very careful not to read in things that occurred later and attribute them to that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> by the name of Univ, which is near the large city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , now in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Univ</span> was very close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzyce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">But I was hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Univ monastery</span> was the mother monastery of the stunite monks of the <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian Catholic Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I was, by that time, a Greek Catholic in my -- in my approach really, but with fairly vivid feelings and recollections of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And we, of course, knew that things were happening, because the front was coming closer and closer to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">There were the tremendous amount of warfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The Ukrainian partisans were fighting on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> and then saw that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was going to lose and there was a lot of confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So a lot of the village people were involved in the fighting, and the fighting -- the front came close and closer to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We could hear it, we could see it’s effects. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I’m not sure that I had any feeling in terms of that I was going to be liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was -- There was a certain amount of excitement in the -- in a war coming, but of course we had been through this so many times before, that the issue then was primarily how to survive and how to get the next meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I think those were much more of immediate concern to us -- or to me, at least, than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">For reasons I’m not clear, we had one healer, I don't know whether he was a physician or not, but one person who knew something about medicine in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , that I managed to become his helper at the ripe age of nine and we set up a -- a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and we brought in -- the wounded were brought in from the -- and one of my jobs -- course, we had no medicines at all, and one of my jobs was after the battles, to run into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and to rummage around, find dead soldiers, particularly if they were German, because they would usually have bandages and first aid material on them, and get as much of that material as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">If they were bandaged -- their wounds were bandaged, I would take the wou -- bandages off and then run back and wash them, so we could use them on the -- on the Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">This helped me a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It taught me a lot and also, it -- it helped me because on Sundays, the farmers, the families would come and then -- and they would -- to see their husbands and youngsters and -- and I would always be around and so I would get eggs and cheese and milk and so there was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So, we knew something was coming, the front was coming closer to us, the bombardments were more common. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">One heard a lot of shooting a-around and so we knew something big was -- was about to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then, a-a-appreciating the fact that you were nine and that you’re not going -- going to recall, of course, all the details or even, you know, looking back at -- those number of years to exactly what you were feeling at the time, and appreciating that fact that you don’t want to reconstruct something, as you just said, what do you recall about those actual first moments of realizing that something was really changing now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Well, unfortunately for us, again, in my position, not that much changed, because when the Russians entered, I was on the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span> , because almost as soon as the Russians entered, which as I recall was in June of 1944, Stalin, as you recall, was a firm opponent of the <span class="BUILDING">Greek Catholic Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The <span class="BUILDING">Greek Catholic Church</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">nationalist church</span> , 1t was very much bound up with Ukrainian nationalism and with a drive for independence on the part of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , from the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And so Stalin, who eventually outlawed the <span class="BUILDING">Greek Catholic Church</span> , imme -- almost immediately began persecuting the priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And so, we would see now, instead of Jews being shot, we would see priests being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And so, one day, I had heard that there was a -- a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> going to be going to the big city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and I felt that I had to get out of Univ and so I took one of the younger boys, who is now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">His name now is Oded Amarand, but at that time, his name was Dodo, and we decided we would walk to this nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- I have no 1-idea of how much of a distance that was, in order to try to get this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and on the way, we were stopped by Russian soldiers a-and a Russian patrol stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And children were very often used as spies, so we were highly suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And I remember sitting in, behind a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bush</span> , crouched with my arms up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> as this Russian was standing in front of us, not knowing -- with a tommy gun -- not knowing what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I talked them into allowing us to go to a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and -- which he did, and eventually he let us go back to Univ. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">A- And then, it was I think several weeks before another horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> was going -- this time I think from <span class="BUILDING">Univ</span> , if I recall correctly, and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , which is a ridiculously small distance when covered by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but is incredibly lengthy by horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I was able to get on that and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">mother church</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Yura</span> -- which is the Ukrainian for Saint George, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Yura</span> , and I don’t know how long I was there at this time, I don’t get the impression it was a long time, but I really don’t have a good concept of time, it could have been weeks, or might have been months, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But 1-it was during the morning mass that I remember, which was celebrated by Brat Yosef, Brother Joseph was his name, I remember the way he looked, a bald head with a white beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And he was celebrating the mass and in the middle of the mass, in walked two boys who were dressed differently than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But the dress and their faces were familiar to me, but I wasn’t sure from where. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I was dressed at the time in pants made of burlap, because we had nothing, and shoes made of -- of wood, soles made of wood, because there was no leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And here come these two boys, who are already better dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They’re in short pants, in a western style, better material. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And that was -- one of the boys was my brother and the other one was a young man who is now a chemist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And they motioned to me and -- and I went with them and I remember going to have something to eat first, because we didn’t eat before mass and so we had something to eat and -- and they took me out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So -- So that’s how I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  When did you realize that that was your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  I -- I think -- I think I realized almost immediately, but I wasn’t a hundred percent certain. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I hadn’t seen him in a -- two and a half years and at that age, there’s a big change that occurs in -- in people. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But I -- I think I realized almost immediately that it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Cause I had thought about him a great deal while I was in hiding and the -- the Studite monks made a tremendous effort to always keep us separated, because they were afraid that if we were ever together, we would not only give each other away, but they were in mortal danger themselves, because they were really -- would -- would have been killed had it been known they were hiding Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So -- And I remember once, I was in Univ, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I found a pair of pants that I was absolutely certain were his and that were hidden there, but I’m -- I’m not sure the --
QUESTION:  Do you recall when you finally realized and when you did, you know, connect with him? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Do you -- Do you -- Do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Was it -- Was it sa -- Was there enough tension so that the -- the reunion wasn’t particularly joyful at the -- at that moment or d- do you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  You know, I don’t, and I honestly don’t remember emotions very well and -- and again, you know, we had been through so many eventful days and so many eventful months and years, that it seemed like I was almost numb and that nothing surprised me, so here it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I mean, I -- I don’t -- unless I don’t remember correctly, which is also possible, but I do not recall a particularly strong emotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  That makes me wonder whether, I mean, especially with children and you see children nowadays in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , for example, whether they -- di-di-did you have an idea that this was not normal, what you were going through, or did you just think this is what hap -- not that you would have consciously thought, but did -- do you recall if you would have thought, “This is not normal, this is not supposed to be happening?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  I -- I don’t think I had -- I don’t think I had sophisticated thoughts of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I -- I think clearly, you know, at -- at least at the very beginning, I missed my parents tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was terribly scared a good portion of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But -- But the immediate things were hunger, were -- were loneliness, were trying to make sure that one didn’t give oneself away by either saying one was Jewish -- we were particularly marked because it - we were in a society where only Jews were circumcised, so I was always -- I had to be very, very careful, never go -- to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> when other boys were there, never to bathe together. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So, I was always conscious -- so it was this type of peculiar thing, where on the one hand, you know, I followed the ritual of -- of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , on the other hand, I -- there was a conscious part of me, because I had to be conscious in order not to give myself away. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But, I think children have an incredible capacity to adapt and -- and I think only those who adapted remained alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I think those who didn’t adapt or couldn’t adapt, didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, in a way, there’s already a group that’s -- there’s a selection process there. [</span><span class="sentence" id="68">sneezes]
QUESTION:  Bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  So, what you’re describing, in terms of -- whereas for some people in -- in other parts of Europe, there -- there was a liberation, there was a sense that, you know, this chapter is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But in -- What you’re describing is -- is at least up -- up through parts of 1946, exchanged one oppressor for another, such --
ANSWER:  Well, not through *46, because this was -- we did not stay under the Russians til ‘46, so -- so th -- what I’m describing now, is the immediate liberation by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And again, you know, I think every person, of course, is different and -- and adapts differently, but also, I think the age makes a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I notice, for instance, people who were just a few years older than I, had different reactions than I did, because they -- I think you develop a sense of perspective and -- and -- and knowledge of the world, which, I think at the age of seven, or even nine, y-you just don’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So, y-you have a different, you know -- you may develop the skills for survival and the skills for turning yourself into someone else and pretending to be someone else, but -- but -- but you can’t put that into a perspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, I mean, to me it was very confusing, because my native language, my mother tongue was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And -- And as I was a youngster, that was the height of culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So -- So wh-when the German invasion came in, I thought this was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Now, I'll be able to speak my language. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So, you know, I was naive, I didn’t know anything about the persecutions which had already -- I didn’t know much about Hitler or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I was in a different age frame and I had a different, you know, perspective on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  I guess the reason I -- I mentioned ‘46 was not necessarily that it was going to be continuous oppression for you, but the events of -- I guess it was June ‘46, and the rampages in -- was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kilsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Kelsen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Kelsen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Well, I was already out of <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We, just to go back a little bit, after I was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , we went to -- the person who was responsible for even knowing that we were in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> was Rabbi David Kahana, who became the chief Rabbi of the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And he himself and his wife and two children were hidden in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He as a priest, his wife as a nun. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He wrote a book called, “The Lvov Ghetto Diary.” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he was a -- He was good friends with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And, in fact, the two of them went to metropolish -- metropolithishipditsky together, which eventually led to th -- him hiding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, he knew of our whereabouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He also knew that our parents didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And so he made it his business to make sure that we were taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , whereas, as you know, there were children, including a good friend of mine who was with me in Univ, whose parents not survive, who simply no one knew that they were there and they were just left there, and then became the object of a lot of post-war court cases for the community to try to get some of these children back. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So, we went with my brother and -- and Nathan, who was the other boy, to Rabbi Kahana, and Rabbi Kahana told us at that point that our parents had perished and he had a -- a little note that my mother had written, which she gave to him for safekeeping, which he gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And then the question was, “Do you know what to do with us?” </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was nine, my brother was 11 and a half and my brother had been placed with a family who had survived the war and there was a husband, wife and the young son of his age and they were willing to take him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And they knew of a woman by the name of Tolla Wasserman -- her maiden name was Ashkenazi, who had been born in 1909, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and who had gone through the war, was hidden by her maid, she had a Polish maid who was able to cordon off one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , very much like Anne Frank’s thing, and they remained there for 18 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And so she was the only one in the family who survived, she was alone and Mr. and Mrs. Frost, who were the people that my brother was staying with -- and went to her and asked her whether she would be willing to take me in, and she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My brother did not remain with the Frosts, he -- he had a lot of difficulty in becoming a part of any new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at all, and -- and left, but I remained with -- with Tolla Wasserman from 1944, I believe November, until her death in 1964. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And, it was really, I think a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I think, thanks to her that Iam where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So --
QUESTION:  Why do you think that -- wa-was it the age difference th-that made it so difficult for your brother, whereas it was possible for you to adapt, even thought it’s only two and a half years? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Perhaps a significant time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You know, one of the difficulties we always have in -- in trying to ascribe any reasons for anything, is that we have no controls. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I don’t know what would have happened to me had I been his age. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I think part of 1t was age, but I don’t think it was all age. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I think I have had, since then, and -- and before, a tremendous ability to adapt to reality, which served me well, so I think part of it may have been age, but I don’t think all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I think part of it has to do with personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, when you -- I want to ask you to back up just a moment, when you learned of your parents death, was this something that you were almost anticipating learning, or were you shocked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  No, I -- I was not shocked and I would have been, I think shocked had I learned otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It -- It came as a -- when I think back on it in a very, almost unemotional matter of fact issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Everyone was dead, I mean it’s much more shocking to me now, looking back, than it was at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Perhaps that was a protective mechanism, but I didn’t -- I don’t remember, either shock or sadness, or any type of real feeling about it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It’s much more painful to me now than it was then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Do you -- Do you recall at all, what your actual reaction was when you learned? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">What you said, what you --
ANSWER:  I -- I don’t recall, but I -- I don’t -- I mean, I remember being in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I remember being told, and I simply don’t remember any reaction at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I -- I had -- I don’t- didn’t have any reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Do you f -- Did you feel that living with -- with Tolla Wasserman was -- was like being in a new family, being 1n a real family, or how did -- how did you feel about her, and --
ANSWER:  Yeah, well, we -- we became very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I started by calling her Chacha, which is the Polish word for aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And within a few weeks, I asked her whether I could call her mother, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, we became very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And she had no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">She was a wonderful, wonderful human being, and so I was part of her family, although there was her -- she had lost her husband and lost her family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So, did you live in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> together or to --
ANSWER:  Well, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , if you remember, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin met at the <span class="DLF">altar</span> and divided th-the <span class="REGION">eastern sphere</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> was given to the Soviet Union when the map of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was redrawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Part of that agreement allowed former Polish citizens to choose whether they wanted to remain there or to move into the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and of course, our intent was to move westward. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So, I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> on -- in <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> and I did have some education in -- in -- during the war, in Univ, but not a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, I think it was the first time that I really went to an organized <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then we were given the opportunity to -- to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">western Lvov</span> -- to <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We went there sometime in 19 -- I believe it was in the spring of ‘45 and we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Those were -- The only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> available were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And there were horrendous stories be -- circulating, of people who had gone before, who would be going on open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , a distance that before the war used to take maybe two or three hours to cover by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , taking two and three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And the Russians would simply stop in the- in <span class="DLF">fields</span> and then -- and just refuse to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And there seemed to be no schedule, there was no control. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Th-The war was still going on and -- and people were freezing to death in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So there was a lot of fear about going on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , but we were very lucky for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">One is that Tolla Wasserman, my new mother, had befriended a person - a doctor and each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had a -- one covered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , which had a Red Cross on it and he suggested that we go in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , so we had covering. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And the second thing he did was, he bought, at enormous expense, a -- a bottle of -- a -- a case of vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the first day we were out, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and he called the engineer into this covered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  Okay, continuing now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He took a bottle of vodka out, showed it to the engineer and then heaved it out the open <span class="DLF">door</span> , and it shattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And the engineer showed his anguish and he said, “I want you to know that every morning, I’m going to take a bottle and I’m going to throw it out the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Whatever is left in that case when we get to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , is yours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And we got there in two and a half days, which is absolutely amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So that’s how we got there, but now that I think back on it, we celebrated the end of the European war, VE Day, while still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , because I remember, we were living at that time on -- in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on 15 <span class="DLF">Mawitskago Street</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was deemed too large for just my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So they billeted a whole slew of Russian soldiers with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And many of the soldiers were wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was a -- an elderly gentleman who was the father of one of the younger soldiers and then there were other young soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Many of them had lost arms, lost legs and therefore they were taken from the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And they had bought a case of vodka and mother said, “No, you’re not going to get drunk here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And she locked up the vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And then they said, “No, no, we’re going to celebrate, because it’s the end of the war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And she said, “I don’t believe you, but if it’s really the end of the war, I will buy you another case.” </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So, we went out to the main square, because no one had radios, we went out to the main square and after awhile, Stalin came on the loudspeaker and -- and announced the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So the -- I think that was VE Day, so we were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">During that time also, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , as I mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I also worked after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">cosmetics store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I remember Russian soldiers used to come in and they would buy five bottles of Eau de Cologne and they would hit it against something, take off the tops and drink -- drink that down. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They’d drink anything that had any kind of alcohol content in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I was at that time already, very cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My hair had grown back, and mother made sure that I was always dressed meticulously. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And so, I reminded many of them of their own children, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So they would very often come to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and after buying something, they would ask me to come with them for a walk or to come and drink beer. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> by the name of <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Georges</span> , and they used to take me to <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Georges</span> to drink beer. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And then I would always go with them, and --
QUESTION:  This would have been ‘40 --
ANSWER:  This was ‘44, beginning of °45, really ‘45, and I would go with them and on one occasion we were coming back and there was a street photographer and so he took a pho- they asked to stop, and they took three photographs and one of those photographs of me and two Russian soldiers is hanging on my <span class="DLF">wall</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Often wondered where the oth -- soldiers are. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And then, the other thing that used to happen to me again, to show you the adaptability, is that the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> was the only way you could make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">You couldn’t make a living any other way, so everyone was Black Marketeering. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> at that time consisted of soldiers who were stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , bringing stuff back from the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They would bring stuff back from the British or the Americans, who would barter for -- for stuff, and then they’d come back and sell it and then we would sell it further. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And one of the big 1tems was, for some reason or other, mother of pearl buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So we used to get a lot of mother of pearl buttons in the <span class="BUILDING">cosmetic store</span> , which was a state run store and those would be held under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> and then people would come in who knew about it and would buy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And whenever there was a raid or anyone would come, they very often would put the mother of pearl under my shirt, around me, because the soldiers were less likely to search children. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And -- So I would find myself with mother of pearl buttons on a -- sewn on a -- on material wound around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And one day they found it on me and they -- they took me to the Encoverdare, as the NVD was at that time called, <span class="BUILDING">Encoverdare headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Mother came with me, she was very shocked and -- and she of course knew about it, but she was shocked that I was taken in. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We went both. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And no idea what was going to happen to us and the Encoverdare officer closes the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind him and -- as we’re shaking, and turns to us and -- and -- and says in Russian, “Veehad sheety zheets, yatazhoy.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="181">You want to live, I also do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And so he became part of the smuggling ring after that and he got a cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So -- So that’s what life was like, you -- you adapted to -- there was one other episode that I remember from those days, and that was that the elderly gentleman I told you about, the Russian soldier, yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I don’t know when I say elderly, what I really mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He probably was 40, but to me he was elderly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  It’s amazing how our perspective changes with the years, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Right, and -- and one of them was -- one of the young men was his son and I remember one day, it was the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur -- I -- I had no idea it was Yom Kippur, because I had just come out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I -- I had brought from the -- from the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> with me, and -- my clothes that I wore and three items. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I brought my rosary, I brought my prayer book and I brought a blanket with which I covered myself during the two years and I learned never to give up that blanket, because that was the only thing that stood between me and the Ukrainian winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Somewhere, the rosary and the prayer book got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">My very strong suspicion 1s that Mother threw them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But I’m not certain of that and maybe it’s unfair to accuse her of that, but I suspect that. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But my -- Oh, no, there was a fourth item I brought with me, and that was a picture of myself in front of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , which I still have, but, the blanket I still have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  You still have the blanket?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  I still have the blanket.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  How do you look at the blanket now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Well, again, it’s taken on more meaning as I’ve gotten older. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And we just had a grandson and we used -- we used that blanket during his circumcision. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So -- where was I, where was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Oh, I know wh-why I was telling you this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  C-Could I interrupt for a moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  Anyway, please continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  So, the reason I was telling you this in a roundabout way is because of this old -- probably 40 year old gentleman who had came to Yom Kippur, to the Day of Atonement and as I said, I didn’t know that, because Mother was really not very observant -- religiously observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So, we didn’t celebrate that at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But, he came to me and he asked me if I would stand at the <span class="DLF">door</span> -- at the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> and look out and warn him if his sons or any of his friends came. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I said, “Why do you want me to do that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And he said, “Because I’d like to say some prayers, but I’m afraid that they might turn me in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Because in the atheistic system in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , that wasn’t allowed and he was afraid of his own son, that he would turn him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">That made a big impression on me and I remember it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The reason I mention this, 1s that -- is that I think another thing that I was very fortunate in was that I wasn’t thrown immediately from one religious experience into another. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">If I had been, my suspicion is that I would have rebelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But, as I mentioned, Mother was not particularly a religious woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">On the other hand, she took a tremendous -- she had a sense of responsibility which she took very seriously, to make sure that I was brought up in a religious atmosphere, because my father had been the rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> and she felt an obligation to bring me up in the way they would have wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And so I did, later on, but I’m getting ahead of myself, go in to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But at that time, as I think back on it, it was very -- I was very fortunate not to have been thrown into a religious environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  So -- Well, in -- in the -- in describing the -- the stran -- this rather rapid <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, d- due to the strategy of -- just jumping ahead again here --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  -- we’re talking about the end of 1945, in that period, beginning of ‘46?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Well, ‘40, no it was probably the middle -- was -- I don’t remember, was VE Day in May ‘45? </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I think --
QUESTION:  I don’t remember the day [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I believe it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And -- And that we still had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , so it was probably in -- somewhere in the -- and I remember going -- it was in the spring that we went, so it was probably the end of May of ‘45 that we went westward. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we went to was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> is in <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> and actually is just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram car</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> ’s ride away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So I came back to where I had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And in fact, I had had relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> who -- who had lived, before the war, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> , were very wealthy people, owned a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> there, but none of them survived, all the descendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> because the other family that I had mentioned, the Frosts, with whom my brother was still -- he was still with them at that time, had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> , and -- and so we went there thinking we would try to settle there, at least for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The idea always was to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Mother had actually registered to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> before the war, but her number hadn’t come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So she was still hopeful that she was in <span class="DLF">line</span> , in terms of the numbers and that eventually that number would come up and that we would be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> and I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but it became dangerous -- not became, but it still was dangerous for Jews to be identified as Jews and the Kelsa program is of course, one manifestation which occurred later, but one manifestation of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So, 1-it wasn’t good to be a Greek Catholic, which would have been natural, because we were now in <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> now, and -- as a Roman Catholic and my name became Leslef Kusharetsky, because it was impo -- for me to have told anyone I was Jewish, would have been very bad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So -- So I became a Roman Catholic at this time, not that I was baptized or anything, but as far as my schoolmates were concerned, and my name was Leslef Kusharetsky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Now, did you have any experiences, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> or in your new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">You -- You mentioned you -- you ha -- you were faced with having to deny your identity and change your name, which is obviously a -- a drastic and a necessary thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But did you -- did you -- were there times where you experienced personally, anti-Semitism in the post- war period in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> yourself, or -- how else did you see it? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Was it just all around you, what -- what’s happened in <span class="NPIP">places</span> --
ANSWER:  You know, anti-Semitism is -- is very relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We had just gone through the worst anti-Semitism there 1s, where we saw people being dragged through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> by their beards and shot and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So, anything that occurred, the fact that someone would throw a stone at -- would call a name, was so minuscule. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So, you know, the Russians to us, were the liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They were our friends, they were the people who defeated Hitler and so there was enormous amount of -- you know, they evoked a positive image 1n our minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There was a lot of anti-Semitism around, but it was -- it was a -- it was as natural as breathing and it was so minuscule compared to what had just happened that it really was insignificant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  It did-didn’t reach you --
ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  -- in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I remember reading in one o -- some of the literature, I don’t know if it was from the encyclopedia of the Holocaust or where, but there was reference to the -- the sentiment just among the citizenry in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that u-upon greeting a Jew, somebody would often say, “Oh, I thought -- I thought the -- the Germans got rid of you all,” or something to --
ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Was -- Was it -- Wh-What -- Was the atmosphere on that level of -- of hatred --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  -- and dehumanization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Absolutely, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But again, you know, it’s -- it’s -- it -- one should not generalize. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">There were good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And -- But -- But there was hatred and there was -- and -- and you know the fear? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Don’t forget that a lot of the Poles were living in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> and eating from Jewish dishes and their fear was someone was going to come back and reclaim it. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">A-And the fear toda -- to this day is someone’s going to come back and reclaim it. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So, you know, th-there was a lot of anti-Semitism, but again, relative to what we had gone through, it was quite mild.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  So then, you’re -- you’re -- by mid -- middle of the year in ‘45, you’re now in <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> , and -- and how long did you stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Well, we -- we -- again, we had difficulty making a living and -- and one of the things that everyone was doing was buying and selling and you’d go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and you would stand a-and you would see something -- with a few do -- few zlotys, and you would see something and you’d buy it and then you’d move two steps further and you’d try to sell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And I remember one amusing incident was that we once bought what we thought was a lovely pair of shoes for very little money and when we looked at our most magnificent find, we found that we had been sold two left shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And here we were, having spent a fair amount of whatever we had on these shoes, hoping to make a good profit and here we had two left shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So, the question then was, how could we sell two left shoes? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And the feeling was that a child would more likely get away with it than an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So my brother ended up selling the two left shoes to some other poor sucker, who thought he or she had gotten a bargain. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But that’s the way life went, you know and -- and- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But the -- What happened next is that my mother’s parents had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and managed to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1938 and go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And their son and dau -- two daughters, also were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , s -- and my uncle, their son, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> on Thames and in -- immediately at the end of the war, they began making inquiries about our family and found out that the children had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So they petitioned the religious council of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , th-the chief rabbi at that time was Rabbi Hertz, to try to get us to rejoin them. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And there was a Rabbi Solomon Shunfeld, who was a strikingly handsome gentleman, with a red beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">He worked for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> at that point -- for the UNRRA, the relief organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He fashioned himself a uniform, which was a British uniform with a -- with a leather strap across his chest and -- and looked very, very elegant. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And he basically made trips on behalf of the religious -- the chief rabbi’s religious council of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in order to find Jews who had survived, to help them, to try to get children and see whether he could transport them to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , get permission, and they were able to get a certain number of visas from the British government. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And so my uncle approached them to find us and -- and he in fact did and I remember when he came to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> -- and that was in 1945, probably mid or late ‘45, to inform us that we had grandparents and uncle and two aunts and that they were anxious to get us to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And my brother said, “Great.” </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And I said, “I won’t go without Mother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And they had no permission for a visa for an adult, to they had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They wired my uncle and my uncle said he wasn’t ready to bring anyone else, but he wanted us, so they tried again. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I told him in no uncertain terms that there 1s absolutely no way in which they will get me into any kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> alive, and -- to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So, he wired back saying that he would not participate -- he would not do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And finally they got a visa for Mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So, in the very end of 1945, I think it was December the 31st, of 1945, we left -- well, we first went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittum</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , stayed with Rabbi Kahana, who was -- then lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and every day we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , because we now had permission to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and every day we would be told that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were not flying because it was too foggy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Was this true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  And this wa -- yes, absolutely, because at that time, radar was in it’s infancy and -- and these were Royal Air Force planes, which were basically <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop transports</span> , they weren’t commercial -- you know, they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">canvas seats</span> and they basically transported troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But they were willing to transport us. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And -- So, for about two weeks, there became a standing joke, we would go in the morning to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , we’d be back in the afternoon and then finally one day we went and we took off and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , where we were met by my aunt, and then took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And we remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> for the next -- well, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for three and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Oh, when we -- originally they gave us a visa which was valid for one month’s visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But our Polish passport, which I still had, states that it’s valid only one way, so, I’m not sure how that worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But when we came to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , the official said to us, “You only want to visit <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for one month?” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And we said, “Well, we’d like to visit for a lot more, but we’re only allowed one month.” </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So he crossed out one month and he put three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I still have that document. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And so every three months, we had to renew our stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we did that for three and a half years, until our number came up to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So this was now 1946, I was 11 years old and I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> , and started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and I didn’t know a word of English and I had to learn another language and then --
QUESTION:  Which would have been your -- how many languages now, by the --
ANSWER:  Well, my native was -- was German and then Polish and then of course during the war, Ukrainian and then after the war, Russian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Ukrainian and Russian are quite similar?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Very. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They’re both Slavic language, but -- and they’re both written in a Cyrillic alphabet, but they’re are significant differences between the two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  So you -- you were at your fifth language by 11 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  So -- Right, so I had to learn English and unfortunately <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> had a terrible system at that time, which they have since done away with. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And that is that they had an exam called the elevenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">When you were eleven years old, you took an exam and if you passed it, if you got above a certain grade, you were destined to go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And if you got below a certain grade, you were destined to finish your education at the age of 14 and to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I arrived there just before my 11th birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And so, I took my elevenses, not knowing how to read one word, and of course got zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And so, I was placed in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that would have ended at the age of 14, in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But, again, Mother had other ideas and -- and in 1948, she left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> with me and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and she got a job as a maid in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on <span class="DLF">Goldessgreen Road</span> and enrolled me in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish secondary school</span> , because you could avoid that whole system if you went into a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And so from ‘48 to ‘49, I went for the first time, to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and got a little bit of a beginnings of a Jewish education at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Let me ask you, as -- as we’re moving forward in time and -- and it -- and it’s getting a little bit further away from the horribly traumatic experiences that you’d had during the war, and you’re getting older at the same time, at this point are you beginning to feel certain things, remember certain things, realize the -- the depth of -- of tragedy of what had happened to your family and -- and -- and to you personally, or -- or was this -- or were you just sort of going on in life and moving forward and you’re living another life and going ahead?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  I think a little bit of both. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I think, you know, our world was a world which was not normal, because the people, all of our acquaintances were refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">People who -- who had been lawyers and professors in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and now were doormen and -- and -- and janitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It was a world in which the topic of conversation was dominated by what was and what was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So it -- So that was always, I think cloud that -- that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Whenever -- I don’t remember one day that it, you know, became, but certainly, as I think back on my teenage years in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and so on and later on, I never was the same as other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I could never let myself go, I was always separated, by my own volition. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I could never participate in -- in something pleasurable for it’s own sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It had to have an ulterior purpose, it had to have -- there was always that serious element to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  To have a certain usefulness?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  It had to have a certain usefulness, I had to -- I was constantly aware that I had a responsibility, that my life wasn’t fully my own, that I had to fulfill certain responsibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">At the same time, I must tell you also, that it -- 1t -- my past experiences have been of enormous help to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And no matter what crisis I faced afterwards, I would always say to myself, “Well, there’s nothing to this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It’s a piece of cake, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So -- So, from that point of view, everything always compared itself and -- and so from -- so it was helpful, but there’s no -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  Well, you were talking about how -- how this has been helpful for you to be able to tap into -- tap into this knowledge that, you know, everything that’s a challenge from now on, is nothing, compared to what you’ve been through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think that everything always gets compared to that and no matter what crisis may arise, it -- it pales to insignificance when compared to what one has already been through, so you can always say to yourself, “Well, if I’ve gone through the worst, I can get through this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And -- And so no crisis seemed as great, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Now you’re -- you were just mentioning that you felt -- now, if you’re getting into °48 and ‘49, you’re 13 - 14 years old, a -- a sense 0-o-of -- of not being able to do something fun for fun’s sake, or joyful for joyfulness’ sake, that you had a sense of responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">What -- What was that responsibility to? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Was it to a thing, to an idea, to a person, to yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">What was it to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  Well, I am not sure that I articulated it that carefully at that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I can only talk about the results. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Obviously, I’ve articulated it more clearly in my mind since then, but to be fair about it, at that age, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But again, to get -- Ill get back to your question in a minute, but to get back to those days when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish secondary school</span> , to the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , I lived in a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> -- and this was from ‘48 to ‘49, and every youngster in that <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> that I lived in, was a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And every -- just about every youngster was without parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And so it was a -- again, a peculiar atmosphere that one was in, so the -- the -- the thing continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">You’re never very far from it and w-was during wa -- those years that one of my -- my very first girlfriend that I had a crush on, unfortunately committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And so there were people with a lot of problems, a lot of unhappiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Despair --
ANSWER:  And I was very fortunate among them, because I had -- I had an anchor, which they did not, which -- which was of tremendous help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  What -- What -- What do you recall about when this girl took her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Your -- Your own feelings -- was it -- was it -- was it despair for her, just utter despair? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Or do you --
ANSWER:  I -- I think it was despair for her and -- and as far as my own feelings, I was, of course, very sad to lose a friend and sad that it occurred at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But my attitude was, if that’s what she needed to do, that’s what she needed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And it wasn’t -- a-again, you know, coming from an environment so surrounded by death, it -- it -- it -- 1t was one more and the -- the war didn’t end in 1945, it continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And it continued to claim it’s victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  So this anchor for you is just so -- just so important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Was terribly important, and again, as I said before, I attribute all of my good fortune to that and then what I’ve been able to do, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But you asked me before, in terms of -- of responsibility to whom, and of course, that, I think, probably changes as your age changes and as your perspective changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I don’t think you make a decision for life and then you stick with it, I think it -- it changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But it was always a sense of responsibility, but I owed it to Mother, I owed to make something of myself, it was never th -- 1t was unthinkable that I would not achieve something, 1n some <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So I had that responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I felt a -- a very keen sense of responsibility to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I felt that when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I felt I needed to delve more into -- into Jewish learning, in order to learn what motivated them and -- and it became important for me to have children and grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Did you, at any point, feel -- in talking to -- to other people, I’ve heard before and there’s a -- you know th-they use the terminology which I th-think sometimes it -- you boil things down to -- to too simplistic when you use terms that people use, term survivors guilt or the sense that wh-why, you know, I’ve talked to people, why did I survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Even if you can intellectually understand the circumstances in which you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Was there any of that, or -- or -- a-as you -- as you looked at it? </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I ma -- I’m not- I’m not hearing you say that, but I’m wondering whether you sa -- had a sense of like, how could all these other people perish and -- and -- and I’m here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  Well, there is that question in terms of what makes the world go around and -- and the how come and tha -- there no -- no question that these questions occur to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I’ve never interpreted these as being guilt, certainly it -- 1t could be, that on unconscious level, there is guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But P’ve never felt, on a conscious level, particularly guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I felt -- I felt blessed and lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But I don’t think -- I don’t think guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I don’t -- I don’t feel that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  So, well, there are so many -- so many strains of your story, that --
ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  -- that -- that are so fascinating and -- and -- and powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Guess I’d like to ask you to go back now to -- we’re in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , right, in -- in “48 - ‘49, yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  ‘48 - ‘49, right, we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> in “40 -- yeah, ‘48.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  And what’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Wh-What do you remember from it? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">You’re getting to be a teenager now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Well, I didn’t take that much advantage of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You know, it’s of course, a wonderful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we did go to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and so on as a -- on school outings, but Mother, as I mentioned, worked as a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Worked for a family by the name of Bodner, on <span class="DLF">Goldessgreen Road</span> and -- and she was constantly working, so she had no time and -- and certainly no extra money to do anything with and she spent on my schooling and whatever extras. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But we would go to the movies and so on, but most of my life revolved around the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> where I lived and taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and coming from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and doing homework and the usual types of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We -- At that time, we still had ration books in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and I remember people were always complaining about the rationing of food and -- and -- and to us, when I say to us, I mean in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> and so on, we always thought it was rather amusing, because we thought that th-this wasn’t a shortage, this wasn’t deprivation in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But -- But we did have ration books and -- and yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Ah, well --
QUESTION:  [indecipherable] terms of the procedure as well as the feeling of -- of waiting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Well, it was a -- a being in limbo, basically, and -- and not being able to get on with your life, because every three months you had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Home Office</span> and plead for another three months extension of your visa, or another six months extension of your visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Mother was not allowed to work, that was one of the conditions of the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So that had to be done surreptitiously. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And so -- so, there was a certain degree of discomfort, but- but even though this was a rather mild getting around the government regulations, compared to others, so that wasn’t much of a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But you sort of had a feeling that you were in limbo, waiting for something, and that you really weren’t going to ge -- get on with your life until that number came up, which it finally did and we left in June of 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Now, I must mention that my brother had also gone to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And then in 1948, I was walking with him on the <span class="DLF">street</span> one day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and -- and he said to me, “I will share something with you, but you mustn’t tell anyone.” </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And I said, “Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And he said, “I’m leaving next week.” </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And I said, “Where are you leaving to?” </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And he said, “Guess.” </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And I said, “Is it to <span class="REGION">Asia</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And he looked at me and I said, “<span class="REGION">Asia Minor</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="393">As it was known at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I said, “<span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Shh. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And indeed he took an illegal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and participated in the various wars there, worked in a lot of different professions and then was sent out in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> to Europe in 1956, and in 1956 decided that he had had enough of politics and international relations and everything else, and he went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and got a degree in physics and he got a - came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and got a Bachelors, a Masters and a Doctorate in physics and then went to teach in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , but -- from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- so we -- we came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> together, but almost immediately when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> , he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newcastle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And then when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , he had left for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So we really never had -- were together very much.</span></p>

QUESTION:  You must have been crushed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  But -- But anyhow, we landed and it was Flag Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">A gentleman came up who was selling flags, he pinned a little flag on my lapel and waited for some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I had no idea how much to give him, but in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , you could buy a loaf of bread for a penny farthing, which was a penny and a quarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So, a penny was a fair amount of money, so I thought that would be good. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So I gave him a penny and I heard a string of curse words as only a New Yorker can use. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">That was my introduction to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  A rude, rude introduction. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Now, I must tell you, that as you know, when one used to be able -- when one got a number to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it was based on the fact that someone in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had filled out an affidavit sponsoring you. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The person who filled out an affidavit was Mother’s half-sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And so we arrived, and arrived at the <span class="DLF">port</span> , and found no one waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So everyone -- we were waiting at the <span class="DLF">port</span> and everyone dispersed, everyone disembarked and we were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Of course, speaking the language well, but otherwise strangers in New York port. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And we were amazed that no one approached us. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So we went over the to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">HIAS desk</span> --

<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  In -- In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And, at any rate, we -- we left there after about three days, got in touch with HIAS and HIAS was kind enough to put us up at a <span class="BUILDING">transient hotel</span> , which was called the East Broadway Central Hotel, down on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">A very meager, transient hotel. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And then we managed to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on <span class="DLF">West 102nd Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">One <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for Mother and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And she managed to arrange a cour -- to take a course in baby nursing. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Her idea was that every mother who comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , needs someone to take care of the baby for a week or two and so she would take this course and -- and be able to find work, which she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">After a six week course, she found work and she would work for 30 hours a day and then have four hours off. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And so she worked very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">In the meantime, I -- this was in June, so it was at the beginning of the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It was a very hot summer in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I had never experienced heat like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But someone had told me about a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> , where I could get both a general and a Hebrew -- a thorough Hebrew education. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So, I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , went up to <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> and pleaded my case with the <span class="BUILDING">admissions office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">They asked me what my background had been, what I knew, whether I knew any Hebrew, and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I had had that one year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , which barely I was able to read, but that’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And they told me they didn’t see how I could possibly keep up, that all their students had had eight years of thorough Hebrew education, that the language of instruction in the Hebrew department was in Hebrew and they didn’t think I could -- I could manage it, so -- but finally they decided to give me some books and si -- told me to take these books and study them, and come back in September and we’ll see what we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So, I took them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there was absolutely no way, I -- I couldn’t make heads or tails out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I used to sit and try and it was very hard, I was really very discouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Came back in September and fortunately the registrar of the teacher’s institute of <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> , Dr. Greenstein took pity on me and said, “Well, why don’t we try you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And -- And so I started in the lowest grade -- in their lowest grade, where everyone was already speaking Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I remember my first word that I learned, that I could understand and -- and I spent the next six years at <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I graduated their <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> at 16 and then their <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at 20 and at 20 also received a Hebrew teacher’s diploma, and a diploma from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in proficiency in the Hebrew language, and learned Yiddish and -- and received a Bachelor of Hebrew literature, as well as a Bachelor of Arts, before I went to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So, it’s possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="502"><span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> was incredibly kind to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I had a difficult time there, I won’t say it was easy, I had a difficult time, but -- but <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> gave me a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They provided me with a card which was worth eight dollars per week, through which I could eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And they would, from a financial point of view, in terms of financial help, they were -- I -- I really couldn’t have gotten that kind of education if they weren’t around, so I’m very, very grateful to them and to President Velkin, who was always very kind to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  So there were some real organizations and institutions that -- that gave a real helping hand to you [indecipherable]

<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Are there other groups or -- of -- especially as you’re trying to get on your feet in those first months?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  I’m also wondering what -- if you have any particular memories of those early days of- whether it revolved around -- I don’t know if y -- 1f you perhaps brought anything with you, you know, mementos of -- of -- that you brought with you, things to remember, or -- or whether there was specific things that -- that happened on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , that -- that you recall, in those first days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  Well, in terms of mementos, yes, of course, I brought a number of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">From the war, I brought my blanket, but I was busy really building a future and not dwelling that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The past was always there, but I wasn’t dwelling on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I also brought a little book that I had borrowed from the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in Univ and never returned, and I still have to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I don’t know what the overdue charge for that [indecipherable].</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  And I also have a handkerchief which my father gave me when he left me at the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , cause I started crying and he gave me a handkerchief. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And that’s about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  And you carried those things with you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">You have them at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and a few photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">But, in terms of the early days, no, I think it was a -- a lonely existence, because I really didn’t -- I didn’t -- I didn’t really fit in, in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">My accent was strange, I had a British accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Didn’t know anything about baseball, didn’t know anything about American football.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Well, were they strange sports to you, did you -- you just didn’t connect with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  They were -- They were strange sports to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I had learned a little bit about soccer, but even that was strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I -- I found it very difficult to identify with the idea that someone would run after or hit a ball and then get all excited about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I mean, that just didn’t seem to me to be the essence of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And I -- And I -- I could never participate in any of these activities, I just thought they were silly. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And so -- so I really was -- I really, I think, I felt myself different. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Fortunately, at <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> , there were a number of young people who came from Europe and we formed sort of a clique. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And there were a number of Israelis who were strangers here. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">There were a number of people from <span class="REGION">South America</span> who were strangers, so there was this -- there wa -- there were a number of people who felt themselves alienated or strange in the environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But my purpose was to learn, and I did and -- and -- and that’s the important thing.</span></p>

QUESTION:  -- in the subculture of what you were part of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , or -- or -- or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  I think there may have been, but -- but I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the issue was more complicated, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they had their existence to fight for. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">They needed heroes, they desperately needed heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And -- And the people who survived the second World War were not looked upon as heroes, they were looked upon as cowards, and as sheep who went to slaughter, this was the public image. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And -- And that’s not what they wanted to transmit to their youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They needed power. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I mean, that’s why they transformed this whole thing of Masada, for instance, which when you think about it, Masada is as antithetical to Jewish history as anything ever has been. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">The hero of Jewish history was Rabbi Yochanen Ben Zacki, who, when the Romans surrounded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> and were about to destroy the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and the nation, had himself snuck out in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> , the story has it, with his students following as the mourners, because they would allow <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffins</span> and funerals to go outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and he went and formed the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> and basically saved the Judaism, through his <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yavna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That was the hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The idea that Jews would lock themselves up in a <span class="BUILDING">rock fortress</span> and commit suicide, is a very un-Jewish idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">The Jewish idea is to sneak out and continue the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It’s not to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> needed that at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And people -- we build monuments not to commemorate what occurred, but in order to fulfill the need that we have at that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> needed their paratroopers to go up on Masada. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So, in the same way, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> needed heroes to fight wars, they didn’t want people who were going to slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">The other thing is that we have, you know, on my observation also, is that there 1s in -- 1n survivorship, and I don’t particularly care for that word at all, but we’ll use it, there is a hierarchy of suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And -- And in general, my story, which is fascinating to you, 1s of no consequence to most quote, unquote survivors [indecipherable] talk to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  Because”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  Because, number one, I wasn’t in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and that’s the highest, particularly if you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And -- And number two, I was a child and what does a child know? </span><span class="sentence" id="589">A child has no feelings, a child doesn’t know anything, a child doesn’t observe the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  Have you ever encountered this in conversations, etcetera?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Ta-Talk about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  Oh yes, absolutely, there’s a -- in fact, I am not generally, perhaps that’s the way I look upon myself, too, but I’m not generally considered a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I know, for instance, when they are making up committees for Holocaust commemoration, I’m not included on those committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">My English is unaccented, my -- my attitude 1s -- is different, perhaps, because I -- my education was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I don’t -- I don’t fit the mold.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  Well, it’s almost amusing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And it’s -- it’s -- it’s an observation of the way life is, there’s no bitterness about it, 1t doesn’t do anything to me -- for me, one way or the other, but -- but there 1s this -- this hierarchy, so, in general, you know, people have very little interest in -- in -- 1t’s only recently that people had a fa -- interest in the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">That’s a very recent phenomenon and I suspect it’s because the older generation 1s dying out and - and also because the quote, unquote, those of us who were children are now getting into an age where we can be taken seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  This is very interesting, the whole -- this sort of internal levels of -- I wouldn’t necessarily quite say politics, but sort of the social structures of remembrance and all --

ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, no, no --
QUESTION:  Th-That wasn’t a phenomenon in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I’m sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  -- and in particularly, don’t forget, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> , I was -- I was ina Jewish environment, but no, I have experienced no anti-Semitism and I have since then, in -- in medicine, worked with people from many cultures and I have -- I have experienced only the highest respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I never had any -- any feelings at all of anti- Semitism that I have detected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  In -- In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  That’s quite a statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Well, can you then take us from it -- when you’re at <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> , at what point did you start getting a sense of -- of what you wanted to be in life, or what professional direction you wanted to take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Well, I -- ’'m not sure I know that, in fact, except that, again the -- the common wisdom among us -- and when I say us, among us immigrants, was A, that the one thing they can’t take away from you 1s wisdom, or knowledge, so you got to get that. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And number two, that there were certain professions that you cannot transport across <span class="DLF">geographic boundaries</span> and there are other professions that you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I met, as I mentioned previously, a lot of lawyers who were doormen and janitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I didn’t meet any physicians who were doormen and janitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">A physician, not only highly respected, but you can take the job with you wherever you happen to have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I think in those days, that was an important reason for choosing a profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And so -- And maybe my previous experience, my very brief experience at the end of the war, maybe that had something to do with it, I don’t know, but at any rate, I decided that I wanted to become a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Now, it wasn’t a rational decision, because I had in fact, never had a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Only went to one if I was deathly ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I never had any care to -- so to speak, didn’t know any physicians and to tell the truth, had very little idea as to what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But it sounded good, it was safe, seemed like a reasonable thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  So you --
ANSWER:  So I finished YU, and -- and luckily for me, the Einstein College of Medicine was starting in 1955 and I graduated in 1955, and so I applied to the first class of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and was very fortunate in having been accepted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And so I went there from ‘55 to ‘59, for four years and then decided to go into pediatrics. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I always liked children, liked the things that I learned in pediatrics in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And then, after looking around, decided to take my internship and residency at the University of Rochester Medical Center. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And this was very fortunate, both because it gave me a wonderful grounding in -- in medicine and also because I met my wife there, Jean. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">She was a secretary in the Department of Pediatrics a-and we met shortly after I came there, and we were married in 1961.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION:  And -- And during this time, all throughout your schooling, your Mother was [indecipherable] was -- what was she doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">ANSWER:  Well, she worked as a baby nurse, as I mentioned and then when that became a little too much for her in terms of the number of hours, she went to a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and worked as a bookkeeper in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">During my sophomore year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , she met a Mr. Stark, Mr. Edward Stark, who had been a lawyer in Europe, came to -- and had been a prisoner of war in the pol -- in the Polish army, and came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and went to -- back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and got a Master’s in social work and worked as a social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And they married in -- when I was a sophomore in -- in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So that’s --

<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  Well, you know, the full effect of it did not hit me until I had grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And -- Which is very strange, but that’s the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">When I had children, I was still building a career. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I was very, very busy and probably had not fully understood the implications of what occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">For instance, my -- our children are not named after anyone who died. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I can’t tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But all of our grandchildren are. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So, it’s an interesting phenomenon, and it was my children who chose to do that, not we, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The biggest effect on me, in terms of becoming a father and the biggest difficulty that I had is -- 1s in being able to identify with what my children were going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I had no one, remember- one learns how to become a parent, primarily, I think by the things that your parents did, and you either emulate them or react against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But one way or another, you learn from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And I didn’t have that memory and that was a very difficult thing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I didn’t have memory of going to second grade or going to fourth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I never went to those grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I couldn’t identify with them going to a ball game or -- or any of the things that -- you know, so I really didn’t -- I wasn’t sure how to do this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">But --

<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I really never -- had to grow up fast and didn’t have any of that, so I think that was the most difficult part of it, and -- but they all turned out to be wonderful kids and wonderful adults today, so I guess we did something right, mu-muddled through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">But I think that was the biggest -- biggest problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  Do you think that there are any -- I mean in -- in raising kids, given what happened to you, and -- and the -- the fear that you had to live with, did you ever feel like there were - and again, this is the kind of thing that’s probably hard to separate, cause every parent 1s protective --

<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  -- but did you ever feel like you remembered certain things and you -- a-and there’s no way that you would ever allow your child to be exposed to anything dangerous, that sort of thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I -- I was always a risk taker and -- and I don’t believe that I ever -- at least -- in fact, I would say this, that I bent over backwards -- I worked very hard and very consciously, not to allow my experience to spoil their childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And -- And I probably didn’t tell them as much about things until they were adults, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Until they were -- And so, I -- I felt a tremendous sense that, you know, somehow we had this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> got derailed and it was my job to put it back on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And -- And so I worked very hard with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">You asked me a question that evoked- that evoked some thought about I think, certain things or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">For reasons that I’m sure would come out on a -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> if I ever went to a psychiatrist, but which are probably not that deep, there are certain things today, which I cannot -- I cannot tolerate. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Sudden, loud sounds, flashing lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I have gone way out of my way, in an almost pathological fashion, if I hear a balloon being blown up with helium. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">That sound, that whistling sound is like the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And so -- And the same things goes with flashing lights, I have a great deal of trouble with that and I usually try to avoid it. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">In fact, I go to a play, even today, and I see a gun coming out of a holster, even on a comedy, I walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I become very tense and then my wife usually says, “Please, let’s go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And it’s totally irrational, but there it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So, my kids never had balloons. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Never had balloons at a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">My wife would always see to it that there were no balloons. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So, stupid thing like this, there would be a little thing that would evoke something.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  No, sirens don’t bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">No, sirens don’t bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But it’s primarily that, I was once -- we went to <span class="BUILDING">Disney World</span> , I was lecturing and we went to a very fancy <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and afterwards they had a light and sound show and everyone was going, so we went along with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And it started and I thought I’d never get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And then I was so grateful when I got out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And -- So I could never take them, for instance, to the Fourth of July fireworks display. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="736">'d have my wife take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So they wouldn’t miss it, but I just could not go to a fireworks display. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So these are the kinds of things that deep down, there is still some fear left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  Are there conscious -- I mean, obviously this is conscious, what you’re saying, but I’m wondering are there other kinds of -- say when you -- when you dream, do you -- are there certain things that you really remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Things that recur?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  Yes, we went back, I believe it was in 1991. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But before I tell you that, let me tell you another episode which you just reminded me of. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">When I was at <span class="BUILDING">Univ</span> , there were two other Jewish children, and I mentioned one of them before, his name today is Oded and I could not remember the name of the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I have a picture of all three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I knew that the -- one of the boys, his name -- I knew his last name was Amirand. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I don’t know why that stuck in my mind, but I knew it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And over the years, I always wondered what ever happened to those two youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I would give anything to be able to connect with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I would go to, one of my rituals was to go to the phone book and look at the name of Amirand, and it’s an unusual name, and I never found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">A few years ago, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , and I had previously looked in the Jerusalem book, but I had not looked in the Tel Aviv book. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , and I looked in the book and I found an Adolph Amirand. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So I called the number and an old gentleman answered, and I told him my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I told him why I was looking for someone and he said to me, ‘As you can hear, I’m an old man, I’m 89 years old, but the person you are looking for 1s my nephew. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel

his memory was extremely vague, but he did remember me, and we had a wonderful reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We made up to go to dinner the following evening and came to his <span

dinner, I will go and I will check up on him, make sure he’s all right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I said to him, “You know, Oded, I don’t feel comfortable in going out to dinner, eating, if he is an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Maybe you and I should go over there now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="771">He said, “Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we went over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> on stilts, and as we go towards the <span class="DLF">apartment door</span> , I don’t know what made me do it, I said to Oded, “Do you have a key?” </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And he said, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I said, “Why don’t you give me the key and let me go in first? </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I don’t have a good feeling about this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and no one in, we went to a <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> , on a <span class="DLF">porch</span> and he was lying on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> , in rigor mortis, had been dead for about eight hours or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So, we sat down, we had to call the -- the <span class="BUILDING">mortuary</span> and so on and we were sitting there and saying, gee, you know, if I had come one day later, I couldn’t have found him at all, because it was unpublished, so, weird event. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Now, Oded and I, after we had dinner and we talked about things and so on, we were both trying to remember the name of the third young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Both of us remembered him, because we had his picture, but we couldn’t remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We asked a number of people we thought might know, they did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">About two months later, on Israeli television, they were showing the movie, I think it’s called, “Les enfants ont peride.” </span><span class="sentence" id="783">French movie about Jewish children who perished in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And afterwards they had a panel and they asked Oded to be on the panel, since he had that experience of being in a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , they asked him to be a panelist, to react to the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And, as part of his reaction, he told the story of our meeting and he showed the picture that I had brought him, and he said, “We know this boy is Jewish, we don’t remember his name, we’d love to be able to find him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , a man is sitting and watching television and listens to this and next day he’s going on business to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">He goes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and he goes to the <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish theater</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And afterwards, is invited to meet the manager, whose name I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And as part of the conversation, he says to the manager, “Before I came here, I heard this story on Israeli television. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Do you know anyone who would fit that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And he said, “Of course, that’s Daniel Rottfeld, he lives two blocks down, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Well, Daniel Adam Rottfeld was in fact the third boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">He was, at that time, afraid to write me, because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was still Communist, so he got in touch with an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and suddenly I got a letter from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , telling me about him and the fact that he very much would like to be in touch with me, but that he can’t, and the reason he can’t is that he works -- worked at that time for the foreign ministry. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Now, eventually, when the Iron Curtain fell and so on, and we could exchange letters, it turned out that Daniel was left in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , no one claimed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">He was young, his parents had been killed, no one knew he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And when <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> made their pact, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> took all of it’s orphans and -- and moved them to the <span class="REGION">western parts</span> , so he was moved to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">He ran away several times from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , eventually found a sister and went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , received a degree in journalism and a degree in international relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And became one of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ’s fine- finest workers in the foreign ministry, despite his name of Rottfeld. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He didn’t hide the fact that he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And he led almost every Polish peace delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">He was one of the authors of the Helsinki accords. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">He brokered the peace treaty and -- for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorbachov</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muldova</span> , and has written some 300 papers, books and so on, on international relations, particularly relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of which he is an expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Today he’s the director of a <span class="BUILDING">peace institute</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And so -- so I thought I’d bring you up to date on how strange the world is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">QUESTION:  What a -- You know, I was just thinking what a incredible program it would be to weave -- to take this picture and then just weave the lives together, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">ANSWER:  Tremendous, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">QUESTION:  Incredible, remarkable lives that you have all lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">But you asked me whether we went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Well, I think it was nine -- 1t was either 1990 or ‘91, I can’t remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I received a letter telling me that the memorial would be placed on the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> , on the square where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> used to stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And that a number of people of the former community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> were going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> for this memorial thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I got it and I tossed it aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I had no interest in going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I really wasn’t sure I wanted to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But my wife, who has very good instincts and a lot of wisdom, picked it up and said to me, “I think you should go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And I said, “Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="817">What do I need them for?” </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And she said, “For two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">One is that, since this is being placed in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was, and your father was the rabbi of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , it would be very important for the people coming back, to have the son of their rabbi be present. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And the second thing is that this is one of the few times you’re going to get an opportunity to meet people who knew your family and might be able to tell you things.” </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And as usually, she 1s very wise person. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">So we went and we offered our children the opportunity to go with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Our boys refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Our oldest said, “I don’t ever want to step on the soil of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Our youngest was too busy with something, but our daughter and son-in-law went with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They had just been married. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And it was a very moving ceremony, at which I sang the prayer for the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">It was televised on Polish television and radio, was in all the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I did indeed get an opportunity to speak with -- with many members of the congregation who had come back, who were now elderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">We had had an opportunity to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and then - which is intact, interestingly enough and visited the <span class="DLF">graves</span> of my great-grandparents and I’m named after my great-grandfather, so I was able to reconnect with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Did some research in some of the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And, on the day I was signing out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , I’m standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> to sign out and an elderly lady, 76 years old, all dressed in black, comes up to me and says to me in Polish, “Bat Chameides?” </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I look at her and I answer her yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And she says to me, “Happy Birthday.” </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I looked at her, and she said, “Your birthday was three days ago.” </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And I said, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And she said, “Your brother’s birthday is September the 16th.” </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And I said, “Yes,” I said, “my goodness.” </span><span class="sentence" id="839">So I said, “You must be Agnes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And she said, “Yes, Iam.” </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And Agnes worked for our family as -- taking care of the children, for seven years. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">She was a young woman in her 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Now, she was an old lady, and she was very helpful, she told me a lot and she also brought me two pictures that she had, one of her and me and one of her and my brother, little pictures that she had kept for 50 years and that she gave to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So -- So it was a very good trip from that point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We also went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Several years later, my oldest son came to me and said, “You know, I made a terrible mistake that I didn’t go with you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Someday, I would really like to be there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And I said, “Well, my wife and I -- your mother and I are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">If you’d like to come with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , we’ll be glad to take you and we’ll take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> ,” which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So I was able to show him. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Our youngest son has not been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">ANSWER:  Now, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> we have not been back, although I have been trying to make arrangements to go back, I would very much like to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  Is it possible to describe the -- the range -- I-I mean, you actually described it beautifully, but I mean, in terms of the range of -- of -- of emotions that you had when you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I mean, th-the -- the amount of terrible memories, mixed with the beautiful memories that you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">ANSWER:  Well, you know, it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I didn’t have that many emotions when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> , because I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> in 1939, I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So, I have no memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So, my interest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> was primarily, almost academic in terms of trying to understand a community and so on, but I -- I don’t have any memories, as such, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">It was emotional for me to -- you know, to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and to know that my father had officiated at that ceremon -- at that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> so many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">But- But that’s about it, because you know, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> isn’t standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I did go to our former <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but I didn’t go up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I just looked at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , which didn’t mean anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> might have evoked other memories, but a number of the people who had tried to go to their former <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , who were in the -- in the group, were so horribly received by the current tenants, who were terribly afraid that they were coming back to claim them, and all they wanted to do was to see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So, they were so horribly treated that I didn’t want to put myself in that position, so I never even tried to go upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So, I -- I didn’t have deep emotions, I think, but --
QUESTION:  If it -- In -- In looking back at this whole period, 1f you -- I’m trying to ask this without having it sound so overly simplistic, but I guess what I’m trying to get at is -- is sort of the overall lessons that you’ve taken from it and that -- that’s something that we could spend hours and hours talking about, but I mean, in terms of both good and evil, I guess 1s what I’m -- what I’m asking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">ANSWER:  It -- It -- It’s -- You know, I’m too close to it to have any type of objectivity and I -- I - | wouldn’t dream of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">All I can say 1s that I think that -- I don’t think there’s been a day since -- since the war, that 1n one way or another, I hadn’t thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So it -- it’s something which -- it’s rare for people to have an event in their lives, which in many ways so totally dominates their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So, it obviously has had an influence, but I don’t think -- I don’t think it has had an evil influence, except for the evil which was done, but in terms of an -- an influence on my life, I -- I would like to think that it’s all been for the good. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I would like to think that I am a more tolerant individual because of it, that I’ve more understanding, that I have a deeper understanding of human nature, that I can see the humor in some German activity, that I try not to generalize about people. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I think I have a -- a deeper understanding of my religion, but I don’t in fact know that that’s why I have it, cause I don’t know what I would have been otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">When I said evil, I -- I didn’t really mean that it would be a way that you- something that you were carrying, but in terms of -- I guess maybe by way of explanation, I have a very close friend who’s a photographer, who spent -- do you know who the filmmaker Errol Morris is? </span><span class="sentence" id="874">He’s -- He’s a documentary filmmaker --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">QUESTION:  -- anyway, he’s doing a -- a film about the Holocaust and my friend is a still photographer and he went over -- he works with Errol, and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , this last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And of course, 1t was a profoundly moving and -- and troubling for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And one of the things that he was saying -- he -- he’s Armenian and his whole -- his, you know, two or three generations past had their own genocide --
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">QUESTION:  -- to -- to come to terms with and -- and his understanding of -- of his experience was that what happened was a universal lesson of what human beings can do to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Obviously there’s -- there’s many na-narratives one could take, based on experience and - and just how you interpret the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And I guess that’s part of what I was getting at and asking you about, this piece of it that -- that -- that -- that represents evil, which is whether you see this as a kind of a universal cautionary tale, or what -- what happened obviously to so many Jews as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I -- I see it in two lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">There’s no question that there is a universality to it, in that it shows us the capacity for evil in human beings and the depths to which people can fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And I think this is even stronger because the people who did that, were such a cultured people. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They had everything going for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">We wouldn’t have been surprised if it had been done by people we admire less, or who had achieved less. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">But somehow we believed that great music, that Bach and Beethoven and Schiller and Gerta. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The myth of western civilization is that these are the things that -- that conquer the beast in us and that civilize a human being and the shock is, they don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">That deep down, this is what we can- so there is a universal lesson that we all, unfortunately, have the capacity for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">At the same time, I think this was completely unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And whereas the Armenians had a -- a major genocide against them, the uniqueness of the -- of the Holocaust was that this was planned as the -- as a decimation of genetic material. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">In almost every other instance that you can name, the enemy would come in, would kill off adults, they would take children and babies and raise them as their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">But here was a determination by a so-called civilized people, to -- to totally eradicate -- 1t was a pathological hatred to eradicate any sign of genetic material. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">For three generations, you were tainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So if you were Christian and your parents were Christian, but you had a grandfather who was Jewish -- that’s unheard of in any other genocide. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And -- So there is a universal lesson, but I think there is something which is so totally unique, which we cannot quite comprehend, about this particular one. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And of course, I read somewhere, I forget where, but I read that Hitler made the mistake of picking on the wrong people, because had he picked a less literal -- l-less literary people, people wouldn’t have heard about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But he happened to pick on a people who write a great deal, who study a great deal, who introspect a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And therefore, every other book -- you can’t -- you can’t pass a day without someone making a film or -- and you don’t hear about -- that about the Armenians, or -- and -- and I wish we would, because if we had, maybe people would be more cognizant, at least about that element in the human capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you one other thing along those lines, which is sort of another strain of- of meaning, which is the resilience, that -- that your life exemplifies, I mean, th-the incredible resilience that you’re sitting here and us sitting here talking represents, it’s remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">QUESTION:  And which 1s perhaps both universal and particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">ANSWER:  Well, you know, no one -- I didn’t arise in a vacuum. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">You know, I’m the product of many, many generations of very learned Jews, who had a philosophy of life and -- and -- and that philosophy of life was passed down from generation to generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And -- And every prayer that we utter and every aspect of our lives, reinforces the strength of the human character and the human spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">The fact that we are indeed created in the image of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Our freedom, our ability and the need for us to strive to achieve the highest that humanity can -- can have. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So I’m heir to that tradition and -- and -- so if there is a resilience, it’s -- it’s because, I think, of that tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">QUESTION:  Is there anything that you’d like to -- need to add to our conversation of any particular aspects of what’s happened and what -- what, you know, different events in your life that you'd like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  No, not really, you know, I -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I -- I had a -- When I go on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , I always like to talk to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I strike up conversations with people, find out what makes them tick and so on, and I was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> some years ago, going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Asuncion</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sao Paolo</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And I was sitting next to a couple who were speaking German. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So I -- about my age, so I started speaking German to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And the man who was sitting next to me wanted -- he wanted to know how it -- “Where did you learn such good German? </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Where did you learn to speak German?” </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And I told him that was my mother tongue and told him that I was born in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And he said to me, “You know,” he said, “I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> once.” </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I said, “Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="920">When were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="921">He said, “When I was only about seven or eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But my father was an officer in the German army and I was stati -- and he was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="923">He said to me, “But,” he said, “I want you to know, my father had no role in this at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But I do remember,” he said, “once, we were going down a <span class="DLF">street</span> and I looked and I think I saw some Jews, and he made me turn the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And I asked him, ‘Who are these people?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And he said, ‘nevermind.’” </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And he said, “And that’s the only time I heard.” </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And we talked a little bit more, and he turned to me and he said, “You know, I can’t go anywhere in this world, and we have traveled so much, and I can’t go anywhere in this world, without meeting someone who has gone through this and I feel such incredible guilt about what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">What can I do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And I turned to him, I said, “My friend,” I said, “you were seven years old and I was seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I wasn’t responsible for my victimhood and you weren’t responsible for what your people did.” </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I said, “But we each have an obligation. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Your obligation is to teach your children and grandchildren and their friends what happened and why it must never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">That’s your personal obligation. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And it’s my obligation to teach my children and my grandchildren.” </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And with that, we parted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sao Paolo</span> .</span></p>
