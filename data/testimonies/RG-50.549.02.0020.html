ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Well, it’s your interview, so it’s up to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Well, I want to thank you for taking time out from all your domestic disasters to --
ANSWER:  It’s just one of those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I mean, you can use the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , but you can’t use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sink</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Well, let me just ask you to say your name and you know, where we are today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Is this part of the interview now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Yeah, we’re starting now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] now? </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We’re starting? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My name 1s Fritzie Fritzshall. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">You’re in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at ***!,</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And once again, thanks for taking time out to do this interview today. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">You have already done a video interview with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> about your early experiences and your experiences during the war, and really the purpose of this interview, is sort of to pick up that story from where you left off and take it up to the present. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So I would like to ask you, though, if we could go back maybe a step and if you could describe what your circumstances were right around the time leading up to when you were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">What it -- where you were, what happened and then how liberation took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Liberation from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or once we’ve gotten out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I mean, which <span class="NPIP">part</span> do you want to hear about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Well, I was thinking sort of when the Russians picked you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But if you want, you -- wherever you would -- wherever you would like to start from, actually, would be fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Okay, we can start --
QUESTION:  It -- do you want to talk about how you got away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Well, actually, we were on the Death March and my particular group was liberated by the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">After we were liberated, we were put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span> , which was a Fritzie Fritshall does contain a 5 second black out at the beginning of the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The interviewer asked Ms. Fritshall to state her name and where the interview was being conducted. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">In responding to the question, Ms. Fritshall inadvertently stated her address. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">At the request of the interviewee, her statement of her address has been blacked out on the user copy and removed from the transcript to protect her privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">However, the master copy and protection copies have not been altered. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The three asterisks in the body of the transcript indicate the removed address spoken by Ms. Fritshall. </span><span class="sentence" id="30"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And, of course they had to delouse us. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They had to give us medical attention and they feed us and try and sort of organize. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I mean, we were a -- a -- a very displaced group, a very sick group at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And once they took our names and asked us if we had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go to, or whatever -- some of us chose to go back to our original <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and some of us stayed behind and stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> for quite awhile and then I chose to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , hoping that possibly my brothers or someone that had survived, had come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that we could reunite. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But I truly was mistaken, because no one came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">One aunt, who survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz concentration camp</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> rather than coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , thinking that I hadn’t survived, although sh -- she did see me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz camp</span> , so she knew I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But she thought that I, too had gone to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , as millions of others had. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And when she heard that I had survived, she too came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So actually it was just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and found our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- my mother’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that we lived in, destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was used for a lookout post. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was like on a little <span class="DLF">hill</span> and the soldiers had used that and it was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- which was my aunt’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> who came back, stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was totally stripped of everything <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">There were nothing but <span class="DLF">walls</span> and <span class="DLF">windows</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And w-we moved into this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Actually, I was the very first one to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and I was the first one to move into my grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I would go and meet a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that passed through our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> once a day, hoping that someone survived and people would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And little by little, some young people did trickle back. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And -- including my aunt and we all lived in my grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">When we came back we had no money, we had no food and we just had the clothes on our backs. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Our neighbors had stripped our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was used by neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We recognized some of our clothes that was worn by some of our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But no one came, no one offered and no one asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">What we had to do was go and dig for potatoes in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Gather some potatoes and whatever we could from the harvest. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And this is what we lived on for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I knew my father was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but I did not know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I could have never found him, except that he found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My dad had -- after the war, my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he remembered and he wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , looking for his family, looking for survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I had gotten a letter through the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> , from my dad and gotten his address and was able to get in touch with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And he was able to send me American dollars through the letters that came. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">A five dollar bill, a 10 dollar bill -- which we were selling on the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">At that time an American money, we were getting a lot for it, because the money in Europe was really devalued at that particular time, so we were able to buy food after awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We were also getting clothes through -- I believe it’s the United Restitutio -- I don -- I don’t know, it was called Unrah. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I don’t know what it stands for, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  And we were getting clothes from them and I remember getting packages and opening the packages and getting clothes that was actually used already and getting shoes that didn’t fit and looking for the candy that was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and we were getting gum. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we would open the package of gum and didn’t know that we were supposed to chew this gum and chew it, you know, we just ate it like candy, thinking, “Gee, this 1s kind of funny candy,” you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  You’d never seen gum before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  I had never seen gum before. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we stayed in my grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until some of the organiza -- some of the young people were able to get it -- in touch with some of the organizations and some of them were getting help in other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I was able to get in touch with my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And then the <span class="DLF">borders</span> closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I had gotten caught on the side of Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Both my aunt and I had gotten caught on the side of Communism and we were not able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I was not able to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at that point, or get in touch with my dad any longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Can I s-stop you here one second? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You said the <span class="DLF">borders</span> closed, do you remember what year that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  No, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Actually, I don’t remember the year -- the exact year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Why don’t we leave your story where it is at the moment, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> have closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I -- if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to go back a couple steps and ask you about a -- a couple things you’ve -- you’ve mentioned already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  And bring out a little more detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">First of all, could you just tell us th-this aunt that your -- you’ve mentioned, could you tell us her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">She was my dad’s sister and she’s the only one that survived on my dad’s side, actually, and her name was Freida Weiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And eventually, she was also able to make her way to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My aunt had my dad, who was a brother and she had two other brothers living in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and through them she was able to make her way to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  And in your video interview, you talk about her and she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with you and you tell that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I'd like to go back to -- oh, sorry --
ANSWER:  No, the -- my aunt that I speak of in the video was my mother’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The aunt that I’m speaking of now was my father’s sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  The aunt that I spoke of in the video had not survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We were separated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and she was taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I had found out years later, through someone that knew her and was 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with her, that she lived to see liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The day she -- the day her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated, she was still alive and died that day, the day the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But, I think of her often, because she was my inspiration all through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">She was the one that kept telling me every single day, “We will make it and tomorrow will be better.” </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I made it, she did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But I couldn’t have done it without her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Her name was Bella Davidovitch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  And which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did she --
ANSWER:  She -- we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> together and then we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I was taken to -- actually, what happened was that our -- our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was emptied and we were put into a <span class="BUILDING">holding barrack</span> and our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and we knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">My -- they had a separation, my aunt was chosen to go onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to be taken somewhere’s else and the last she saw of me was walking towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And when she left me, she did not think that I had survived, she thought that we had all gone to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , her entire family and she really did not fight for her life at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So, possibly, if she had known some of us had survived, she maybe too, could have survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  And you -- what you tell in your video, it’s a remarkable story, you actually were in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> , I believe, of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  They -- people that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , after they were in the camp for, I believe, probably an hour, they knew about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You know, one separation had taken place and once we were taken into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and once we started to ask about our families, what had happened to our families, the people that had been in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> prior to us coming there, the prisoners, would point to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">This is how we found out what had happened to millions of others, to the children that we were separated from, to our parents, to the rest of our family, by just -- they would just raise their hand and they would tell us to look at the smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And of course, this is how we found out about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We lived with it day in and day out we lived with the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We watched the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> coming in, we watched the separations, we watched people marching to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , but there was no way we could help them or do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So, we learned -- we learned every single day, twice a day, there was a thing called a pell, where we all had to line up to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">When they called a pell in the morning and at night, nobody wanted to be in the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , or at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , cause there was always punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">People were always pulled from the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span> or the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Sometimes from the center, but basically, it was easier to pull from the beginning or the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So everybody fought to be in the center of the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and there were only so many middles, somebody had to be in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Because my aunt was on this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , leaving, I had -- was hoping I could go with her and so I was at the very end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and she watched all of us marching into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And in the very last moment, six of us were pulled out and put onto another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to do s -- go to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to do slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had pulled away already and she did not see me not walking into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , so she assumed that I too had gone into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> with the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And do you know if she ever knew whether you had survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Did word ever reach her somehow? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Do you have any way of knowing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  I have no way of knowing, but I believe she did not know, because the people that were with her, that told us that they knew her and she had died, remember her speaking about everyone being killed one way or another or going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So I -- I am assuming she did not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  And do you know the day she died, which was the day when her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  I don’t know the dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Yeah, no, no, not the date, but 1t was the day the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated that she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Was that because of just, you know, illness or that she was in a run down condition, or --
ANSWER:  She was ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">She had gotten an infection in an -- in a leg -- 1s -- from what we had heard, and blood poisoning had set in her leg and at that point she really didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">She - you know, when -- when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , there -- there came a point, during a low moment maybe or when hope was lost, where people didn’t care whether they lived or died, especially if they knew no one else survived, they just didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And at that point, I believe that she didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I don't know how else to express this, except that I -- I believe that she felt she was the last one of the family and -- and she too gave up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Sorry to bring this up, but something just came on, 1s that the air conditioning, or --
ANSWER:  Maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Could be the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I don’t know how to shut it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You never turn that off, huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Occasional noises you might hear in the background, they’re <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">household appliances</span> that can’t be shut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Well, it must be the air conditioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But it’s hot in here and we need the air conditioner, guys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">All right, we'll just go -- we’ll go along with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So -- do you -- you were -- do you remember -- did you even have time much, to have much of a reaction when they suddenly pulled you away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and sent you in another direction? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Can you remember what you felt or was it just so hectic that --
ANSWER:  Do you know, things were happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where one didn’t have the normal feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We were, for the lack of a better word, dehumanized, maybe? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We learned to accept life as it was on that particular moment and when you are with people in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for a le -- any length of time and you see them marching into a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , you don’t think, “Well gee, I am the lucky one, I walked away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Maybe I’m not the lucky one, maybe they are the lucky ones, because I don’t know where they’re going to be taking me and it might be worse than where I am now. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So, the reaction was a -- was not, “Gee, I’m really glad because I’m still alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It just -- you accept it as 1t comes, that particular moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">The fear is always there, that you don’t know where you’re being taken, that you’re going to get less food than you had that particular moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That you might be -- feel hunger more than you do that particular moment, because you’re already hungry, you’re already abused, you’re already skinny, you’re already sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the moment comes when you just say, “Okay, this is another thing that’s happening to me today.” </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And so you just flow with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Did you know w -- that -- where -- while you were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , did you know where your aunt was or where she’d been taken, or did you not find out what happened to her until the war was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  I did not know where she was being taken to. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">As far as I was concerned, she could have been taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and put to death in a -- in a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I didn’t know what she did or -- or even if she was alive, until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Actually, we found out -- you know, it’s -- it’s a big world, but it’s a small world. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">You know, you talk to people and one will say, “Well, I was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ,” or “I was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And when you give a family name or when you start asking, people remember and people know and you get a little information.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  And this is how I found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  In your video, you describe it, maybe just very briefly here you could say, you -- you did get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then you got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , basically, towards the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Where -- where’d you -- can you tell us the name of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , where 1t was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We were -- what -- what they did is, I don’t know if you saw any other videos, but- but -- or if you’ve read anything about the Holocaust, but towards the end of the war, when Hitler started to lose the war, he started -- I use the word he because of Hitler, but basically it’s -- he didn’t do it alone, obviously, he had his machinery that worked for him, all the people that ran the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and gathered the Jews and drove the Jews to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> and drove the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I -- I will refer to them as his mach- machinery, because this is what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They -- the Germans started to empty the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> where slave labor -- labor was being done. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They started to bring the people in from all over, wherever they did slave labor and they brought them together with the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and they created a group at that point, a huge, huge group. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Men and women together at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And it is known today as a Death March. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It was -- they brought us all together, we were in rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I recall that I had -- my -- my shoes didn’t fit, my clogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I could hardly walk in them because I had outgrown them, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And it was very cold and I -- I recall taking rags and wrapping rags around my feet as I was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And they really walked us in circles, at least 1t seemed to us as 1f we were walking in circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They walked us through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , they walked us through <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They -- we slept in -- around haystacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I mean they -- then -- and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Most of us were very sick, some people had gotten dysentery and they had to stop, of course and they were being shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They would walk us into -- through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest areas</span> and I recall at one point sleeping on the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and just watching the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , I mean, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> coming down low, passing us and we were hoping that they would bomb us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We were sick, we were tired, we were hungry, we were thirsty and we didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">At one point they started to walk us through a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We were on the <span class="DLF">road</span> actually, but -- but the <span class="DLF">road</span> was through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And a friend and I realized that some of the people were trying to escape at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And it was also towards the very end of the war and the Germans were also tired, taking us through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , you know, and all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And when -- we were watching people escape and they were shooting at these people and -- and they were -- they were being horrible to us, even at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I recall, as we were walking through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- they would walk us through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> knew and saw and heard, we were like -- like a herd of cattles taking over this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and walking through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I recall shades being pulled down, <span class="DLF">windows</span> being closed, <span class="DLF">doors</span> being locked so that they wouldn’t -- they pretended they didn’t see and they didn’t hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But yes, occasionally, a <span class="DLF">window</span> would open and a piece of bread would come out, a potato would come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Something would fly out a <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We all pounced on this because we were terribly hungry, they weren’t feeding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And we would pounce on this food and th-the SS men -- the soldiers would shoot at us in groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We didn’t care, we wanted that piece of bread, we wanted that food. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">When we came to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , my aunt and | -- my -- my girlfriend and I took our hands and looked at each other and said we’re going to try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">If they shoot us, they shoot us, but we cannot take this any longer, we will try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And we picked a time where they -- other people also tried to escape on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> and the soldiers were busy shooting at other people and we escaped and they did try to shoot at us at that point, then we came into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">If I tell you that every time I think of this escape, I can count my heartbeat even today. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I mean, our hearts were -- we -- we took each other’s hands after we hid behind -- behind some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and we took each other’s hands and we were feeling each other’s hearts as our hearts were beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It was like it was going to come out, pop out. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And we stayed in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> all night long. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We stayed hidden and we watched people walking by -- the prisoners walking by. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The next day, we stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and when it started to get dark, we decided that we’re going to try and see if we can find a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , steal food somewhere, steal clothes somewheres. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">You need to remember, our heads were shaved, we were very skinny, we were in striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I mean, you could -- you could spot us a mile away, we couldn’t lie about who or what we were, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We came to this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and we were two dumb kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We were totally dumb children. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I recall a man opening the <span class="DLF">door</span> and staring at us and all we said is that we’re very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And we spoke German, we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And he looked at us and he said, well, he couldn’t give us food, but he will take us into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Well, he took us into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and he let us stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and he did bring us food, he brought us pieces of bread and he brought us some hot soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And he let us stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we were supposedly hidden in this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The next morning he came to us and he said he has to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he has to get food stamps for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Now here are two -- two Jewish kids that are hiding in a <span class="BUILDING">German barn</span> , dumb, believing this man is going to go and get food stamps for us, because he has to had food stamps or whatever story he told us, in order to feed us, and we believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We’re two stupid kids and we believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And we stood there and we looked at each other and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And all of a sudden it dawned on us, this man is going to turn us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I mean, what is he going to do, go and tell people he’s getting food ti -- food stamps for two Jewish kids? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So we stayed there and we watched him leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And his wife stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And we left the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we went into the <span class="REGION">forest area</span> again and we hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And we were trying to pick, we picked snails. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Today, it’s called escargot and it’s a delicacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Do you know what snails look like when they come out of dirt and dirty snails? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We absolutely had no water to wash them with. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We dug for whatever food we could in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and eventually we saw the Russian army come in and take over, and we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And the Russians took us and they put us on -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they took us to an <span class="REGION">area</span> where they already had -- had freed some prisoners, and --

ANSWER:  We could see them through -- as they -- we saw their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We saw their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> coming and we saw their insignia and we knew it was -- we didn’t care who it was as long as it wasn’t the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I mean, it could have been Pakistani for all we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I mean, it happened to have been the Russians, but at that point we didn’t know it was the Russian lead -- we just knew an army came and we were going to be freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But it was the Russian army that came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Do you remember exactly how you met them when you walked up to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">What -- if you could tell me what happened, what -- you know --
ANSWER:  I just recall walking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">My -- my friend and I, the two of us just walked out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and they saw us and they knew -- they knew who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They gave us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I remember one man, in fact, one of the soldiers, a Russian soldier, pulled up his sleeve and he had watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">He had an arm full of watches on his -- and he looked at me, he said, “Do you want to pick a watch?” </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I mean, the last thing in the world I ever wanted at that point was a watch and I said, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And he had a man’s ring and he took off a man’s ring and he gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">To this day I don’t know what I did with the ring, cause I don’t have it and I must have lost it somewheres, cause it didn’t fit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He handed me this ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He just wanted -- he wanted to be nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He -- he -- he saw that we were these two hungry kids and he tried to be nice to us and he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And they brought us into this -- which they established, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and there were people there already and they had given us a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and they gave us -- they deloused us and they gave us clean clothes and they gave us food and they -- medical attention for those that needed medical attention and I remember them telling us, eat slowly, just a little bit of soup, just -- and -- and I just wanted to take all of that in at one point, you know, but I must say at that point, they were good to us, they were nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You know, so --

<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  To protect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We still didn’t have medical attention, we were still not deloused at that point and you know, when you come out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , who knows what kind of a disease you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And these were soldiers and they were afraid of -- you know, that they would come and rape us, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And they were protecting their soldiers from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So we were getting protection in the same way, actually, but 1t wasn’t for our protection, it was for theirs, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  And what happens next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Well, I was there for awhile, until they gave me medical attention and they fed me and they deloused me and there was a lot of talk amongst ourselves, amongst the people that were freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Amongst the Jews who -- where are we going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">What are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Do we have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go to? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Who has survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Do we want to go back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometowns</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">These are the people that didn’t want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We were afraid to go back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometowns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So there were a lot of discussions of what to do, but how long can you stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and how long are they going to keep you in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Although today I know that many people stayed for many months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , but I didn’t know this at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I was anxious to get out of there and I chose to go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And the Russians did give me passage to go to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Didn’t give me extra money, did not give me any extra clothes, but did give me passage to go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And when I -- of course when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I found nothing and no one.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  So, oftentimes we didn’t ask for last names. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And after we were liberated, we just lost touch with each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  Do you remember her first name?</span></p>

QUESTION:  I -- If I -- again, I’m sorry to stop you here, but this is sort of where we left off before and you said that when you got back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- 1f you could describe again what it was like to go back there, how they saw you returning. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">You said that you saw people wearing clothes, living in your <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Tell us a little more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  How does one describe of -- seeing someone or not seeing someone, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We were the people -- we were the Jews that came back, that our neighbors gave up, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">One way or another they gave us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They turned in our names when the Germans first came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They may not have pointed all of us out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but they did have to turn in our names. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">When we were being gathered -- when we were being taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , while we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , these neighbors never came to ask if we needed anything, if they could help us, if we were hungry, if we were thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">When we came back, after the war, we were the people that didn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">They looked through us. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They didn’t speak to us, they didn’t acknowledge us. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They didn’t ask us if we needed anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They didn’t offer to give back my mother’s clothes or my mother’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They didn’t offer to make us a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We were just the invisible people, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So, we came back, but as far as they were concerned, they didn’t accept us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And, when you go to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you’re not accepted, you in turn get this attitude of, well, they didn’t really want me, so I don’t want them either, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And we did the best we could without associating with neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Which is very strange because, if you’ve been to Europe, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> are close together. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It’s -- you live as a community. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Prior to the war, we lived as a -- as a community, we were part of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together, we lived together, we -- we played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And here I come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- this was my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But there was nobody waiting for me and nobody to accept me back into this community. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So, it was a very strange feeling and I have to tell you that I couldn’t wait to get away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I couldn’t wait to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I was afraid to go to sleep at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I don't know if you can understand this today, but there was -- we -- we lived with the fear of bei -- being turned in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There -- there was no freedom when we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We had to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Did you ever have any encounters with any of your former neighbors or acquaintances? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Any -- any conversations, encounters in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , anything you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Or you stayed in these sort of sep -- they were in their separate world and you were in your separate world at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  It was a totally separate world. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was strange because when my dad -- after I had contacted my dad and he had gotten my first letter, he called me long distance, of course, to -- to Europe, from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We had one telephone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and that was in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So the postman came to tell me that I was going to get a long distance call tomorrow at three o’clock, from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I mean <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was this -- this big <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know, the -- the symbol of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">When I came to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , the next day at three o’clock, to wait for my call, the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was out there listening and looking, but nobody acknowledged me, but the ears were all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And, so it was kind of interesting, because obviously they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Everybody listened in and of course, when you are not used to speaking on a telephone, you shout. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You think that you need to shout cause, you know, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and -- and it’s going to get across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And, so obviously they did hear my end of the conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I’m sure they heard it across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , you know, cause I was shouting, but didn’t hear the other end of the conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But they were curious enough to leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and to come to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But no offer of any help. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And, I think to this day, I live in a sense of amazement, shock, maybe wonder, that people could be that way -- that people could act that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">That if people see a hungry child, not to offer food. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">That, of people to see someone hurting, not to ask why. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It was an amazing world and amazing people and to this day I don’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I don’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And probably, if I were to go back there today and speak to them about this, they would see it in a different way and they would remember it in a different way than I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But I have a very clear hurt -- hurt memory of this, that even after the war -- I think I would have respected them more if they had come to us after the war and if they had said, “This was a mad world, we didn’t know what we were doing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Or, “We did know what we were doing, but we misjudged.” </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Or, “How can we help you today, to overcome this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Or, “We’re really sorry for what happened.” </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I would look at these people and I would say, “I can understand.” </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But I can not understand indifference. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Indifference hurts. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Indifference causes wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Indifference causes children to be killed and causes hunger and I think we all need to care. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And maybe we’ ve learned from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But right after the war, the lesson wasn’t there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  I take it from what you’re saying that you’ve never gone back to the <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  I’ve been back to Europe and I was not far and I was going to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> and I was going to go back there, out of curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">You need to know that there 1s a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I was born in, I have wonderful memories of. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And also very sad and very bitter memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The draw is there to go back and relive some of my good memories, but the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> is that there’s no one I know there. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Do I really want to see what my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looks like today? </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Do I really want to go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And there’s this -- this constant fight, there’s this -- yes, part of me wants to go back and see and the other part of me says, “But you weren’t wanted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You left there cause you weren’t wanted there, why do you want to go back?” </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But I’m also going to Europe in three weeks, through the <span class="BUILDING">Washington Holocaust Museum</span> and this thought plays in my mind even today, am I going to go back, am I not? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Cause I’m not going to be that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  The other time, you decided not to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  I decided not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The hurt was -- I couldn’t face it. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I chose not to face it. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">The memories are too fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">When I -- many people -- most of us were liberated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> 50 some years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I was liberated when I started to speak about my experiences and the memories are still too fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And I -- I can’t face the hurt just now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  Do you remember -- you s -- you were talking about -- talking to your father on the phone, now that was the first time in years you’d heard his voice, I’ve -- I guess, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Cause he was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> while -- while all this happened to the rest of your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Other than the people all being there and listening to you, can you re -- you remember much of that conversation or what it felt like to -- to finally be able to -- to speak with him again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  I -- th-the one memory that I really have of is him crying at one end on the phone and me crying at the other end of the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And him asking of do I know if anybody else had survived and -- and telling me that he was going to try and bring me to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that he wanted me to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And my end was mostly, “Oh, yes,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And -- and I remember the tears, just a lot of -- a-at that point they were tears of sadness and of happiness and -- and the first conversation was -- was a very sad conversation for both of US.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  How old were you at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  I think I was 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So then I guess the next step 1s to get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  Well, it’s not so easy to get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when you live in Europe right after the war and you’re caught under Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So there are steps to be taken from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Some o - some of the Jews had left that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and had gone to -- the -- the <span class="REGION">areas</span> had become divided and part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had become the Su -- the <span class="REGION">Sudatenlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And my mother’s one brother had lived and gone to the <span class="REGION">Sudatenlands</span> and he knew that I had survived and he was in touch with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And he paid a man money to have me smuggled over the <span class="DLF">border</span> from where I lived, under Communism, into the <span class="REGION">Sudatenlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So, he paid this man money and this man was a professional smuggler of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And there were several of us 1n this group, several women. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And he collected the money ahead of time and he took us in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was in the winter, in snow up to our knees, in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We all gathered and had our little knapsacks on our backs and he is going to help us cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So now, he takes us at night and he takes us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we’re going to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> in the middle of the night and he -- we walked -- after walking hours and hours and hours in snow in -- in -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and slipping and being cold and being hungry and he brings us into a little bit of a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , some sort of a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And in this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and there’s hot soup waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And it was nice and warm and he told us that we are to spend the night in this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and we’re to have the hot soup and get a good night’s rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And he is going to come back the next day and he 1s going to lead us the rest of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And he leaves us and he forgets to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">He never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So, we stayed in this little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> -- whatever it was, for two days and three days and four days and we didn’t know whether we had crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> or hadn’t crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We didn’t know which way the <span class="DLF">border</span> was and we didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And we finally realized that this man is not going to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So, we decided we’re going to take a chance and just pick a direction and we’re going to go in a particular direction, which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And we made our way through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> at night and when daybreak came, we came to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we came near a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And there were small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> that were turned over -- like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinghies</span> , I guess they call them, they were turned over because it was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And so we did -- in the -- in the day, we all climbed underneath these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">You know, two or three of us would take one little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we climbed underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we spend the day there and when evening came, we came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">At this point we’re hungry and we came out and we started to walk into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , three of us at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And we came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and when I looked up at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- I don’t even recall now, I remembered my grandmother had family living in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So, I started to ask questions and their name was Weissburger, so I stopped someone on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I asked, “Do you know where the Weissburgers live and did any of them come back?” </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And the person said, “Oh, yes,” he said, “there are two brothers that survived the war and came back,”’-- excuse me -- and showed us where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So the three of us came to my cousin, who opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and when I -- they didn’t known me and I told them who I was and what we -- what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They took us in and they went and brought the rest of the group to come to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">At that point, when we crossed the bor -- when the man was going to bring us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , we all had families or friends waiting for us with falsified papers, so we could stay in the <span class="REGION">Sudatenlands</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="460">My uncle was waiting for me with falsified papers and I also had one cousin that crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> with me and she was going to be met by someone else with falsified papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Well, we stayed with my family there for several days and their friends and families were notified and they all came to get them with their papers, as did my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">My cousin couldn’t get in touch with whoever it was who was bringing her papers and she walked out one day and she was caught and sent back over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I had learned since that she stayed there and had married someone and had raised a family, but stayed under Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I, on the other hand, went to where my uncle lived and stayed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">My uncle had a little <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and I helped him in this <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">After a while, he also smuggled my aunt, who came to stay with me in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">He had her smuggled out with someone else and she also lived with us in this little <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and we helped my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I was able to get in touch with my father through there -- through letters, and he was able to send me papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">He also -- every time he wrote me a le-letter, there was either a dollar bill or a five dollar bill or a ten dollar bill in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">What I didn’t know was that my mail was being censored, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But it was handed to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">The day I was leaving on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , with my feet on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , with my passport in hand, the police came to ask me what happened to the money that my father had sent me, because that meant that I was selling at <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">My aunt is standing at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , my uncle is standing at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , my friends came to see me off, there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that friends came to see me off cause I was leaving the <span class="REGION">Sudatenlands</span> and going to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I am standing on the <span class="DLF">steps</span> of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> as the police are looking at me and asking me what happened to the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And I held up my passport and visa and I said, “Oh, I had to pay for my passport and my visa with that money. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I had to go and pay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It was like, I can’t believe I was thinking this fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">What made me give this answer?

<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  The scene Is -- it’s very hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">How does one describe a father seeing his child for the first time in many years? </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Or -- or a child seeing her father for the first time, in freedom? </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It was a lot of emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I don’t know, I can’t even describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And especially on my dad’s part, because I believe that all his life, he lived with the guilt that he left and he lost his family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He lost his two sons, he lost his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He didn’t leave us by choice, he didn’t desert us. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He left us to make a better living for himself and for us, so it isn’t that he walked away from us; he always supported us. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But his feelings were always that maybe if he had stayed, he could have done something more. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Or maybe if he -- maybe he could have sent papers sooner -- which he couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We had all our papers to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We just got caught in the madness of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And he never should have felt guilt and he never should have blamed himself, because he did whatever he needed to do and the best he knew how. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So, I honestly believe that all his life, he lived with -- with the guilts of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">But as far as I was concerned, he nee -- he -- he didn’t need to, because he couldn’t have done more. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And he certainly did everything he could for me, once I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I was one of the lucky ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Many survivors that came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> didn’t have it easy when they first came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Many tell the stories of being brought here, but families were sending them to work the next day and they had to live in -- in -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and they weren’t really welcome and they had very hard times. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">My dad was not a wealthy man, but he certainly provided for me when I first came. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">He gave me love. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I never lived with him when I first came here, cause he lived in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I lived with his brother and sister-in-law, who -- my aunt and uncle and my aunt, to this day -- she’s 82 years old and if she was my mother I couldn’t love her more and she couldn’t have been better to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I came to a loving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I came to a family that opened their arms to me and did the best they knew how. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So I really was one of the lucky ones.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="672">I spoke Czech, but did not speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">My aunt spoke a little bit of German. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So, between her little bit of German that she had and my German, we were able to communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And of course, with my dad, Is -- could speak Yiddish or I could speak, you know, in Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And it didn’t matter, you know, cause my dad’s -- when my dad came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he didn’t have time to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and -- and he -- his English was with a very heavy accent, as we all have, but his, you know, he never really learned how to speak proper English, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">My aunt decided that I was going to learn how to speak with her children, with her three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And every time I would say something that wasn’t so, as I was learning, she would correct me. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And to this day there’s a family joke where her little boy must have been two or two and a half years old at the time and she -- his name was Jimmy and she called Jimmy and he -- his answer was, “Here I are, Mommy, here I are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And now, my aunt did not correct her two year old or two and a half year old, but she looked at me and she, with her finger goes, “Fritzie, you don’t say here I are. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">You never say here I are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="682">You know, so she made sure that I learned how to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and -- and I think it’s due to her that I speak a little better English than some of us that came over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And -- but I was always unhappy, I always wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Always, all the time and now I am starting to speak out loud and now I am telling my dad, “I really don’t want to stay here, it’s very hard, I don’t know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I don’t know, I don't dress properly, I don’t do anything, I’m -- I -- I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And he always said, “No, you’ll learn, you’ll learn.” </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And I guess one day he decided he is going to call my bluff and he looked at me one day and he said, “Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">If that’s what you really want, if that’s what will make you happy, I will send you to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">When do you want to leave?” </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And at this point I go, “Well, maybe I really don’t want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Maybe I really like it here,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I have to tell you that I love this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Yes, I am a flag waver, with it’s politics and with all that’s going on, I feel it is my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and -- and I treat it as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I love it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  I went to a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> originally, it was called <span class="BUILDING">Adante School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And I remember taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> from where we lived to -- and it was quite a way to go, it was about 35 minutes by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And I remember coming there once and ha -- needing to get off, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> wasn’t stopping and I’m standing at the <span class="DLF">back door</span> and I’m hollering, “Up, up, up,” instead of saying that I need to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I didn’t know how to speak and everybody is standing there laughing at me because I am hollering, “Up,” instead of that I need to get off this -- this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And eventually somebody caught on and said, “I guess she needs to get off,” you know and they pulled that bell or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And then -- so I would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then my dad worked for <span class="BUILDING">Vienna sausage company</span> where -- which was like maybe a block away and I remember after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day, I would walk to <span class="BUILDING">Vienna sausage company</span> and have a sandwich there and wait for my dad to finish work and then I would -- he would drive me back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So this -- this was going on for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And I hated to -- I -- I -- I learned to hate corned beef sandwiches, cause I had one every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Today we find out it’s cholesterol heaven, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">What -- what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were you in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  We lived -- originally, when I came here, we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Rogersburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">1348 and a half <span class="DLF">Esther Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I li -- we lived in a four room apartment with three little children, my aunt, my uncle and Fritzie. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And originally I slept on -- they had those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> that converted into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">That was my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , because we were really cramped until we moved into bigger -- a bigger <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But, it was very hard in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It was- this is not an easy <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to come to. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">You need to remember that during the time we came here, right after the war, the Americans were not the travelers they have become today. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">The Americans, at that time, were not as tolerant of an accent as they are today. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Because today they travel and they’ve become the foreigners in the <span class="REGION">foreign lands</span> and they -- they know what it means to learn a different language. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">They were not tolerant of us; we were called the greena in -- in Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We were called the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We were told not to speak our -- about our past, we should forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Nobody wants to listen to us, nobody wants to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Some of us could not speak about our past, but some of us needed to speak about our past and nobody would listen to us and nobody wanted to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">We were told to keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We were just -- people did not tolerate us and were not always nice to us when we first came here and was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">This is a very difficult language to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">One word can have different meanings and especially to spell, my God, I mean, I’Il never learn how to spell. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I still don’t know why there is a k in front of a knife, you know, but -- the word knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">But it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Most of us found it very difficult when we first came here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  You were saying that you were told to forget about what had happened to you, that -- that people didn’t want to hear wh -- who was -- who was telling you this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  The families. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">The } -- the other Jewish people, the people that -- that one needed to talk to, our neighbors, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to hear about what happened in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Whether it was from guilt, that nobody did anything here or what it was from. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I remember when I got married and -- and -- and my husband and I went to the movies, the <span class="BUILDING">Chicago theater</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And in those days they used to show a newsreel before the movie started. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I recall a newsreel coming on while we were sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and it showed openings of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and -- and the atrocities of some of it, during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And I couldn’t face up to it and I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And my husband followed me and we came to -- we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Chicago theater</span> and as we’re standing there, people are saying, “I don’t understand while -- why they are showing those atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">We know that didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Those things could have never happened the way they are showing them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And I’m standing there, me, who has just come out of one of those <span class="NPIP">places</span> and not answering, because of ignorance of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So, they didn’t want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">How many of us close our eyes and close our ears to things that are going on 1n the world today? </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We don’t want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And maybe we could help and maybe we can’t, but we don’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  You mentioned in your video interview that your way of dealing with the Holocaust and your experiences was that for many years, I think the phrase you used was you put them on the shelf and you sort of kept them to yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Why -- is that what happened and why -- why did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Was it because of these messages you felt like you were getting, or --
ANSWER:  We were getting very mixed messages and we were also -- each one of us needs to handle a death or an atrocity or a tragedy in our own ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">We -- we can’t predict how we’re going to react and we should never judge the next person of their -- of how they are handling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I have learned this. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">My aunt and uncle that I lived with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> -- I’m just going to use this then, as an example, were -- were going on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">My uncle had just sold his business and they were going to take their first vacation and they were driving to <span class="REGION">California</span> and they got into a terrible accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">It was a head on collision and my uncle was killed instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And I remember getting this call that my uncle was killed and that the rest of them were all hurt and -- in this automobile accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Now, I loved my uncle as much as I loved my father or anyone in the family, cause I lived with him, he became my father image. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And I recall getting this call and going hysterical laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Laughing and crying, tears, but -- but -- like I was in -- in a hysterical -- now that was my way of accepting it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were similar, but a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">The shock of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the things we saw, the things we lived through. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And you might sit here for two weeks listening to some of the things that we had gone through in one day and listen to two different people from the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , experiencing the same thing, but seeing it and experiencing it in a different way and both reacting in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">When I got out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and when I came here, I -- I couldn’t live with those thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I couldn’t handle them. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I just -- I would have been -- they would have put me in an <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> if I had lived with it day in and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So, I guess my way was to pretend. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I pretended. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">All of those people were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> my family and all the other Jewish families, they were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">All those babies were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">The <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> were going day in and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I saw them in a movie, it never happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">This was a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I needed to walk away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I couldn’t think about it, I couldn’t live with myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I couldn’t watch my dad’s sad eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So, I went into a pretend world. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I needed to be a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">If Iam going to be this young girl, I am going to be this normal young girl and live a normal life, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So you put yourself in this pretend world and you live your days this way and it works. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">For the most part, 1t works. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Then come the nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">You don’t have control over your mind at night when you’re sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">You don’t have control over your dreams and your nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So, yes, you do pretend in the daytime, but the reality sets in through your dreams and through your nightmares, every single night. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Every single night, somebody had to wake me and tell me it was -- “it’s a dream, it’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">You’re okay now, you’re free.” </span><span class="sentence" id="787">To this day, when I speak about it, my husband still has to wake me and tell me, “It’s okay -- you’re okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So, for many years, I needed to live a different kind of a life and deny the fact that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I did this for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">When our son was old enough to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they didn’t teach anything about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I don’t know if they did when you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but there was very little in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It isn’t like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We didn’t have a <span class="BUILDING">Washington Holocaust Museum</span> to tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">He learned about the Holocaust in <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> and he’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And I couldn’t answer them. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I pretended that it didn’t happen to me, but I didn’t say this to him, I just said, “I don’t want to talk about it, we’re not going to talk about it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Yes, my me -- my family knew I was a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">My in-laws knew, my husband knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I didn’t pretend in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I never hid it from anyone, I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I have this accent, I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I came from Europe, how do I hide it? </span><span class="sentence" id="803">But, in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- immediate <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we couldn’t speak about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">It was not a subject that was brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">When our son went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and ask questions and I would give very little information. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">When he got married and our first grandson was born, he needed to know more. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">For his own sake, he needed to know more. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And those were the days when they were beginning to find some of the Germans that had lied about what they did during the times of the war and lied about taking parts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they were finding some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And those were the days when there was a janitor that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hyde Park</span> , I believe, I’m not quite sure where, and they found out that he was a Nazi 1n one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and they wanted to prosecute him and all his neighbors stood up and said, “Well, how can you do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="811">He’s such a good man, he’s such a good neighbor, he’s such a good janitor.” </span><span class="sentence" id="812">The fact that he committed murder the times before -- God only knows of how many, didn’t count, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="813">But maybe if he had killed their sister or their brother or their mother, he wouldn’t have been this wonderful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And I’m saying to myself, “They don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">These people don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">They weren’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He didn’t kill their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">He, like the rest, needs to pay for his crime.” </span><span class="sentence" id="819">This is a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where we need to account for our -- for ourselves, for what we’ve done. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Then my son came to me and said that he saw this article that was put in through the Holocaust foundation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skokie</span> , about asking for survivors to come forth and have their stories recorded. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And yes, I saw it many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">But those were still the days when I did not speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So all this was beginning to come to a head. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">My son needed to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">The janitor needed -- the people needed to know what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And I started to think about this and I said, “Maybe some of us do need to speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Maybe it’s going to hurt, but maybe we can set the world straight.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And when my son called and said, “Mom, you need to do this because I need to know and your grandchildren will need to know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And this is where a grandma and a mother gets caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And his words were, “Don’t ask for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Sign whatever they want you to sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Take a blank tape and ask for a copy of a tape.” </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Which is what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And I went and I was interviewed. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I remember sitting in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the very first time, coming to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to be interviewed and I was interviewed by Dr. Leon Stein, who is head of the history department, I believe, at <span class="BUILDING">Roosevelt University</span> , who has since become a friend, but this is the first time I’ve met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I remember he came there with cameras and as we started this interview, the camera broke down. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And I said, “See, I’m not supposed to be doing this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Okay, so they asked me would I come back the next day -- and I had a friend go with me the first day and the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I said, “I don’t know, you know, I don’t know that I can go through this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="840">But I did go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And we still have a tape of that first interview, which was terrible, because I couldn’t speak and it was a very bad interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">The -- the questions didn’t come the way they should. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I remember was a short interview and my friend that came with me and I went back into my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we sat down and when I got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the floodgates opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I went hysterical, crying on her shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">This 1s the first time I have given this interview and I -- it just -- it just opened this <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And then I said, “They didn’t ask me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">This is what I could have told them, that’s what I could have told them, this is what I should have said. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But they didn’t ask and I didn’t think of saying anything and I’m never giving another interview, this is too painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I cannot do this and -- and I’m never doing another interview.” </span><span class="sentence" id="850">The next day I get a call from this professor and he says to me, “You know, there’s going to be a panel discussion at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , would you come and go on this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And I go, “No, I’m not a public speaker, I don’t know how to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I am not going.” </span><span

ANSWER:  -- do this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Well, this is how it started, where I beca-gun to speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">One thing led to another and I started to go into <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and I started to go into <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , started to go into <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and I started to work with Mayor Daly, our mayor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">When Mayor Daly came into <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he had a Day of Remembrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">He was the first mayor that ever had a Day of Remembrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And I started to work with him in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and when he had a Day of Remembrance, I was his first keynote speaker at the <span class="BUILDING">Daly Center</span> and I spoke out at the <span class="BUILDING">Daly Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And then I started to work -- Mayor Daly every year has a Day of Remembrance, but prior to everybody going, what most people don’t know is that he holds a breakfast and invites two students from every <span class="BUILDING">Chicago school</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and they have a breakfast first -- beautiful breakfast and then there’s a speaker that speaks to these students first and I have been his speaker for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">This last year was the first time that I did not speak, cause I said, “Enough is enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And little by little, I have started to speak out and have realized the importance of a survivor to speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I have realized that only through survivors can the rest of the world learn, cause we were the ones that had the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I realize that as we’re getting older, there are not going to be many that can stand up and speak out and the revisionists are doing their work now. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I realize that there are hundreds of books that the revisionists are writing, calling us survivors liars, that it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">They’re on the internet today, with programs, teaching children that the Holocaust did not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">So, I have realized the importance of all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> was first in the talking stages, before there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground, I was asked to appear on Milt Rosenberg’s show and speak about the Holocaust and speak about the importance of the <span class="BUILDING">Washington Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I was one of the very first to jump onto this bandwagon and have been speaking out for the <span class="BUILDING">Washington Holocaust Museum</span> and about it’s importance, it’s teachings, where it brings children in from all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , to teach about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And now that I have gotten older, my grandchildren need to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Their grandchildren will need to know, as will yours and as will sti -- as will the generation that will be here after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And this is one of the big reasons that I speak out today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  I’m curious about when you first went to that first interview, the thing that sort of set you off on this <span class="DLF">road</span> that yo -- that you’re on now, of ta -- of talking about it, was because of your son and him wanting to know what had happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And you got a tape of that first interview made, but you said it wasn’t a very good interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Have -- did you go on to have discussions or talk to him directly about what happened, or did you -- did you leave it to the tapes, you know, I mean, especially since that first one wasn’t very satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  This is very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">When I was the keynote speaker the first time with Mayor Daly, my daughter-in-law came to listen as did some friends and family. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">My son did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I think it’s too painful for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">That was recorded, as was the first tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I’ve been on television, I’ve been in newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And the tape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">My son has never come to listen to me speak in person. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">But he has saved every little print, everything that has been written, every tape that’s been made. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And I expect a copy of this and he also wants it and he saves everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Last year, our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , where my grandchildren go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> had asked me to come and speak to the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">This is the first that my son came to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">It was like -- they gave me maybe a half hour and you speak to children and you speak different than you speak to adults, because you don’t want to send them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying that this lady scared them and Mommy calling me the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So you speak different, but my son came with his video camera, to listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">My oldest grandson chose to sit in and listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">My youngest grandchu-son -- chose not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He chose to go to his class, which he had -- which we allowed him to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I was very conscious through this entire speaking time, that my son was standing there with the camera and listen to his mother relate this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And we’ve talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">We’ve talked about different aspects of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">He’s read about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">He’s read Michael Beerenbaum’s book where I’ve been quoted and they’ve also sent it to my grandson for his -- for his Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And of course my grandchildren -- my oldest one now 1s in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and he has written about the Holocaust and he has been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">So we do speak about it, but very little, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">We don’t -- he’s watched every tape and he wants everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And he puts everything away. “</span><span class="sentence" id="905">Mom, I need a copy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="906">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But, we speak about it very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">QUESTION:  So y -- so you and your son have never sat across a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> or sat in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> or whatever, an-and --
ANSWER:  He will ask questions and I will answer them, but we’ve never had this kind of a discussion, this serious kind of a discussion, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">An-And it’s interesting, because when I was a -- first time I was on television and I came back and I said to him, “Well, what do you think?” </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And he says, “When did you start speaking with an accent?” </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I mean, this is what he -- you know, but we don’t go into the deep end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Like, I’m going back to Europe now and his question to me 1s, “Why do you want to put yourself through this? </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Why do you need to put yourself through this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="914">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And he hurts for me and he’s afraid for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So, you know, it’s -- it’s hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  Once you did start speaking about it more, did the nightmares decrease in number? </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Did it have any affect on that part of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">ANSWER:  You know, it’s interesting, cause oftentimes I speak at group meetings and I -- for fundraising for the <span class="BUILDING">Washington Holocaust Museum</span> and we get different groups of people in and they -- people analyze survivors and they’ Il sit there and they’Il stare at you and they try and analyze you. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And this particular evening, we had a group of doctors from one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and I know I’m being analyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I mean, I just -- I can feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">You don’t -- you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So we were all done and we had this small discussion afterwards and- and I don’t know one of the doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And he was asking me different questions and whatever, I don’t know how we came to it and -- and I’ve often said that probably I do need to be analyzed, cause there are many things that I -- that I cannot remember, and -- things that -- during the times of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And I looked at him and I said, “So, you analyzed me,” I said, “so what do you think?” </span><span class="sentence" id="926">He says, “Well, I think that you live with a lot of guilts.” </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I said, “Oh? </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Well, what kind of guilts do I live with?” </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And he said, “Well, survivors guilts.” </span><span class="sentence" id="930">He says, “You -- you feel guilty that you survived and a lot of people didn’t.” </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And when I hear that I -- I -- I get angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And I said, “You know,” I said, “you are reading the wrong books.” </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I said, “I don’t have any -- I may have lots of guilts that I live with, but that is not one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I did not survive at anyone’s expense. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I did not steal with anyone -- from anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I did not steal their food. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I did not kill anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I was one of the lucky ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">If there’s one thing that I don’t live with, is the fact that I survived and others didn’t.” </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I said, “So you’ve been reading the wrong books.” </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And I’ve heard this from many people, that survivors live with the guilts that they survived and others didn’t, and maybe some of us do. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I -- that -- that’s one thing I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I -- I - that’s one thing that’s n -- I don’t have, is the -- the guilt that I survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  I question it. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I question why my brothers didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I ques-question that other people didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I live with the guilt of sending my mother into the wrong <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I do not live with the guilt that I survived and others did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">So, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="953">ANSWER:  The nightmares, that was the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  It was a good answer, but --
ANSWER:  That was the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I got sidetracked. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">When I first started to speak, people told me that once I speak out, that the nightmares would go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">The answer is no. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">The nightmares have always been there and I believe the nightmares will always be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Not just for me, but for all of us that have gone this horrible route. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">My husband always knows when I have had to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">When I did a fund-raiser when I was in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it just brings it all back and the pictures all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">The screen is showing it all and you know, it doesn’t make it easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">It doesn’t make it easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">It open -- this 1s -- this is a wound that does not close. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Just because we speak about it, doesn’t make it go away, it makes it deeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">But we speak about it, because we realize the importance of speaking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">We know the wound 1s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">We don’t need to open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Survivors don’t need to open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">But what we’re trying to do, is prevent this from happening again. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And I do believe the old saying, what goes around, comes around. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Yesterday it was Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Today, they’re fighting over other things, religion, in other parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Tomorrow it might be blue eyed people, or a different ethnic group. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">But it does -- the wheel turns, it does go around. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And if we don’t speak out and if we don’t teach and if we don’t show a -- what a gun can do and if we don’t show what hatred can do, what bigotry can do, what racism can do -- then we need to live with -- with fear, with hate, all our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">We need to teach our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Our children are not born with hatred, we teach hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I don’t like you because you’re blue eyed or because you’re black or because you’re Jewish or because you’re Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I teach you, my child, to hate instead of si -- teaching them nice things, do I need to teach them to hate? </span><span class="sentence" id="982">When I go into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- when I go into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I ask these children, how many of you are guilty of tormenting someone because they’re too fat or too skinny or too blonde or they don’t meet some of your quali-qualifications? </span><span class="sentence" id="983">They don’t speak the way you think they should speak? </span><span class="sentence" id="984">What makes you the judge? </span><span class="sentence" id="985">What makes you different? </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Why do you think that you can sit in judgment of me? </span><span class="sentence" id="987">How many of you children have been guilty of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Of tormenting another child? </span><span class="sentence" id="989">You’d be surprised how many sit there and shake their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">They know. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">They know. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">But maybe I can touch a nerve.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">QUESTION:  How do you feel about -- I know that in -- you said you’ve gone back to Europe, how do you feel about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">ANSWER:  When I go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my skin crawls. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">When I look at the old Germans, I wonder where they were and what they did during that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">But that doesn’t mean that I hate the young Germans or the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">They are not the guilty ones, they didn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But I think that every one of them and the Polish people and all the other people in the world that didn’t help -- we need to remember that there were 12 million people killed during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">A million and a half babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Babies, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Somebody did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Somebody’s father did it, somebody’s grandfather did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And I want to question the young people, “Do you know what your father or your grandfather did during the time of the war?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">But that doesn’t mean that the young person of today is guilty of what their father or their grandfather did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> itself, or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> itself, just because it is <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and just because it is <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and just because this is where all the horrible atrocities were taking place, make my skin crawl.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1238">ANSWER:  I think -- there are also several reasons for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">When one loses a parent -- it is normal for a child to lose a parent, one has a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I know I have comfort, because my father is buried in a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> here and I can go and I can visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Those of us that watched our families killed in Europe, we don’t know -- we don’t have -- we can’t visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">They’re scattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">When you watch babies walking towards a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , when you watch religious people walking towards a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> as they are praying still to God when they’re walking towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , when you watch someone dig a <span class="DLF">grave</span> and then you see them shot and fall into the <span class="DLF">grave</span> they have dug for themselves, when you watch innocent blood spilled, there’s a <span class="DLF">hole</span> that there’s no cover on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">The cover will not fit, the <span class="DLF">hole</span> doesn’t close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">You live with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">It’s like an ulcer that eats away at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Some of us handle it better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Some of us live with it easier, but the wound 1s always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Maybe if we had seen a normal death, which, we expect a normal death, we would get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">But this was -- there was nothing normal about his war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">There was nothing normal about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">We cannot forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">We cannot forgive for those people that have done it and we must never forget of what has been done to the Jews, to the Gypsies, to the innocent people that got caught during the time of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">But we must re -- also remember, that maybe a lot of people would have been put in danger, had they helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">They could have helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">We must honor the people that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">We must honor the righteous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">They were the ones that stood up and said, “This is wrong, we will help.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">We must always remember those people that did stand up and did help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Unfortunately, there are not many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has honored them, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has planted <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> are not overgrowing with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">We have an Avenue of the Righteous in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Evanston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">It’s not overgrowing with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , but there were the few, there were the Schindlers, but not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And so I honor those people and I teach about those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">But we can never forgive and we can never forget, for the ones that did not help, that ni -- that did not stand up, that turned in the Jews, when they didn’t need to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">They didn’t benefit by it, other than taking our possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Is it worth to give a life for possessions? </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">I hope that the ones that are still living, that committed the crimes, I hope that they think about what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">I hope they live with it every single day, in their minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I hope they can see the bloodshed that was done and not forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And I hope we can all learn from the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">QUESTION:  Actually, I had one more question, if you don’t mind me asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">That was a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> to end, but there was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">You triggered something in my mind, which was, in your video interview, you mentioned every day having to run, in front of Dr. Mengele or Dr. Mengele’s lieutenants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And -- you know, off and on, through the years, there were stories, possible sightings of him, you know, people searching for Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">It was maybe- what was it, maybe 10 years ago or 15 years ago, where supposedly they found these bones in -- where was it, <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , I think, and --
ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Paraguay</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1279">QUESTION:  Yeah, and some of that was happening, I believe, during the period where you were being silent about your experiences in the Holocaust and when that -- when -- when you would -- did you ever encounter these stories in the news or whatever and I’m ju -- I just was curious --
ANSWER:  About Dr. Mengele?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1280">QUESTION:  Yeah, about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1281">ANSWER:  About the death of Dr. Mengele or what --
QUESTION:  Or before that, you know, it was like, where is he? </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">There were -- you know, every once in awhile there’d be a story that oh, he was seen in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> or he was possibly in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , there were people hunting for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I mean, I was just curious whether --
ANSWER:  People hunting for him and people hiding him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1284">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1285">ANSWER:  And there are many others that are being hidden in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And it’s amazing, because they are le -- still living in freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I mean, some of them might be older now, but I -- I do believe that they need to pay for their crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Dr. Mengele, I believe -- I’m not sure that there has been proof that those were -- that he died and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I would have loved to have seen him taken alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">It would have been a great day if they had taken him alive and if he could have paid a little bit for some of the crimes that he committed, some of the experiments that he did, some of the atrocities that -- that have come out that he has done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">But, unfortunately he died without -- without -- okay, so he dow -- died in drowning, but big deal, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">He should have felt some of -- of the pain that he caused for so many, many hundreds of pe -- of people, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">But yeah, he -- he -- Dr. Mengele was one of the doctors that did the selection and -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And he did the experiments on pregnant women and -- and he did a lot of the experiments without drugs and -- and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">He was one of the doctors and -- with his entourage that would -- would have selections in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">We would have to get undressed and not walk, but run in front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">But we knew there was going to be a selection and oftentimes when our hair started to grow back and -- and then somebody’s hair would be gray, we would take dirt and rub it into that person’s head and hair -- to try and cover the gray hair so they looked younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">We would try and pinch cheeks to show that they -- we still had a little color in our face, that we didn’t look so pale and dead, even though we were hungry and hardly had any strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">But let me tell you, strength came from somewheres when there were selections, because not -- we did not walk, we ran in front of them -- Dr. Mengele, as he stood there with his entourage, with his stick and -- and pointing one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And some went into one <span class="DLF">line</span> and some into another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">One never knew which was the good <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">One -- one <span class="DLF">line</span> went directly to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , while the other <span class="DLF">line</span> walked back into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">But he was one of the -- one of the big players in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and -- and I’m really sorry that he didn’t stand trial and didn’t pay for his crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1304">QUESTION:  I’m curious about -- about you, though and whether these stories or mentions of him in the news or whatever, would --
ANSWER:  Well, every time -- actually, every time we did hear about him and -- and it brought back memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Just the name itself, you know, Dr. Mengele, my God, you know, you can visualize this man standing there with his gloves and his -- and his stick in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">I mean, I can just see him in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And the prayer was always there, please catch him, please get him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And I know they’ve gotten close to getting him [indecipherable] but you know -- and then, it hurt when -- when I heard and read afterwards -- read afterwards that his son visited him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">He had a son who -- who knew where he was and his son visited him and -- and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And I kept saying, “Sure, he,” you know, “he’s -- he’s still living a good life and look what he did to all the other people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">But there are many of them that are still living, you know, and denying, and -- [knocking] It’s open.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1312">QUESTION:  Well, we were sort of at the end of our interview anyway, so now that the plumber is here to -- which sink is it that he’s looking at?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">ANSWER: <span class="INT_SPACE"> Bathroom</span> .</span></p>
