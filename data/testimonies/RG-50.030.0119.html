class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , and they were going on this, on this <span class="DLF">road</span> which were, the purpose of this was that there were <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , and uh <span

fruitful their <span class="DLF">gardens</span> and their <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They should be better food then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Was this mud from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe</span> that they had brought up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Yes, brought it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And it was in there riding, you must keep up this, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And running for another. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And so it was, it was just a circle of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Todes Runde (ph) And so the only, the only uh rest was when somebody couldn't and he collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That you couldn't go, only you could keep the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> on this 30 centimeter wide <span class="DLF">plank road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So he collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And when he collapsed, so the whole <span class="DLF">road</span> collapsed, couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So the kappos came and they beat this man who collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You will go or not go, and so maybe he make some two or three rounds and he collapse and there were every day twenty, thirty dead which we brought in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> exhausted, yes, from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So our group of five we survived in this way - that the possibility of us if you could read the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> to give the <span class="DLF">road</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> , to run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> it was very exhausting, it was very hard that somebody could keep it without uh rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So we always could uh changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">The kappos allowed that if somebody of our five, un voluntarily he told I will give up my <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the shovel (ph) to this man with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And so we could give it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Do you understand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  Yes, so by changing with the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> you
ANSWER:  So, and so we could survive, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But later it was very hard and my brother-in-law, he collapsed and he came to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> and he was, he caught the dysentary and he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He died in September 1941, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And later I also get uh, poison, blood poison, from this dirty mud, and I had uh, , blood poison, so I still have a sign here. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And they would amputate my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But still I have a connection with this, from this <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> , of a nurse who was connected with the Skopsiva, knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And uh, I told him that going, he make me, he gave me something that a <span class="DLF">hole</span> which was put in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It came out and I was cured. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And then after somebody was cured, so he got as they needed to the working power, yes, So also to Jews they give a to spare him a little. , </span><span class="sentence" id="325">1t meant, it should be spared it should be easier work. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But for Jews the easier work that you must, uh beat the stones, to small pieces, to silt (ph), but, and in every weather, it 1s raining and not raining, it was for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">But, luckily, as my name was Erich Schon at the time, so they told that I am a German, so they give me the work for non-Jews from German. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And it was the you know, to repair the socks for SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It was a hugeh and so I got this work and in two months I could restore my health. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And, but, and then it came, there came Ukrainians (ph) like in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and so on, and this old guard ought to be changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Yes, and the Russians and the prisoners of war and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And so our group get the better work, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And I also can, yes I had to do with wood, so I told them, carpenter, so I could help by the building of a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and later I get the, they built a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , they built near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they built a new camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they kept the market(ph) at as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prisoners war camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And there were the same <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and firms which were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> brought their machinery <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and they used the prisoners that they work on the machinery that they make for uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U-boats</span> , you know, under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Some machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And for Jews it was not, Jews, only non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But later when they still needed us, and under the surveillance of you know of , the military in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But still we came, we were in the uh direction of the SS only by night, but on the day we were in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which was nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And the Germans, they were, they were interested in work, in really work. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And so they couldn't beat us, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">When they would have, and so I learned some skill in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And later 1t came, I was there still till the end of October, 1t came an order from Himmler, you know, the boss of the SS, that all the Jews should be concentrated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And so it come the order also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme</span> and so they have

<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Who brought the eggs and the sausage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  The civil workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">The civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">You know, who was, they were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they were not so guarded, and they could get from the farmers and so on, and also money was there, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So this, the people who were gassed, they had much money and they were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And the kappos came to this and they had an organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">They knew how to get on this, uh, this belongings, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And this, uh this, Winand (ph) he, for instance, he organized the Schnaps (ph), this liquor, yes, and he told, look, take this liquor in this uh our box (ph), that we have the tools and bring it to this and this kappo (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And we didn't knew how dangerous this is. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We didn't know what he send us. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So we thought, and we were not catched at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So we were, yes, we were in his protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And as I , SO I have these twenty marks, you still remember, and we told him, so the kappo (ph) 1s so nice to us, yes, and we should give him a present. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So we five, our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So we decided, we did, Willie Nachtman and I, we would go to this Winand (ph), this kappo, he had his own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we came to him, and uh, he had very good supper with rootgaren (ph), with sausages, and this, this, and we told him, look, you are very nice to us, and we will give you present. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And we brought him this, this, this twenty marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And he laughed and he brought a bundle of and he light his cigarette with this, cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">See. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">The shock from him was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">A bundle of, of . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So he laughed. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But he saw that we are , It's O.K., it's O.K., so I will, you can rely on me, and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And so later, and later there was a need of slosher, there was a need of installers, tilers, of electricians, and so it came and built, and they make a maintenance squad, prisoners maintenance squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And the uh sharfthrer (ph), an SS man, and he asked us to keep all technical installment in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And so he always took a professional for every, and we worked then regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We had a, a workshop, and so we knew the organization, we had connections to the kappos, and so we observed what is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So during this two years, this twenty-eight months exactly, so I could observe, and we were going from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">There were several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And we had a boomshk (ph), you know, a permit, that we are authorized to repair these pipes and this and this and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And we always get from this sharfthrer (ph) a letter where we should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">By the time we could choose alone the work where we will go, and we brought him always something, what he would have, a gold or something, what will you bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">He knew, he used us to organize for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">From Kanada (ph), from sonderkommando so. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And by this, we, we, the best , we had no hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">We had so many to eat that we could support about twenty others, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And when we came in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , there were in every <span class="INT_SPACE">camp kitchen</span> forty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> of uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam kettles</span> , where it was cooked, the food for all these prisoners, and uh, they asked we should repair these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> , and by the time we learned how to, in the beginning we didn't know nothing, but later we knew how to handle it, to repair and we always get some food for this repairing, from the SS men, from the accessory men, that they were, couldn't handle it and they needed it and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And so we could organize food for other people and to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But then I saw what it was not possible that we could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I saw it was not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="647">That we were secret keeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">like the sonderkommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We see so much, so we got on the list of secret keepers. (</span><span class="sentence" id="651">Secret keepers?) </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Secret keepers, bearers (ph), ah, yes, you know, secret bearers (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And we knew, we should be killed, we should be shot, and there were some periods that they would exchange us. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But the other ober _fthrer (ph), he was interested first that the work is running and secondly that organize the valuables which he always wanted valuables. ( ) </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Yes from this, from this also special. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So he keeped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And so, that we, we, were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> (ph), and we were from that we must give them all the reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So what I observed every day I came to the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> , I saw the selections exactly, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  Back up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You said that saw the cremetorium being built. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Describe, can you talk about how it was built, and when, and when the first gassings started in the cremetorium itself?</span></p>
