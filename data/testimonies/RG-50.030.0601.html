<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Your name was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But I've not used it because that's what my father would call me when he was very strict with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don't have a good association with it.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What year were you born? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">When is your birthday?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  In 1925, June 16th. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was a very good time of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , right in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  So what was your childhood like? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Tell me your earliest memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, there was my father and my mother and my older brother who was five years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And then a stepbrother, Paul, who was much order, 17 years older, who really didn't live with us, but he was part of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And my father was much older than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My father was 18 years older than my mother, and so he always seemed more like my grandfather to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And my mother was 35 when I was born, so compared to how I felt at 35 or see other people being 35 now, she seemed much older, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> right in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And so my father was a lawyer, an attorney, and he had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> -- I think we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> -- I'm not sure — of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And he had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the mezzanine of that same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , so he would always come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for lunch at 1:00 o'clock, around the time that I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And that was our main meal at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And in those days, children did not go out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">There was always somebody with me, a Fraulein type. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I was taken everywhere, to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and ice skating. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My father took me ice skating. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And there was no such thing as really playing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But we did take summer vacations, lengthy summer vacations to either a different part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And so then I think we were able to play freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But during the year, we were pretty constricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My brother and I were not too close. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The ideas in those days made a lot of difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And he was an ardent boy scout and he thought all of my interests were silly and superficial. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But whenever I was sick -- and I seemed to have been sick a good deal in those days with colds and flu and so forth - he would play games and especially chess with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And I just recently picked it up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So that's been fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I don't remember much about it except for a gym teacher who was very -- who looked more like a snowman or a snowwoman. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">She was built that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I never liked <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So I think that was four grades or five grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And then I went to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I believe it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luithlen</span> , L-U-I-T-H-L-E-N. And somehow, even though Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after awhile when Hitler came, I think I remained in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there somehow until I could leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  So the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that you attended, were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And then in this <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> we had religion classes, and they were done with release time. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">In other words, the Protestant children would go one <span class="NPIP">place</span> for instruction and the Catholic children to another and the Jewish children to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And that's when I began to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My parents really didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They would go to their parents or my father's parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> occasionally over the -- the Yom Kippur, over the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But otherwise, no, there wasn't much celebration of holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And in fact, we had a Christmas tree for many years until I made my mother buy a menorah when I was old enough to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And then when I was a tween or an early teenager, we would go to children's services, the young people's services at the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ViennA</span> : But I must have went -- I think I went mostly for the boys who also attended and then we could all go skating afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So I didn't take all that very seriously at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My earliest memory of there being something wrong politically or worrying about what's going to happen to Jewish people was I think in 1934 when I remember going on vacation by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with my parents to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Gastein</span> , a resort-type thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And we got there the evening, at night when it was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was in the valley, and we came down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> or <span class="DLF">hill</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , were lit up and there were candles in the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And apparently a chancellor from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and his name was Dollfuss, had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I don't know whether he died or was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But he was known to be very sympathetic to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And so it was eerie that he was so mourned or so celebrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I guess those lights are something I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And also because my father was older he would always worry about whether he'd die before my mother and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And he worried a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">My mother was a worrywart, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I've become a worrywart as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I married one. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I married one, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But my father was always worried about the times or money or clients or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And he was very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He was quite an intellectual person. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He was always reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So there was really very little game playing in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> except occasionally my brother and I. And the only sport was ice skating. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And then I went to gymnastic classes as a little girl next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And swimming, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So somehow when Hitler came to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and was practically invited into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , somehow it wasn't a surprise because we had always lived with that kind of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So I don't know what else I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I had a few good friends, but the friends I had went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but they lived other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So it wasn't like you could get together after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">You had to make a play date or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">A little older than a play date. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And one friend, Francie, did come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I did see her once or twice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Oh, and another friend, Eva Schiffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">She was a real intellectual. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My father adored her. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And she lived around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And my grades were always compared to hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I think she's a retired professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amherst</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Andover</span> now, and we are out of touch, although we were back in touch in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And then one friend went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , and we completely lost touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And a boy I liked whet to <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So everybody was spread out. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">There was no cohesiveness. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I think even now I envy some of my friends who grew up in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and had their <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> crowd and go to reunions and all these memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So I don't have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So I don't know what else should I tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  So do you remember feeling -- you didn't — did you recognize or celebrate any Jewish holidays in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Well, we then eventually bought a menorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I don't remember celebrating Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">No, really, I don't think we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Were a lot of your friends Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Yeah, they were all Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  So growing up did you experience any anti-Semitism 1n your --
ANSWER:  Notimmediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Not among my friends, I didn't, because I guess I just didn't -- wasn't open to that because there was nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we had non-Jewish help, Frauleins and so forth, a housekeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But I didn't experience anything from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And of course, they had to leave as soon as Hitler came. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Other people in my life, my gym teacher, my aunt was my piano teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And they were all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But we talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And my father would talk about the things that Hitler did. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we would -- this is before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but we were aware of the Nuremburg laws and of what happens, and you know, and how you have to -- how you can't work any more and you can't have any non-Jewish help. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">My father had to get rid of his secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He had one secretary who was with him for 30 years or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But personally, I can't say I experienced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My main experience was years later when I visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> the first time, I think, in '69. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Do you want to hear that story? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Uh-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  With my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And since he didn't speak German, we couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , but we went to a lot of operas. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And so one night we went to the operA: And we also stayed at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> right across from the operA: We didn't have time to eat beforehand, so we went to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> nearby there afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I think generally in there when a <span class="NPIP">place</span> is crowded, they don't have you necessarily wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They seat you with somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And so we were seated with this man who was a bit older than I am, maybe 10, 15 years older than I was at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Started talking somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I spoke a little broken German. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And he said, "Oh, how come your German is so good?" </span><span class="sentence" id="138">or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I said, "Well, I'm glad you think it's good." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I said, "I used to live here." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And he said, "Oh?" </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I said, "Well, I left in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I had to leave when Hitler came to AustriA:" And so he said, "Oh," and then he fell silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Oh, and he had been some kind of movie producer or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Anyway, he became silent and five minutes later he got up. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And it felt very chilly. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The Austrians were never overly friendly, and they were more Nazis than the Germans were, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So again, it was not surprising, but at the same time it was extremely uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And just such a tiny little incident that I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So I think if I had experienced more incidents and more graphic incidents, I would have remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But I just did not happen to be with people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  How did the Nuremburg laws or I guess the Nazi rise to power, how did it affect you and your family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Well, my father I think not being able to have anybody working for you who 1s even partially Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So that was the big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And that meant that — you know, we had household help, a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And everybody was very loyal and friendly and they suddenly had to disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">For my father, no help in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was shrinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He was upset about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And so there wasn't anybody in my family, whether -- we were just Jewish, so that wasn't in question, whether we had a grandfather or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So I think that was the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">What else was in there? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I forgot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  You said that your father talked about the things that Hitler was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Were you aware of the Naziism and what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">As I look back, we were very politically aware as children or teenagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Much more so than I later found kids either in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> being. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Yeah, we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And then, of course, when the annexation started. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And my mother's half-sister lived, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , her husband, and he was -- I mean, they were very well- situated. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He was the president of a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And they refused to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I mean, this whole business over what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">In fact, I had an uncle and an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ViennA</span> : And he was a government employee. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I guess he was half Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He thought it would never happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And they didn't leave, and they perished in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">My aunt and uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> left in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Their children made them leave just in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Do you recall -- What are your memories of Hitler coming to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Do you recall when the change happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I remember that something — he immediately took over the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , the one means of communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I remember -- of course there were a lot of Nazi soldiers around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they were marching in the <span class="DLF">Ringstrasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And then real fear settled in because we then -- well, it was after Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I guess I heard about Kristallnacht later. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I didn't see any of those terrible things happening on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But then we began to be really afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The person in power was the superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And it was a question of whether he was going to be our friend or foe. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And everything depended on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And so I think we were all in fear that he would say yes, such and such, the Grosses living there, Jewish, and go take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But fortunately that never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">My brother actually left the year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He left soon after Hitler came to power, and he went tom <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and later on to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BoliviA</span> : So I was the only one left at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And my stepbrother had married. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And he was -- my father's first wife was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So my stepbrother for certain didn't grow up Jewish, but he didn't grow up with anything else either, just nondenominational. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And he married a Jewish woman, one whose sister and brother-in- law actually emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">His biological mother was related to a very prominent Czech shoe manufacturer. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And they were willing to help them get out, but only if he -- if they both converted and didn't ever acknowledge their Jewish family any more, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But everybody had to survive in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That's what they had to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Do you recall --
ANSWER:  You go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  -- when the decision was made that you would leave on the Kindertransport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  Well, I think it was somehow made early in the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Early '39, it must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But the understanding -- all this was, it didn't seem like such a tragic thing because the understanding always was that my parents would come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> two months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And then after I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British quarter</span> was closed so they couldn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they very fortunately were able to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And my father subsequently died here two years later, so I never did see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But the good-byes were not that terrible because it was like, "So long. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I'm going to see you in a couple of months."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  What kind of preparation went into it? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I mean, did you pack? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Did your mother do it for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">What was the feeling in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Well, ironically, it was kind of up. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We bought clothes and packed clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You're going to need this and you're going to need that. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And so it was a rather positive preparation. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Kind of naive, really, when you think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So I did not understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  How old were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  I was 13 by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I understood, but I didn't expect a long separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And then my relationship with my father, while it had always been good, you know, he was really overwhelmed by anxiety and worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I remember him being very short and angry with me a lot of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And so I do remember the feeling of, oh, good, I can get out of here kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And he did not come to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">My mother sent me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">In retrospect, it might just have been too hard for him to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But it was a way also of getting distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  What are your memories of saying good-bye to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  Well, again, it was a really warm and hugging good-bye, but it wasn't terribly sad because it was either denial or it was "I'm going to see you in a couple of months." </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So from what I've been reading -- and I just don't remember other kids and their parents in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">It was terrible for some kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And then there's that story in that one movie about the father pulling the daughter out of the --
QUESTION:  "Into the Arms of Strangers." </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I just watched it yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I recall that story when he pulled her out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  Did you read the book? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It's a very readable, a nice book, very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  What are your memories of the journey to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Well, foggy. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Just sitting with a lot of kids on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and wearing my name tag. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Some people remember their number. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I don't remember my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And then some -- When we got to the -- what was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The German -- the <span class="DLF">German border</span> I don't remember so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">There wasn't a <span class="DLF">border</span> , I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But then the German-Dutch border was — there were border guards who came on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">board</span> , and it was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And we thought maybe we wouldn't get through or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And somehow -- I remember most of this being at night, but I think maybe we did travel at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">People say when you get old your long-term memory is very good, but for me my short- or my long-term isn't very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And so I remember that anxiety and those guards walking through and being very relieved afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And so then we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and got onto their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I was very seasick so I don't remember anything good about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And then when I got there, some cousins of my mother's -- I don't remember whether they met me in -- what's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we landed in? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">When we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Anyway, when I got off the whole Kindertransport, they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And I stayed with them for a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And then I met my foster parents, who had been arranged for by my cousin, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheltenham</span> , which was west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  What was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  And also I got there at the end of that school year. </span><span class="sentence" id="294"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> was -- eventually, I liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Of course, we had to wear school uniforms, which was totally strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I learned to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> so that I could -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was at the other end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It was a couple of miles on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And gradually I made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I think I felt very strange and different at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Plus, I don't think they ever had seen a Jewish person before. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I'm not sure that my foster parents had, except that there was -- the MP from that <span class="REGION">area</span> was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The name was Lipson. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So it took a while, but then I had a couple of good friends in time, Megan and Audrey. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I did like most of the teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It was an all girls school. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">In the summer I| think I went on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , the <span class="DLF">farm</span> of a friend of theirs or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I don't know what I did there, but I quite liked that for a couple of summers. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I don't remember many -- I've not thought about that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I don't remember many after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I don't know what I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  Did you experience any air raids or bombings or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  Well, really not because we were -- there was I think only one time I remember the sirens really going off. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We were 100 miles west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and we were pretty much immune.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="327"><span class="REGION">Long Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And her sister — one sister, the Prague sister, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jackson Heights</span> so that was across the way right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And my mother lived -- they lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">When I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I lived with her in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">She had a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> /<span class="INT_SPACE">sitting room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And there was another woman that she shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with when there was no money to speak of. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">My mother worked in a <span class="BUILDING">hat factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She did sewing and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And my father was too old to take the law exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I think there was some help for refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I think they lived on that and my mother's earnings. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Not much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Yeah, but not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But the bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And my brother and my stepbrother joined the U.S. Army from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They had the long way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They eventually came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and he joined the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And he was stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and I would see him on occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And the last time I saw him before he went over was June 6th, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">When was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> ? '</span><span class="sentence" id="350">41 or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We met up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Went to a tea dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">That's what people did then. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And then he went overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So we knew about the bombings and the invasions and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Well, we knew that terrible things happened to Jewish people, but I don't think we knew exactly what, which seems strange, doesn't it?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Did he stay there?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  Did he eventually move to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  He came to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> I think a year before I got married, which was '48. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So he must have come in '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And then he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rensselaer</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Overall, what was your -- would you say your experience in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with your foster family was positive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was definitely positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I mean, the flip side was, you know, I felt that I always had to be a good girl because if I didn't walk the straight and narrow, then -- a lot of kids got kicked out of their <span class="BUILDING">foster homes</span> , from reading all these various books. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Have you read -- well, there are a whole lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">What's the name? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Siegel wrote a book?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  Oh--
ANSWER:  Lorrie Siegel, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And then there was one about a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I forget what that was called.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  Lorrie Siegel wrote the book in other <span class="BUILDING">people's homes</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  Yes, you're right. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I think she was in different <span class="BUILDING">foster homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So you know, I think that- and I probably had a tendency to be a good girl anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Those were my father's expectations. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It was very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And there was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And then they didn't really get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I remember my foster mother saying, when I was about 16, she said -- she asked me whether I wouldn't want to convert. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And I said -- she said, "Because then you wouldn't have any trouble and then all your problems were because you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">If there weren't any Jewish people, there wouldn't be any problems." </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It was something naive like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It wasn't anti Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It was naive, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And I was very hurt and angry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I remember that being the first and, I think, the only time I must admit that I fasted on Yom Kippur, just to prove that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Not that they ever knew about it or cared, but I felt better for doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And I think I had to prove to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But basically it was that I think they had led a rather insulated life and didn't understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  There weren't any other Jewish people in the community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  Well, eventually, when I was 16 I graduated,<span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I found that there wasmfree <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> organization or something and that they were young people who eventually intended to go back to AustriA: Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And they were all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It was kind of a group leader, a woman and her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They were also Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Their name was Leichner. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And so then I started associating with Jewish kids, and that became rather insular. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">That was a rather left-wing group. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We read Karl Marx and all kinds of discussions and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But it felt more like I belonged than the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  Do you recall when the war ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Well, I came over here before the war ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  My mother made application for hardship reasons in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and got me. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I came here the year of 1944, November '44, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that took two weeks on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I was so seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But she was able to get me to here. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And so then I remember -- I don't know where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But the war ended a year later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  What was it like leaving your foster family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  Well, I had left earlier, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I had left probably a year or two before I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> because I got -- my second job was -- my first job was at an <span class="BUILDING">egg grading station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And my second job was for the Signal Corps because the Signal Corps had come to the -- the U.S. Signal Corps, because they had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and made their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheltenham</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And since my foster mother made me take typing and shorthand, when I graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I got a job, a secretarial job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And I made quite a few friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And when those guys left to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Grosvenor House</span> , I went with. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I more or less said good-bye to them at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And that was probably in the spring of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I think I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> maybe six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So I said good-bye at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And then my husband and I went back one time many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And my foster father had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And she was living in a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> and had pretty advanced Alzheimer's so that she didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But she eventually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">My husband, he was very good with her, and he was able to somehow refresh her memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Either that or she pretended. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And also when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , one of the first things I did was her daughter and husband lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I went down to see them and meet them, and we corresponded. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We sent Christmas letters to each other until she died last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So that was what, 40, 50 years or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So she just died recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">She was 10 years older than I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  So you were able to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1944?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  What was it like coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Well, again, overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I really didn't want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">As much as I wanted to see my mother, I felt I had friends there and roots there. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And it was another wrench. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But then also my mother and I had some difficulty at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">First of all, living in small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And I think she was getting her little girl back. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">That's what she thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I was 18 and felt grown up and independent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  How long had you been -- was it like four --
