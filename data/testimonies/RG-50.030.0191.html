<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you state your name, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Milner Roberts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Can we have a little background information from you, General Roberts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Well, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> in September of 1918 and spent most of my early life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , and from there I went to <span class="BUILDING">Lehigh University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethlehem</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> where I majored in metallurgy and had a minor in English and journalism, and also you might say a minor in military. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I was commissioned a second lieutenant infantry reserve in May of 1940, when war was already raging in Europe, and they weren't calling us up at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">So I went into industry and worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> for a while for a machine tool manufacturer -- was assigned to the Chrysler tank arsenal where they were making the brand new medium <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , then called the General Grant. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Our tools were being used to machine parts of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">On December 7th, 1941, I was minding my own business, driving down one of the major <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> listening to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> radio, and Pearl Harbor was announced. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So I thought, well, Roberts, look around. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">You're not going to be around here very long, which turned out to be very accurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That happened to be a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">he next day I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">tank arsenal</span> and there was an ordnance lieutenant colonel there in charge for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He knew I was a reserve officer and he said, "Roberts, why don't you go and put your uniform on? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Come by, I'll put you to work," and I said, "Well, that's a nice idea, but I don't think the infantry would really like that and, furthermore, my father wouldn't like that either because he was a combat officer in World War I and he thinks that I ought to be a combat officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So thanks very much." </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So sure enough, in about a week, they sent me preliminary orders and I reported at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> , <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> where I went through a course to start with and then became an instructor in weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And from April, 1942 until June of 1943, I taught OSC, the general art of handling machine guns and related items. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And by June of 1943 I was thinking, gee, I'm here on a <span class="BUILDING">training base</span> and there's action elsewhere, and if I don't get out of here, the war might be over. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So I put in for the airborne and next thing I knew I was a glider infantry company commander assigned to a newly organized airborne division at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Bragg</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So I went through all of the glider training for the next six months, and then the War Department, as it was called in those days, decided that they had made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They had too many glider elements and not enough parachute elements. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So they said, we're going to break up this glider regiment and send you guys to Europe because they may need you over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So in the end of March or early April, 1944, I found myself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bristol</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , earmarked for the 101st Airborne Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Well, actually, I didn't look forward to flying over the <span class="REGION">English Channel</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider</span> but, anyway, that was the assignment until about five days before the actual attack, which people had been talking about for literally years. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">When is the second front going to open? </span><span class="sentence" id="26">When are you going into Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I found myself assigned as a tactical aide to the commander of what turned out to be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> , and this was a General Leonard Gerow, commanding the Fifth Army Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So he said, "Roberts," he said, "Do you know how to read a map?" </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I said, "Yes, sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He said, "You know how to read a photo map?" </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I said, "That in particular, because in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> , you didn't have any handy dandy maps with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">You had aerial photos -- about all you had." </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We'll give you the job." </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So I landed on D-Day with elements of the 16th Infantry in the First Division right in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was called the Easy Red section.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  A misnomer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Well, in a way it was a misnomer from the point of being easy, but from the point of view of being red, it had something along that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They divided the <span class="DLF">beachhead</span> into different sections, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, and George, and then each one of those with the red and white type, all for planning purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So without going into any great detail, I survived D- Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Then for the rest of the campaign in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , I would be sent out with elements of our combat forces every day and then report back to the general on what I had observed. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And this was a period when we were stalemated for awhile in what was called the Hedgerow area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , but we finally made a breakout in July at and within a matter of about 10 days, we had swung around and headed east and actually bottled up almost the whole German seventh army in an <span class="REGION">area</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falaise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was the so- called <span class="DLF">Falaise gap</span> , and we effectively destroyed the German resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because -- it wasn't true for the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but it certainly was true for that section of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , west of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Seine River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then we were given the opportunity to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on the 25th of August, 1944, and that was a great occasion but we didn't stay long. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They said, well, now, you guys go chasing Germans east of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So within a matter of about three days, we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sedan</span> , which had been featured in World War I, and then we really didn't have too much effective resistance in our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> , which is a pleasant little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we got there and we were stopped at what the Germans call the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> , which is a <span class="DLF">line</span> of fortifications somewhat parallel to the <span class="DLF">French Maginot Line</span> but somewhat removed from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The principle reason we were stopped was because we were running out of our fuel and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Our <span class="DLF">supply line</span> went all the way back to the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> and it became difficult to really move forward and have supplies catch up. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Furthermore, there was a fair amount of opposition further south. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">After General Patton's Third Army got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metz</span> , it was stalemated for a relatively short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And then there were some problems in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vosges Mountains</span> further south. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The northern advance had been faster than the southern advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And then I was relieved from my assignment as an aide because General Gerow had been head of the War Plans Division at the time of Pearl Harbor, and the first Pearl Harbor Inquiry in the Congress was made in that fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So they call him back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and he said, "Roberts, what do you want to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I said, "Well, sir, what I really want to do is to match my old man's accomplishment, who got to be a major in World War I. So I would like to get promoted." </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I'll put you in a staff section where you can have the opportunity to get promoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So at that point, he put me in what was called G-5, Military Government Civil Affairs Operation of the Corps, and I continued in that until the end the of the war when I was reassigned to the G-2 section, which is intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So we got involved with the Battle of the Bulge, very heavily involved on the northern shoulder, and we were confronted with the 12th S.S. Panzer division, sometimes called Hitler Jugend. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had already been in touch with a couple of other S.S. Panzer divisions, the Ist Panzer division of Adolph Hitler and the 2nd Das Reich and we were accustomed to these guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We also had been up against some of their elite units -- 3rd Parachute Division and other kinds of divisions -- but the northern shoulder held pretty well.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And by February, we were straightening out the <span class="DLF">line</span> and ready to move to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We got to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> in early March of 1945, particularly to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remagen</span> where the Germans tried to blow up the <span class="DLF">railroad bridge</span> but failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They seriously weakened it, but not enough to prevent a number of our people from crossing over and getting a beachhead on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , which was significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The 69th Division is the one that actually crossed that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We then put <span class="DLF">pontoon bridges</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuwied</span> , which was quite a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> is a very fast-moving <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> , four or five miles an hour, which, if you try to put <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pontoons</span> across it, it takes a little doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We had two of them across there, one east bound, one west bound. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuwied</span> that we first ran across some very unhappy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">These were not political refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They were prisoners of war who had been poorly treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They were all emaciated, not in very good shape, but at least they were alive and we- that was a portrait, a kind of a little future look at what we might find later. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So we then circled around and completed the southern pincer of the Ruhr envelopment. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The <span class="REGION">Ruhr area</span> -- heavily industrial, Krupp works, this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And we closed the <span class="DLF">gap</span> and captured tens of thousands of prisoners, and it was obvious that the end was coming along pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So after that we headed east again and against limited opposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I can recall going through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> , a pretty good size <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The main <span class="DLF">street</span> was probably four miles long, and in that entire four miles, I didn't find one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was still intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">There were a lot of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with the <span class="DLF">walls</span> up but the roofs burned off. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It had been pretty heavily damaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> , we found an <span class="BUILDING">airplane production plant</span> that was still going strong until we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So the Germans still had considerable capability even though they had been very heavily bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But just about the time we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> , we found a very hideous sight, and that was an <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadamar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadamar</span> had been an ordinary institution for the mentally infirm probably back to maybe 1900, but after Hitler came to power in 1933 and began his pogrom against the Jews, he also found it convenient to try to get rid of a lot of non-Jews who were political opponents. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So sometime in the late '30s, they passed a law which said that if you were found to be insane, you would be assigned to an <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> where you would be eliminated; because the theory was that the insane people might procreate and their progeny then would injure the purity of the Nordic race. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I think that was the theory. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You know, it's almost laughable, this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Anyway, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadamar</span> , we found just mounds of clothing, men and women's clothing, and at that point, no bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They had already disposed of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But we found something else, the S.S. Totenkopf elements of the S.S. divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Well, actually, it was a separate organization for prison guards- had taken skulls and with a band saw, had cut them around about this <span class="REGION">area</span> , and then there was a little depression in the resulting top of the skull. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And they had used these to have toasts to the greater glorification of the Reich, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Well, that's pretty hard to believe, that kind of a thing, but there it was. ' </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The aforementioned divisions comprised units of the German Sixth SS Panzer Army under the command of SS Colonel Josef Dietrich.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Did you inspect the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  I did not, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Some of our other people did but I didn't have really enough time to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But I did see the skulls, which made a great impression on everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We began to grasp then the awful dimensions of what evidently had been going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Did you inspect the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Do you know whether there were any <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> or any other facilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">There were <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> because that's how they dispose of these people, but not on the scale of an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> or any of these other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">This was a somewhat limited operation but, nevertheless, just as deadly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Do you know how they disposed of the bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  I think they buried them in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They certainly didn't bury them individually. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I don't think that -- I don't know what the final report was. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I didn't see it, but that's our impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They certainly didn't have individual burials. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I think they just buried them in a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> , other than the ones they burned up. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Anyway, we further -- went further east, and it was just at that time that Franklin Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> listening to the armed forces network when they announced that Roosevelt died, which really was a profound shock to everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I think it was the 13th of April, either the 12th or the 13th, and we were dismayed at the fact that he was the leader who had decided that he was going to carry out the four freedoms and we were in the process of doing part of that, and he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we had little knowledge of Harry Truman so -- but we couldn't afford to think about it too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We had other things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So we proceeded over towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> , a famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university town</span> going back hundreds of years, and it was a pleasure to note that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> wasn't damaged much. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">By the time you go through a lot of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village towns</span> that have been terribly shot up, it gets depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was not badly shot up except for the <span class="BUILDING">Bahnhof</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , which 1s always a point of attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And it was there that I was assigned to take the surrender of a German general who had passed the word that he would like to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It turned out that he had been injured on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> and been sent back to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for recuperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And now with his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> completely in the possession of the Americans, he felt he better opt to surrender rather than being forced to. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I and my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> driver went up to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> driver, by the way, was a young Jewish boy named Harry Adler. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I'll have more on him later. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I went up to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and the general in full regalia -- he was a General Korps Infantrie, which is the same as a three star general. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He'd been a German corps commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">He came out in his full regalia with his hat on and the uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">He saluted. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I saluted him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He then ceremoniously presented me with his Luger, which I said, "Fine, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Get out and get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And then he said, "I can get in the back." </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I said, "No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I think you ought to ride in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I'll be in the back." </span><span class="sentence" id="138">For all I know, he might have had another Luger. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So then he said, "Well, now, I have to see your general." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">All this was in German and Harry Adler was translating. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So I said, "Well, we'll see." </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I took him to a P.W. cage as it was called, just an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> for prisoners, and I turned the general over to those people and that's the last I saw of him; except later on I heard he was highly incensed because they wouldn't permit him to talk to our general. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He was briefed by probably some captain -- or debriefed. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He didn't know much. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He'd been out of action for two or three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> driver, Harry Adler. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Harry was born of a Jewish family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I suppose about 1925, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So as a youth in the mid-'30s, his father thought, I don't like the way things are going here. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So I think it was about 1938, the family got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and went into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And so young Adler was sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , what turned out to be <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span> , and then he, of course, then learned to speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But about the time of the Vichy surrender to the Nazis, the father said,"This isn't very good either. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Let's see 1f we can get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And so they got through into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , I've forgotten which. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Anyway, they finally got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> about 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So the young Adler was then sent to <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> , by that time he'd had a little <span class="BUILDING">Lyceum</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So by 1942 or '43 when he went in the army, he was trilingual, German, French, and English, and he was exactly what I needed, because I had a lot of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> French but I had no German. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It wasn't popular in those days, post World War I, to teach German because of the World War I situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So as Adler and I were traveling around together, he was very much aware of what had been going on and he was very happy to be involved in taking a German general prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But not long after that, in fact, on the 19th and 20th of April, we captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , which was a major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and then we began to find some really grisly things. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">About that same time the unit to our right or south of us had overrun <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I was not involved in the direct liberation or -- you couldn't call it liberation, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">You can call it the capture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But I did go down there because of my military assignment, and there they had a lot of bodies not burned yet, and they were stacked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  How soon after its liberation, for lack of a better word?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Maybe two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I wasn't there at the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  How long did you stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Oh, it was just to visit, to see what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  What did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Well, I saw a lot of bodies and I wasn't sure what they were going to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I don't think they were going to continue burning them because at that point they might have been able to identify some of them, but I have no exact knowledge of what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I do have more knowledge of another one a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So we're talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Could you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and just describe what you did see when you arrived there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Well, we went through the usual surroundings of heavily wired and floodlighted <span class="BUILDING">guard stations</span> and this kind of thing and a lot of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and then the crematortum which we had pictures of. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I don't have pictures of that, but in my history we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And it was obvious that they had burned thousands of bodies there. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">How many thousands, we never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And they still had some left to burn when we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But there were also some still -- some people still survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Did you see the survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  I saw a couple of them who were very emaciated and almost living skeletons, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It wasn't pleasant to look at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Now what we did, of course, the American army would immediately give them medical treatment and suitable clothing and, obviously, food and shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">What happened to them later, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Do you know the numbers in terms of survivors, how many survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  I don't know how many survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  How many did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Oh, I only saw maybe 15 or 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">There were maybe -- have been more but not many.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Where were they physically located?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  They were -- apparently had been put in one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> which, for some special reason, I don't know, but they were probably people who they wanted to use for some particular purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Did you go into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Inspect any of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  No, I did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Did you know of any other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  There was a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> -- it looked like a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters building</span> , but I didn't go in there either. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Actually it was out of my <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">In the army you're supposed to follow certain guidelines, and I went down there more or less just to see what was going on and with no responsibility for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But to get back to the <span class="REGION">Leipzig area</span> , shortly after we got there, we discovered what had been a camp for slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And this was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , more or less an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , northeast of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and, like all of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , it had been run by the deaths head units of the S.S. Totenkopf. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They would march these prisoners out during the day and use them in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and then take them back at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I doubt -- I have no knowledge exactly, but I doubt if there were many Jews in this group, because I think most of the Jews by that time, by late -- 20, 21st of April, had already been disposed of; but there's really no way to tell because there was nobody alive when we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Anyway, they had moved out the bulk of those people and marched them further east away from us -- for what good that did -- because if they marched them very far, they were going into the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But the ones remaining who were apparently not too able, physically ill or maybe disabled, they put in a wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , which apparently -- then they put some kerosene or some kind of flammable on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and started it on fire with thermite grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Then they had the S.S. guards standing around in case anybody got out, which some people did, and they shot them down with the Schmeisser machine pistols. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was completely destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It was still smoldering when I got there and there was nothing but, for the most part, very badly burned-up bodies, various stages of burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">There were several corpses that were entwined in the concertina wire that they had gotten to the point where they were trying to break away and then burned up. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And there were others who had gotten up without burning, and they were shot down in their prison clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We really -- I couldn't believe what I was looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I should have by that time, but it's still hard to believe that humanity will do something like this, particularly people who are disadvantaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">You put in and burn them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">For what reason? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It was obvious the war was virtually over. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">These people weren't going to do any damage to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">It has to take a very twisted mind to authorize and carry out something like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  How large of a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  I would say they were about a hundred feet long and probably about 30 feet wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Was it just one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There were others that were not touched, but they put them all in one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , the one that they burned up, but there were others that were still there with nobody in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Do you have any idea how many bodies were burned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  We estimated at the time about 150, although I have a history book here of our operations which said 300, but I doubt that. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I don't think there were that many. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Now, at that time our units met the Russians at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe River</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torgau</span> , and therefore our eastward movement at that point was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So we were in position for about five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And what to do with this massacre? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So we decided, well, what we're going to do for one thing 1s to go around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> and surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> and if there's anybody who has any significant position left, admitted, we'll take him up there and run him through this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and let them see what happened, which we did, and some of the women fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They couldn't stand it, which I can understand, but they all said, "We had nothing to do with this." </span><span class="sentence" id="232">As we said, you couldn't find a Nazi in a carload. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And then we said okay, the bodies have been decomposing, what was left of them, for about four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We'll have them prepare them for burial. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So we got some of the good Burgers and said okay, we want these bodies prepared for burial and we're going to bury them in the middle of one of your most revered historic areas, which was a monument in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Leipzig</span> to a victory of the German forces during the Napoleonic wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And there was a little ceremony and we had them actually dig the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , individually, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we said, well, maybe we made some kind of impression at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That's what we were trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But we were a military unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We weren't actually supposed to be in that business, but we did what we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Then we got orders to go south, directly south towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , and we put our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grafenwohr</span> , which was a major German training base then and, in fact, was used by the American army all during the cold war later. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was very, very badly destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">The one thing that we found made a lasting impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">During the glory days of Hitler, he would have mass rallies in which they had tens of thousands of people and torches with flames coming up and red banners with a swastika on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And he'd be up there like Fidel Castro, just giving forth his oratory, which he was master of, and everybody was shouting. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">When I saw the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it was empty except we used it for a dump for GI salvage and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> sitting around with some boys, and I thought, well, it's a far cry from what Mr. Hitler was doing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Then this was first couple of days of May of 1945 and we had become part of the Third Army, at that point General Patton's army, otherwise we had been in the First Army for the entire campaign. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So the orders were move into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And so beginning on the fourth -- third or fourth of May, we began crossing the <span class="DLF">line</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and actually used for the first time the 16th Armored Division, which went in and occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> ’. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The Second Infantry Division was involved, the 97th infantry division was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And we found out when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> that the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> were screaming to have us come over there; but unfortunately, as history later showed, we were stopped 18 kilometers east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> because of the deal that was worked out at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yalta</span> to between Churchill and Stalin and Roosevelt -- and you may have seen the pictures of Roosevelt at that meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">He was a very frail man, and it was literally about two months before his death and he may not have been thinking as clearly, but the agreement then was that <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> would be part of -- under Russian control more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So when we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> , we sent a task force over. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">The Russians weren't even to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> by that time and I got there into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And the Czechs were just as enthusiastic about seeing us as the French had been when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But then another unfortunate thing came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We had been in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for maybe two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We had a French liaison officer with us and he had been looking around the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And we had bypassed, as we were moving so fast, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> where there was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> on a small scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And he came in to us and said, "Mon dieu! </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Mon dieu! </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They are burning the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They are burning the bodies." </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">What bodies? </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Who? "</span><span class="sentence" id="269">Oh, down here, so come along." </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So some of us went down there and, sure enough, these German workers with piles of bodies still there were pushing them in and burning them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Well, there was absolutely no way we could identify any of these. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They were beginning to be in an advanced state of decomposition, so we said, well, it's not appropriate to burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">On the other hand, we just can't let them sit there so, actually, they were bulldozed in a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . * </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Also: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> (German).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  How many bodies were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Oh, there must have been a couple hundred and nobody had interfered with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">The people from the 2nd Division to our north had bypassed us and the 16th Armored had bypassed us and they were in kind of an off area so -- the guards had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I mean there wasn't any -- no guards around the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They knew what was going on, but these workers were still dutifully carrying out their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And so this one was one that we actually saw in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Were there any survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We didn't see any survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Now there may have been survivors who -- when the guards took off, also took off because it's quite understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I mean, if you got a chance to get out of there, you got out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  Can you describe the physical characteristics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  It was a similar <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> but a much smaller scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">There was not as many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> that existed there were not as large a scale, and it seemed to us as though this were kind of a last kind of addition to this whole series of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And so in any case, like this, including the one near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Can we just go back Flossenbiirg? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Can you tell us when that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  It would have been on the -- either the third or fourth of May, 1945”, and unfortunately it does not mention it in this book because the -- this book that I'm going to read something from was published very shortly after V-Day in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It says on the cover from '42 to the 9th of May of '45, and I think some of the details of that kind of thing were just not put in here but -- oh, I was going to tell you that once we discovered something like this, the elements of the military police get involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The Judge Advocate General people get involved and they then began to do an official history of what was found, when, where, and all the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I am sure that in the archives of the American Army, there is a complete description of what they found at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Were there any prior briefings as to what to expect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I think the reason for that was that they didn't fully grasp what the potential was. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They might have decided to do something like that, certainly after they came across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , which was about the same time they discovered others further south, but we had no actual ° According to the International Refugee Organization, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> was liberated on 23 April 1945 following a mass evacuation of most of the prisoners to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> three days earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">formal instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">What we did know was, number one, take care of any survivors medically and also see to their welfare; that is, proper food and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, clothing, and then have them interrogated by the representatives of the Criminal Investigation Division of our military police detachments -- CID it was called -- and then also have some JAG people there to see from that point of view what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But this was kind of a do as you find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I don't recall any at that point -- I'm still talking about the battle phase of this -- at that point any formal directives along this <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Now we had formal directives for the recovery of allied military personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">In other words, this was what they called RAMP, acronym, recovery Allied military personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And those directives were pretty clearly in place, and I may be wrong, but I never saw any specific directives for this type of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I think they just didn't anticipate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Any policy for what to do with the bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  We had no directives. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">All we had was what you might call common sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We felt that if we could identify any of them, that's one thing, but no dog tags on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I mean there simply was no way to identify them and you couldn't let them rot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  How did this affect you personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Oh, it was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Let me give you an example of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">After V-E Day we were headquartered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> and we had a major problem with displaced persons, mostly eastern European, but a few from the west, who obviously wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But things were in such turmoil that we just couldn't send them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">We had to do something with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So we put them mainly in the <span class="BUILDING">Kaserns</span> , previous German military installations’, where at night they would have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could feed them and take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But there we had to maintain some kind of discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">You just can't allow people in a very distraught frame of mind to be on their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And we weren't putting in any harsh discipline - that I'll mention in a minute -- but we had to see if they had certain standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And I was visiting one of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> one day, probably about the middle of May 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  And where was this located?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  This was located outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and I was going around inspecting. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">By this time I was a major on the general staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I discovered in one the body of an infant who had just died, apparently, and a rather distraught young mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And I was so kind of hardened to this kind of thing, I really forgot my humanity. "</span><span class="sentence" id="329">You can't have something like this around here. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Get that body out of here." </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I mean there wasn't any kind of spontaneous, "Oh, my goodness, this is such a tragedy and this is such a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We want for you to have a proper funeral." </span><span class="sentence" id="333">At that point I had become, let's say, just kind of a hardened or embittered whatever to this kind of thing, and I thought to myself, well, boy, that -- that * German: <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">wasn't the way to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But when you ask if it had an effect, I think that probably was the result of seeing these unbelievable massacres and deliberate execution of totally innocent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It certainly affects you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Were most of these D.P.s Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Most of them were Hungarians, some Poles, some people probably from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , from other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They were mostly Slovak people who were impressed into serving the Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Another thing that happened in our <span class="REGION">area</span> at that point was the discovery of about 35 young women who were all that was left of -- I think they said something like 1500 women who had been marched by the Germans away from the advancing Russians for maybe six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And they had marched them in columns and fed them practically nothing, and when they would keel over, they would just shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And we didn't discover this for several days after V-E Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But we did find this small group of survivors, none of whom were more than 25, but they all looked like about 85, and they were emaciated, they were in terrible shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And they told us a story and that led to a full-blown investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Do you remember where they came from originally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  They came, apparently, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> originally and they may have been Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I kind of doubt it because why would they march them that-- they'd probably just send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz--</span> but at least they were about as badly treated as you can get. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So another example of man's inhumanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  And they were discovered where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  In the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> , not far from where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They were out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> somewhere, hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  So at that point, there were no longer guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The word got around pretty fast that showing up in a German uniform wasn't a good idea unless you were getting away from the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">That's another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">About, oh, the day after V-E Day, my driver Adler and I were sent on a mission beyond our <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I don't remember why, but we were by ourselves in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> on a <span class="DLF">rural road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We were on a bend in the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we discovered a whole German battalion, which kind of surprised us. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They had stacked arms, which I was pleased to see, and they came rushing out and said, "Kamerad, Kamerad!" </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I didn't understand what the guy was saying, but the German officer was telling us they wanted to surrender, surrender the sooner the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So Adler was getting a huge charge out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Here was this little Jewish boy taking a part in a surrender of a whole German battalion. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So I said, "All nght. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">We'll be back." </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So we drove on down and accomplished our mission, whatever it was, I've forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I think it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway car</span> we had discovered they thought had certain documents in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Anyway, on the way back the officer said, "So what are you going to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I said, "Just take it easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We will send people back here." </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So we got back to the <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We said, "Hey, send a detail out there and march those guys in." </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But, boy, they didn't want to surrender to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They wanted to get back to <span class="DLF">American lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And that happened in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">This was just one example. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Having battled the Germans from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , when I went around that corner and saw a whole battalion, 1t shook me up a little bit, momentarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Now you indicated that you wanted to read something from the Corps History. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Would you want to show the book so we can see the cover?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Now, this a printed description of the incident I've told you about near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> (reads): "At the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thekla</span> northeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , our troops overran another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">political prison camp</span> which still showed evidence of a horrible massacre on the previous day. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">With rescue by the Americans only a few hours away, inmates were herded into one long wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> by their brutal S.S. guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">After locking the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and covering the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , the guards then threw incendiary grenades upon the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">In a moment the whole structure was a roaring inferno filled with screaming human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">A few broke out into the open, only to be met by a hail of rifle fire which cut them down, their clothing still burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The smaller number that escaped had cleared their way through thick rolls of barbed wire, tearing their burning flesh in a miraculous dash to safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The rest were shot down and their naked charred bodies were still there when our troops arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So here on the outskirts of one of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's greatest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , world famous for its beautiful <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , its culture, its monuments to great men," <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , that is, there stood a monument to a new type of German culture that the world should never forget.” </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And this was written in June of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And so this tells you how we felt about this kind of thing that we had uncovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I think it's significant that it's in that book. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Primarily that book is telling about the military operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Of course, we didn't run across too much of this, but it was incidental to the principle purpose, which is to record how this -- how the whole battle went, who was involved, where, when, and where.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  I heard you have two artifacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Would you like to explain to us what they are and how you came about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Well, this one is a ceremonial dagger. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">There were a number of different Nazi organizations, some military, some paramilitary, and they all had their own --
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Could you jut turn it a little bit, face up? </span><span class="sentence" id="402">> United States War Crimes Investigating Team 6822 reported that <span class="BUILDING">Barrack</span> No. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">5 of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thekla labor camp</span> , a subcommando of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , was set afire on 18 April 1945 by guards and that 90 prisoners died either in the fire or were shot in the attempt of escape. (</span><span class="sentence" id="404">Source: International Tracing Service of the International Refugee Organization.)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  They all had their own -- their own handy dandy daggers which could, of course, be used effectively. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">This shows you what it would be like to be stuck with one of these and, of course, that's a swastika here, and also up here, as a matter of fact, the name of the person who owned it on the back and his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">This was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuwied</span> where I got this, just on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> , on the east bank of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So you could use something like this to obviously kill somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Then after the person was dead, there's another type of ceremonial weapon -- you could hardly call this a dagger -- with which you could chop up the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">This is basically a saw for cutting through bone. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So you take your bayonet type and slice up the flesh after killing the person, and then you come along if you want to, let's say, cut off the head with the bone structure of the neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">You've got the serrated portions here to act like a saw, and the German insignia up on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I got several other of this type of thing which I still have, but I brought two of them along today just to give you an idea of the kind of thing we discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Were these carried by officers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  No, not necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">This could have been carried by NCOs as well as officers and I'm not certain if this one was actually an S.S. type. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It looks like it but I'm not a hundred percent sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I know there are now books where you can find -- which you can totally identify these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I have another one which is silver with a pearl handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  Let's take a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  General, if you could explain the picture that we have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">That picture shows what is left and what we found of the remains of the people in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that I talked about being deliberately burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">These remains, the corpses, you can see were huddled together, and died together and there's nothing left of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> except the ashes of these burned up bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Now some of them --
QUESTION:  Can you again tell us the geographic location?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">This happened in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thekla</span> , which I would guess was probably 12 or 14 kilometers northeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And these people who were largely eastern Europeans, had been treated as slave labor by the Nazis and were working in, for one thing, an <span class="BUILDING">aircraft parts factory</span> , and there may have been a couple of other <span class="NPIP">places</span> they worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They would take them out during the day and bring them back to these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">As I said, when we approached, they marched out, some of them could still maneuver pretty well. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">The rest of them they loaded in this <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and burned to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Where these bodies are huddled, that's the center of what would have been the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It's approximately the center of what would have been the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">The outline of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> 1s still there, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  And what is depicted in the background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  The background shows another <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> similar to the one that was burned up. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They didn't choose to burn all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They just burned the one in which they had all these people en masse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  And this is an original photograph?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  These pictures were taken within 48 hours after the event, maybe less than that, and by a Signal Corps photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Contrary to army regulations, he gave me a copy of them which I have kept every since because, as I mentioned earlier, I couldn't believe what I was looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I thought, well, here it 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to tell us about that particular photograph?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  Not especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It just shows that when people are in a desperate situation, they'll either fight or flee, and some of them were deciding to try to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They got together and they were just burned up en masse. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Others decided to flee and were able to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , a few without being burned, who were then machine gunned down, and others who were obviously on fire when they got out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And we'll see in just a moment, if you'll take a look at the next picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Would you describe the next picture for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">This shows about four, five, or six badly burned corpses which were outside the perimeter of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and who -- obviously their clothing was on fire and they were burned to death outside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> trying to get out, and desperate to get to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and trying to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Do you have any recollection of how far the bodies were from the actual <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  Well, those bodies would be perhaps 20 to 30 feet, not very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">If you're burning from head to foot, you're not going to move too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It's a very grisly thing to look at and very, very hard to comprehend what people will do to other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Did you determine whether these people had been shot, in addition?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  No, they had not been shot, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They hadn't been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">There wasn't any point in shooting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I imagine that by the time they hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , they were either dead or close to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  This also was taken by the same photographer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">All these pictures were taken by the same photographer at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I might have mentioned the nonfraternization policy that the Army had, with good reason it turned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We were not supposed to have any relations with German civilians except very perfunctory ones, such as where 1s the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> and where 1s the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and that kind of thing but since -- at the time this policy was prepared, they weren't aware of how bad the situation was, but they didn't want the GIs cozying up to the Germans at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And a number of our troops who were of German descent were pretty embarrassed about the whole deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It didn't make them proud to have been of German descent. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And then you think about the -- as this book says, the great accomplishments of the Germans tn the arts and music and science and even theology, Martin Luther. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And you come down to something like that and you wonder how it can happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  (Inaudible.)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Provisional. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">By that time we had no further use for anti-aircraft battalions, so they set up a provisional organization called security guards, and the letters on the helmet indicate that. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">These were -- they had nearly enough military police or regular organization to go around to handle everything we had run across, so they conferred these A.A. battalions primarily to security police and had their helmets painted accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  Would you describe this photograph here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">This shows more of the victims who, in their desperation to flee to safety, even though on fire, got as far as the <span class="DLF">concertina wire</span> that is formed around the <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> but then collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">You can see that their bodies continued to burn at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">There were others who actually got into the <span class="DLF">wire</span> and twisted up in the <span class="DLF">wire</span> , and then were a few others who managed to get there without being on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We have a couple of pictures showing that there were some who got out with their clothes but they, again, were machine-gunned by the Totenkopf unit of the S.S.
QUESTION:  There's one more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  This picture shows the perimeter of the <span class="REGION">area</span> and the type of <span class="DLF">wire enclosure</span> they had and also the floodlights so that they could illuminate it by night, and what you see up in the distance is a <span class="BUILDING">guard station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And the <span class="REGION">area</span> was divided into a couple sections and you can see that this was a <span class="DLF">path</span> through two of the <span class="REGION">sections</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> aren't visible here because -- I think one of them is possibly visible on the right but that's off to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But it shows you the type of <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> that they kept these people in, not nearly as elaborate as they would have around some of the bigger places like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , but then on a smaller scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And they weren't organized for the same purpose, but the results were the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  After leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> , where did you go from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  We went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> and then I think I mentioned 18 kilometers east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> , we were stopped and we were there until the 18th of June, 1945 when they pulled us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They said you're the people with amphibious attack experience, so we're going to take you out here and send you back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And after you have a month of R & R, so called, we will get you aboard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and send you to the Pacific, because we're going to be needing your assistance in the invasion of the main island of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Honshu</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And this was scheduled for October of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Still you'll have enough time to see your friends when you get back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and then we'll ship you out to the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> , and from there we will ship you to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And from the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> then, you will be used probably in a secondary landing after the principle one. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So we thought, well, we're not looking forward to assaulting <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , but we are looking forward to getting back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LeHavre</span> on the fifth of July, 1945 on board a very fast <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liner</span> that had been the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">USS America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">The army called it the <span class="DLF">West Point</span> during World War II and crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> in about six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and we were among the early troops back so they had a big celebration for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessels</span> out in New York Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire boats</span> shooting off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and they had people with jazz bands playing and whatever, whistles blowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We thought that was nice, but it was even nicer to see the Statue of Liberty and be back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And from there we were, as I say, given 30 days off. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And at the end of the 30 days, the bomb went off in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and that precluded our use in the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , which suited us just fine, because if, 1n fact, Truman had not made that decision, it would have been anybody's guess, probably half a million casualties, both American and Japanese, and there had been enough death and dying already without that. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So they let the genie out of the bottle as far as nuclear weapons are concered, but since they haven't been used since, it probably was a good idea in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">It saved a lot of lives at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  How long did you remain in the service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Well, in October of 1945 they said to me, "Now, Roberts, would you like to stay on active duty?" </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And I thought, well, the Army's going to be dullsville. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Europe 1s flat on its back, so is <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is preeminent total world power. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Who's going to start a war? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I don't want to do close-order drill. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So thanks a lot, but I'll go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But I did say I would like to have a commission as a major in the reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So that was forthcoming. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I did go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I got into the advertising and public relations field. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">At the same time in the late 40s, they started to organize the reserve and I became increasingly active in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And as a matter of fact, when <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out, I was on active duty; but for reasons that the army later regretted, they didn't make use of organized reserve components very much then. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They did to some extent, but if they had used more, it might have turned out a little differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Anyway, for the next 20 years virtually I was increasingly active 1n the reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Army War College</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carlisle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I went to the Command General Staff College at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Leavenworth</span> , and by 1967 the Army then put me in charge of all the Army reserves in <span class="REGION">eastern Ohio</span> , <span class="REGION">West Virgina</span> , and <span class="REGION">western Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Then in 1970 they asked me to come back on full duty in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> , initially as a Deputy Chief of the Army Reserve on the army general staff, and then as Chief of the Army Reserve from 1971 to 1975. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So I had an unusual career in that I had four years early on of full duty, and five years virtually of full duty at the end, and reserve duty in between with many periods of active service and schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I was promoted to major general as I assumed Chief of the Army Reserve at the beginning of May, rather, in May of 1971, and so I'm now a major general of the United States Army, retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I'm wearing an insignia today of the Distinguished Service Medal, which we used to call the general's good conduct medal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  Have you previously discussed your experiences in Europe and what you saw with other groups or people or with the service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  Not specifically in this type of <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I did do an audio oral history for the <span class="BUILDING">Army War College</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carlisle</span> , which took me through, of course, my experiences in World War II and my early experience and subsequent, but there was no concentration on this type of atrocity thing, although it was mentioned but not as much as we have done today. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">There have been some references to that history. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">A chap published a book recently in which he attributed some of his comments to my oral history. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So since I left the active army for nine years, I became executive director of the Reserve Officer's Association, which is a major military lobby on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capitol Hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Since then, I have been working with General Daniel Graham and the Strategic Defense Initiative program, which seems to be going along in good shape now, despite many of our critics who wish we would go away, but we haven't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Are there any concluding remarks you wish to make?</span></p>
