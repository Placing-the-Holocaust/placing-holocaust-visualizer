<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Uh Bea, we've started. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Would you tell us your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I'm uh Beatrice Pappenheimer, but I was born Beate Stern.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> uh is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was uh October 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents and your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My family consisted of my parents and I have a sister who is three years younger than I am, and at that time we had an uncle living with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He was uh about nineteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was still going to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and also uh my grandmother lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And this is, this was our family unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Tell me about your childhood, before it became really bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> it was still mostly peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Uh the only thing that I remember was that my uncle used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and he used to have uh many arguments going on with my father, because my uncle would say, I can see the hand- writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I see what's coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Let's get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father, he was an orthodox Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He had a lot of faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He had faith in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He had faith in people, and he thought, well, Hitler then...Hitler as much as what he's doing and what we're hearing, he's not going to get away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And also probably he thought what am I going to do in a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , even <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, where things were pretty tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He didn't speak any language but German. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He was in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He had a <span class="BUILDING">textile business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We owned a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> but he was on the <span class="DLF">road</span> most of the time and my mother was in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh as a matter of fact, I remember this because my grandmother used to take care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I, I think in those days I used to know my grandmother better than I knew my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">As a matter of fact, I often think of my parents being very modern, today's parents like, because they both worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father had had a university education and I was taken care of by the grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And uh then the other thing that I remember was that uh there was talk about a cousin dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I remember I had nightmares about that for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">That was the first time I knew what it was like to be scared of death, of something unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Uh that was my earliest recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I also...I remember playing dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Uh I would lay down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room floor</span> and I would cross my hands over my chest and say to Grandma, I'm dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So there was talk about people, I remember, even disappearing and dying, even that early. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The next thing that I remember - one day my parents came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they were all agitated and uh the reason for it was they had to go and register somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And I remember something about that the men were called <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ...they had a name and the women's name was Sara.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But my parents were terribly upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They didn't like the idea that they had to give their names and addresses and occupation and I think also what it was they had to have permission to uh move. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">If they want to move out if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> , they had to get permission, and that upset them to no end, and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> until about 1936 when my father had to give up his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and they also had to give up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because Jews were not allowed to have any, hold any property anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">One of the reasons we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was because my uh father had a brother and his family was living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And that...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was a__ big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , compared to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> , but we had had a nice sized <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> it was a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">When we first came there we moved into with my uh aunt and uncle and their three children, and they just had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so I remember us being five children in one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we had a wonderful time as children but at the same time it was bedlam. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my uh...I remember my father and my uncle both trying to find us an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Well, that was very very difficult already in those days because many people wouldn't, if you were a Jew they wouldn't rent you an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They weren't allowed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But finally my father found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and I think...well, this 1s the picture that I showed you that I have a picture from. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And uh it was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> compared to the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> which consisted of three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and we shared it with other families but we had a a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened from the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , so that was the main <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and on the left side was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and on the right hand side was was the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> I was old enough I had to start going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very very different than what we have here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">There were all man teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They were uh going by the uh Nazi theories and we had to learn how to say "Heil Hitler" and we had to uh we were taught Nazi theories. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I don't remember much of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I just remember mostly uh that they taught us a tremendous amount in one year, but they were extremely strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was perfectly alright for the teacher to hit you, and uh for the girls, I remember we had to go up to the front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> of the teacher, and it was always on a <span class="DLF">platform</span> , and we would hold our hands out like so, the tips of our fingers, and he would take the ruler and hit our hands that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">For the boys, he could slap them around wherever the hand would fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We had to sit a certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We had to write a certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We could not look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and God forbid we should talk to each...to each other, or to the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">You were only allowed to talk if the teacher addressed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So it was completely different, but naturally I didn't realize that until years and years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Also we didn't like to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , mostly because on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there were other children, not Jewish, who would go after us and yell, dirty Jews, or Christ killer...all kinds of names. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They would push us, throw stones at us and we were very afraid and the same thing when we would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Sometimes we would duck into <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I remember one of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> we used to run into was uh a big <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> , and it had uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span> and that was my first experience with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh, yes, the city of * decree August 17, 1938 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was quite modern, and it was a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I still remember the <span class="DLF">parks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I still remember the <span class="BUILDING">Schloss</span> , or the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> that we used to go to that was in the <span class="DLF">park</span> and every Sabbath afternoon we would uh just walk around this since we were orthodox, so one of the things you did, in the morning you would go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , in the afternoon you would go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And talking about <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , we didn't really have a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We used to have one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I remember my father and I going to a regular <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> for some reason I never went to a regular <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We went where there was just like an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and it was two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> - one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the women and one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the men, and there always had to be a guard in front of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> uh watching the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so I don't know whether it was you were not allowed to hold services or not, but I just remember the guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But as children we used to have a good time running around and uh my parents being religious we used to go every Friday and...my father used to go Friday I should say. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We used to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , wait for him to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the on Saturday mornings we used to all go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and it was a religious thing, but I think it was also social because we had a chance to meet with other people then. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Uh we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there for about a year, and then Hitler closed all the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to Jewish children.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We were not allowed to attend the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And after that my father tried to teach us as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Uh I remember as we used to uh sometimes go for a walk with one of my parents or with both of them, we used to see signs in front of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> saying Juden verboten. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Not only uh <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> but also <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> and even <span class="DLF">parks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And our lives became more and more restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Uh one day as children we were playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> because that was the only place where we could play, and two Nazis came along and we picked up some little pebbles out of the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> and started throwing those pebbles at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">By then we had a hatred for the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Well, they got tired of the game, and they turned around and they started yelling at us and going after us, and it was just fortunate that we knew the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and the <span class="DLF">alleys</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> a little better than they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But my mother, she had been watching from the <span class="DLF">living room window</span> and she saw the whole episode and when we came back upstairs she was absolutely furious, and she says, I can't trust you to play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> by yourselves anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">From now on, either you have to have your father or I along, so that restricted our movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh we used to see parades. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We lived uh where there was right opposite from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , there was like a uh <span class="DLF">public square</span> and there was a tall uh column, you might say, and I don't know uh what it was all about uh but they used to have parades, uh the brown shirts and some of the other Nazi movements, and I as a child, I loved uh listening to the music. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I used to love to listen to the parade and the marching, never thinking anything that much of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I knew my parents were against it, but it sounded so pretty, so I would go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and look out. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And one day my mother came up behind me and she hit me on my behind and she said I don't want you looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So I couldn't do that anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Uh like I say, our lives were very very restricted, plus scary at the same time because I remember my mother saying to my father, now be sure you're back by nig...uh night time. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I don't want to have to worry * Jewish children could only go to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> : Nov., 1938; no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for Jewish children at all: July 1, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And one of the reasons was that uh there were a lot of muggings going on and people just disappearing, so my mother always used to say, be...be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before it's dark, and I remember there were times when my father wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she would pace the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span> , back and forth, back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So life for my parents must have been terribly tough, terribly uncertain and I, I remember the arguments between them a lot uh for one reason or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Also because uh some of the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> were closed to us it was hard even to know where to get your bread, where to get your food. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It was tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I had one experience that I shall never forget was that one day uh I went over to see my girlfriend, and she lived right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us, and I go upstairs...she lived also in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ...and uh I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The mother opens up the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she's, and she says to me, oh it's you. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I don't want you playing anymore here. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And she just shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And that was the last I saw of this friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And I gather that she wasn't Jewish, and by then, and I forgot exactly what year it was...could have been probably 1937, '38...they couldn't, they they could not fraternize with you any more, but that hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I still carry that hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Uh the next thing that I can tell you about is that uh one night we woke up and there was a lot of commotion in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and as I remembered looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , I saw fires all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was as though the whole city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was burning, but I remember saying something...my father was saying uh the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> are burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They're burning all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So he quickly got dressed and went downstairs and I remember my mother and my sister and I waiting up for my father to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And we waited and we waited all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We found out...and I don't remember when I found this out, but now I can tell you that he had been taken like a lot of other men that night, rounded up and they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I don't remember how long he was gone, but I shall never forget the day he came back, and at first I didn't know it was him, because the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> opens up and there stands this man...he was bent over. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">My father had...he was a short man but he had always been quite erect, but that day he was bent over and he had, he was all dirty and there was blood on him and he was shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We had one of those old-fashioned uh black wood-burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> right across from the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> , and when he opened up that <span class="DLF">door</span> he started putting his hands, both hands, on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , and I knew it was hot, so I screamed at him...Pa...and at that same instant, I recognized who he was, and I screamed, Papa, Papa, it's hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And my screams brought my mother into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she took one look at him and I still remember her raising her hands and quickly going to him and taking him into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Well my father was sick, I guess, and uh it was lucky I think that my mother had a little bit of nursing experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Somehow she managed to get him well, because we couldn't call a doctor by then, and uh...but he was never the same after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I don't think my father found work when we had come to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I don't know really what he did, except for one comment. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">One evening...I I I used to watch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">His hands always hurt him, and one evening I remember we were sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I said to him, how come your hands hurt you so much Father? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And he said it's because I'm laying bricks and it's hard work and it hurts my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So he must have been maybe put into forced labor and uh he was a brick-layer. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He was never the same after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He stayed around the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> quite a bit and maybe he was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I don't know to this day how he managed to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Uh I don't know...some people I know if they paid enough money they were able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Others they escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I don't know how he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The next thing that I remember is uh that we had bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The air raids started. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The air raids would start up and we'd go down...first of all we had to pull our shades because we had, there was blackout, so we had to go down...we pulled the shades, went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and there we huddled in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , because we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> , several of them must have been connected so it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">community basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And one of the things that I remember and probably this whole episode I remember because of that...my mother used to tell stories to everyone and one of her stories...I I smile at it today, and whether I believed her or not I don't know, but she would say...see this <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It has a rounded <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It had a rounded <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we were all huddled down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Some of the children were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Some of the older people wringing their hands and saying what's going to become of us, and uh you didn't know whether you would live from one minute to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">You would hear the bombs falling and it was...it was terribly frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And here my mother tells the story...see this <span class="DLF">roof</span> is rounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">If a bomb should fall, it's not going to come through. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It's going to roll right off, and I must have laughed at it even at this time, because when ever I think about it, it makes me laugh for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And she would tell all kinds of different stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">She would try to get everybody to sing songs, just anything just to take their minds off just a little bit of of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Then the air raid sirens would blow again and we'd go upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So we got used to that kind of a life uh...nights being interrupted by the sirens. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Sometimes even during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Then one day...it was late 1939,° there was a loud knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And there stood two Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My mother asked them, what do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And they said, don't ask any questions, and they yelled, just go and pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And my mother said, well, how long are we going to be gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">How much should we pack? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And they got angrier and angrier as she asked these questions, and they yelled louder and louder, and finally they said, just go pack enough for two weeks, so my mother goes into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and she starts packing and I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> because I had a doll that I loved very much and I used to take that doll where ever I went, so as I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> one of the Nazis followed me, and I go and pick up that doll and he says, he says to me, and he also gets ahold of my arm and starts shaking me and saying, where you're going you don't need this doll, and I look at him, and to this day I can see that face. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I and I said to him, if I can't have that doll...I thought for some reason that he wanted it... said to him, if I can't have that doll, you can't have her either. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I take the doll and I threw her down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and her doll...and that doll was made...her face was made out of porcelain and broke into hundreds of pieces, and oh, that it got me so upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">As a matter of fact I was so upset during that whole episode I don't remember my father or my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It seemed like the whole thing was played out between my mother and I for some reason, and yet I know they were there, but I don't remember them at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My mother gets done packing and we're about to go out, and I look around that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I thought to myself...we'll never see it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And I look at my mother and I said to her as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I * date uncertain says I don't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They're not going to let us see this <span class="NPIP">place</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And I take ahold of the leg of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen table</span> and I...I wouldn't let go of it, and my mother had a terrible time trying to get me out of the <span class="DLF">door</span> , but little by little she calmed me and she managed to get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and there there were hundreds of people, lots of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And you could tell some of them had been waiting there for quite some time, because they were laying on blankets, sitting on the suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">There were babies crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Older people again crying and uh it was just so confusing...everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We waited, I I forgot for how long, but after a while we lined up and they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Now it was a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but we were squeezed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">There were so many of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I thought always because there was so many people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I don't know whether they'd slow (ph) or not that that's why the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went very slow. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It went very slow, and especially going around a bend. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It would really slow down, and because there were So many people, it was very hot and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open so some people thought they would escape and they jumped out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , but they didn't realize at first that there were Nazis on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and they had guns and they shot those people as they tried to get away from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and that was my first experience seeing someone die. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I saw some being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And people were just...everybody was very excited on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Then after a while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and it was at the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And then there was a voice over the loudspeaker and it said, if you have any money, get rid of it, or at least I thought that's what it said, because my mother, she tried to hide some money on her and and I I was in a terrible state I guess because I saw her doing it and I started screaming at her, which I would never have dared to do under ordin...ordinary circumstances because you had a great great respect for your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But I said to her, don't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They're going to do something terrible to you, and sure enough, they had said over the loudspeaker that if you disobeyed orders, you would be shot, and so I was just hysterical when I saw her doing that and so she says OK, take the money and flush it down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So I go take the money and I go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and I flush it down, and I don't think...I don't know how much it was or anything...it was just a handful...and then I came back and I walked through the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> because there they have <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> and I walked through the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> and you can see into the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> and there I saw the Nazis searching people and taking them out into the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> and uh after a while I noticed that they were lining them up on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Pretty soon I hear the shots and true to their word they were shooting all the people who had tried to hide money on their person. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But I didn't see...I just heard the shots...I didn't see anything because my mother took me against her body like and she hid my face against her. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on, and like I said, there were so many people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">My mother had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> but I didn't, and after a while I made myself comfortable on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I just sat down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I remember I had a <span class="DLF">wall</span> to lean against. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I remember still seeing a fat lady sitting there and there was an old man and people standing...somebody tall and thin and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I don't remember...there was no food, nothing to drink, and I missed more not having anything to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I became very very thirsty and my throat felt so dry, almost was like getting a sore throat, and I don't remember how many days we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It just seemed like 1t went on and on and on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I slept some and then suddenly the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and we were able to get out but then they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and I remember still the roughness of those of those Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Sometimes there was an old person who didn't walk fast enough for them, and they would kick him, or they would pull a man's beard or they would hit them with their sticks that they had and always I heard the word, "schnell, schnell", which means quick, quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Then we were put on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">My first sight of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> what...my my...I became just desolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">There was barbed wire all around it and it looked all brown, grey and black. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">There wasn't any green for grass. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">There were no leaves on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It looked so desolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It looked so sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and then we were separated, the men from the women and we had to say goodbye to my father and the women were taken to a big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and there they told us to get undressed and this time they looked for gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We had little bracelets. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They took those. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">My mother, she had pierced earrings. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They were round...they were hoop earrings and they pulled those earrings right off her ear lobe. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They didn't even give her a chance to take them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They just pulled them, and I still her, hear her cry out to this day, and I remember her holding her hands like that to her ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Then they gave us <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> was very light, and I was surprised but the reason why it was so light was because it just contained straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They assigned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Now my mother and sister and I, we had only one bed to sleep on. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We were about twenty-five to thirty people in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We had just...there were just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> but they had like...they were they were frames, wooden frames, chicken wire and then we put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> on. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">People tried to have a little privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Now I remember them, them hanging up maybe some kind of a rag or cloth, and in each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> there was a scale, and I was, really at first | remember I was wondering what was the scale for. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But I had a chance to find out, because everyday they would throw one loaf of bread into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and they would throw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The women would go after that loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">At first it wasn't that bad, but then when you...but then when we became hungrier and hungrier, things became worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And the reason I'm saying this is that we used to have one person to div...to divide up this loaf of bread, and it wasn't very big. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It was regular loaf like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But to divide it up amongst, like I say, twenty-five to thirty people wasn't very easy, and also I never saw any knives, forks or spoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So one person was selected and she would try and weigh bread as closely as possible so everybody would have the same amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Didn't always work out that way because it was very difficult to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So 1f one person would get just a little bit more, the other women would jump on this person and they would have terrible fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">These women who had been ladies turned like into animals almost, just to have a little bit of more bread, but they were starving us, and when you are that hungry it hurts and you will do almost anything, anything to get just a little bit of bread, or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The other thing that they used to give us in the evenings, they used to give us a bowl of soup and the soup consisted of just...1t was liquid and it had a little bit of a vegetable in it but one day in my soup I found a little piece of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">A little piece of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I still see it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And I ate that piece of meat and do you know that I can still taste it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I still know what it looks like and do you...nothing in my whole life is every going to taste as good as that little piece of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">How it found it's way to me I don't know, but that's the only time that I had meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">That's about all that I can remember getting or eating there except my mother worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , so I had dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">People got terribly sick with various diseases because the sanitary conditions were non- existent. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Like I never saw any running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that we were staying in, it leaked. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So sometimes my mother, she would have a container and she would try and collect as much water as possible and I think we used that for drinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We used it for various things that we needed, maybe washing off a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I don't remember taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , bath, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We had lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We had lice in our hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We had lice on our clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I remember my sister, she had terrible sores because these lice, they made you scratch, and she had sores all over her legs, all over her arms and body, and in the evening my mother would try and take her clothes off but the clothes would stick to the sores and she would cry terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">The one strange thing that happened in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was that we used to get uh people from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">A woman would come...I mean it was a lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">She would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">She was from the uh Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">She would come and as children we'd go to this one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where we used to be able to uh play certain games and she would be there and she would sing songs for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I remember this because she used to yodel. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">That's the first time I heard any yodeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And she would distribute those little triangles of cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">One piece of cheese per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Well, it would have been better if she hadn't done it at all because what happened was we were like animals and some of us were stronger than other people and because we were so hungry, terrible fights used to break out again amongst us children. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We used to try and get away the cheese from each other, and I...as a matter of fact my sister to this day holds it against me...being older, being stronger than her, I used to grab the cheese away from her, and she oft...she often...that's one of the things she always used to say to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">She says, Bea, how could you have done this to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I was starving like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">How could you take the cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I took the cheese away from her and so I don't understand...I never could understand how how how come they did something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They knew we were terribly hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And yet they came and they went back, and they didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They they saw the way we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And...but that didn't happen too often. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I remember maybe two, three times during that time...I was there almost a year...
QUESTION:  Which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was this, Bea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  This, this was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And uh it was, it was a terrible thing to do to us and it didn't help us any. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">By then I, we had been there maybe a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I was very homesick for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Uh and I would, I would listen to grown-up's conversation, and I knew where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man's camp</span> was, and maybe because I listened uh I got it into my head that I want to visit my father, no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I, I...the urge was so strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I had to see my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So I told my sister about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I said I want to see our father, and she says you are absolutely crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">First of all, they're not going to let you. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They'll shoot us before they'll let you do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I said I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I want to see our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Will you come with me? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Very reluctantly my sister comes with me and I take her hand and we go to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The guard comes out of his <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> and he must have asked where were, where we want to go and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He must have given me a certain amount of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I don't remember the exact conversation, but one thing I remember is that I didn't have any respect for our guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I wasn't even that scared of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I just had no respect for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I felt I was superior to them, and I don't know why, where that feeling even came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And because of that I think I was able to do what I did, because there we were having a bit of an argument and like I say, I don't remember the exact conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The one thing that I remember about it is that I kicked him on his boot and I said to him, "tu sale cochon", which means you dirty pig. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I take my sister's hand and we...I said to her, what ever you do Suzie, don't look back, and we march out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we, I thought for sure he would shoot us in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I really expected it, but he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We marched and we marched and to this day I still can see that <span class="DLF">route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was very close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">You could see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> , and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> were throwing a shadow over the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and after the shadow I still can see that sun shining and we walked down that <span class="DLF">road</span> and I find the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where the men are, and somebody must have...yeah, somebody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Somebody took us to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I don't remember everything about that visit, but one thing I've never forgotten...just during that time they were giving everyone eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Just an egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And I was so surprised to see an egg, because we had never gotten an egg at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was very hard to get eggs and I've always loved eggs, so if they were giving each man an egg, I thought ummm....my father surely will share that egg with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I know he will. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My father opens up the egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So did the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It was a raw egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I look at my father, and he was shaking for some reason as he was looking at the egg, so I go look at the egg and low and behold there's blood in the egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Well an orthodox Jew will not eat an egg with blood in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It's unclean. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It's not kosher, but I thought oh, he'll make an exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He'll, he'll eat some of it and give us some surely. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">We're starving after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But my father takes the egg and throws it against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I could hardly believe it, but I look at that yellow ooze running down the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and I thought to myself, I'm going to go lick it before 1t touches the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and I go and run for it, but I made the mistake of turning around as I ran, because I, I knew I was...I...I...what I was doing was not right, and I looked at my father's face and I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I could not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">My father took us in his arms and we cried together. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I don't...that's something I just could never forget, that even though he was starving, we were starving, he would not eat the egg that had blood in it and therefore not kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Uh we got back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> and that's, that was, that's the big thing that I remember about that visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Then uh my sister who like I say is four years younger than I, she became very weak, very sickly, so one day my mother said it's...I'm going to send Suzie out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> so you have to say goodbye to her, and I said goodbye to my sister and I hated it because she was really my best friend and so it was just my mother and I and shortly after that they transferred us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> ...
QUESTION:  Do you know...excuse me...do you know where Suzie went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  At that time I did not know where she went. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I just knew she...I said goodbye to her and that was it, so then, like I say, we were transferred to the, to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by the name of Rivesaltes and there it was much the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The only thing is I must have even gotten hungrier because I remember going into the garbage, so I was in competition with the rats and the mice. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">As a matter of fact there was talk about the rats being also starving, not having enough food so they used to bite people. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I became sick with cholera and uh they put me into like an <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I remember there was a <span class="DLF">window</span> with bars on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">One day I see my father's face and I could hardly believe it and I, I must have asked how come they let him come to see me, and he said it's because I'm being transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Well, I didn't think too much of it for some reason uh and I didn't realize that that was the last time that I saw my father, through that <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I got better and then one day my mother came for me, and as we walked back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> I still remember her saying to me, you know it's time that I sent you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Otherwise you won't last much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Now my mother, I remember watching her in the evenings when she would get undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">She was like a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And also she started coughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">She would cough at night and now I suspect she came down with TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But I remember the coughing and I remember how skinny she was and also probably she gave us maybe some of the food that she should have eaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">One day my mother takes me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there were other children and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and then we were loaded up on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I said goodbye to my mother, also not really realizing this would be the last time I would ever see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We said goodbye and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It was broad daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">There was this organization called the OSE, Oeuvre de Secours des Enfants and they took out as many children as they could out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and they had <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> across the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I was moved fourteen different times and uh these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ...they were like <span class="BUILDING">chateaus</span> or big <span class="BUILDING">mansions</span> and we used to be maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty, two hundred children in one of those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They were, they tried to teach us French and also uh give us...they gave us French uh names like I was born Beate and my name name turned into Beatrice. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Uh they gave us...we didn't have much schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We were really busy trying to, for instance we...to grow vegetables so we would have something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Sometimes we came to these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">They didn't even have enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> so the boys would be uh building <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Us girls, we would till the soil so we would have something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They use...they used to teach us how to survive in the, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Uh what grasses, what weeds to eat because many times we didn't have enough vegetables, so we would eat off the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Uh we just...we were constantly moving all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We did our own cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We did our own uh washing of dishes and uh did everything ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I really learned housekeeping in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Uh we we learned how to write a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They always made sure that we would write to our parents in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We had older children looking after the younger ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Uh I received letters from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">As a matter of fact I tried to send a package once to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Uh I I hadn't...I... some reason bread became very very important to me and so one day I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I tried to get...I got some bread and I made a package to send to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Whether my mother ever got it or not I have no idea and those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were raided though. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And so they used to move us. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I remember one night they woke us up and we were moved by uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It was a terrible ride yet at the same time I found it very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">At other times we were moved by like farmer's cart with hay on top of us, because the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was also occupied and all these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were occupied and and a lot of the uh French were Na...Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So we were moved from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">One day as I came to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a little girl comes and she brings me a blanket and I look at her, she looks at me, and I thought oh, she looks familiar, and I didn't recognize her right away because she didn't have any hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Her hair was shaved and she had a bandage, and it took me maybe a couple of seconds to recognize my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I could hardly believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was pure coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">It was like a miracle that we found each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Well we, needless to say, we were overjoyed and we hugged each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">As a matter of fact we would...we wouldn't let go of each other for the longest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We were quite insecure. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I remember being terribly insecure and I used to scratch my he...my head all the time and uh I used to think, what's going to happen to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">What's going to happen to us when the war is over with? </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Will my parents be alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Will we find them again? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Will we find each other again? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But I also learned something during those days, that maybe because the times were so terrible that I learned that what goes on around you is one thing and what goes on within you can be another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Because I found myself having perfectly happy moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And it was a strange revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Tell us about some of those moments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  I remember once we were, we were in this uh <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and and these moments came all of a sudden, for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I was going down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and I was going to be with some other girls and on those <span class="DLF">stairs</span> this happiness comes over me, just like that and I think it was...I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I was able to go down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and it it was, you know, the situation was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I didn't know...at that time I didn't know where my sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I didn't know where my parents was, but I was joining a group of friends and for some reason that made me happy and also what was so important in those times was my Jewish identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It helped me tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I had something in common with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I knew that other Jews were taking care of me and it gave me a sense of family and that was very important and and finding out all of this on my own...nobody telling me this, gave me a sense of security because I knew that within I was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">The things that were happen...were happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span> uh could only touch me if I let them touch me, and this was the most important lesson I think that I've learned in my whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Uh and it's true I made also a lot of friends during that time, good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Uh and these friends, they helped me an awful lot to get through it and I hope that I was able to help some of these people too. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I did meet up with some later on and we stayed in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> until 194....1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Could you...before you move on...could you tell me...you said that you were, you were in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Can you tell me a little bit about the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">This is...I'm coming to it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="407">laughter) So we were in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> until 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Well, in 1943 Hitler became even in a bigger hurry to kill all the Jews so these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They were not raided anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Now this was getting to be serious business, and this organization...what to do with all of these children that they had on their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Some of the children went into private Christian homes. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Some of us, my sister included, went to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">That <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milleau</span> (ph), in the southern central part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">A little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And life in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> was completely different than what we had ever known. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">As a matter of fact I had hardly given it a thought that I knew some people were Christians, gentiles, but we were used to calling the others but I had never really mixed with anybody especially that was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I had lived in a Jewish world, so this was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I learned about baby Jesus, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And the story was so appealing to me and what happened was that I became...I thought to myself, this 1s nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Why shouldn't I turn Catholic? </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I wanted to turn Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I liked the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The sisters were very very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Uh as a matter of fact only one sister really knew that we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The others did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It was a <span class="BUILDING">school convent</span> so we learned catechism. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I know a lot about the Catholic religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It's true we could not ta...partake of communion and I don't know really how they got around that, but we did not take communion but we did everything otherwise what the other Christian children did. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">There too the older ones took care of the younger ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I remember I took care of a little girl, and I still remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Her name was Violet. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Now she was a little Catholic girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">She had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">She would not let anybody touch her. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">She had a mental problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But I liked that little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I still remember how she looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">She had curly hair, dark curly hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">She had kind of a dark skin and I liked that. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I always was so white that I always liked somebody that had a dark skin, so I took a liking to her but I knew that if I would touch her she would pull away. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But I used to kind of flirt with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I used to smile at her, talk to her, and eventually I was able to just play a game with her of touching and soon we became friends and I was able to touch her. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And that gave me a lot of satisfaction, because I was the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">In that <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> we also uh had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It's true we had chestnuts for breakfast, for lunch and dinner, but 1t was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But to this day I don't like chestnuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">On Sundays we used to get chocolate milk, but it isn't chocolate milk like we have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It was like a very...almost like a between a pudding and between a chocolate milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It was very thick, but I loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It was delicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And uh we had bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">We had soups. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We even had some meat once in a blue moon, and...but we were not starving anymore and we slept between two sheets, which was luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We used to uh do work for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I learned how to sew, how to do embroidery. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I learned how to knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We also were farmed out to farmers and I learned how to cut grapes and also uh to pull weeds and to pull bugs off potato leaves because they didn't have insecticides in those days, so this was done by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And we used to do things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Could we at this point pause? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We need to change tapes and then we'll come back to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Uh tell me more about the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Tell me, tell me what con...what it was like being in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">It was (cough), it was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I happened to like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Uh the sisters had a lot of faith and when bombings were going on, for instance, instead of going down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , they would have us go out in the in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and uh we would hold hands and uh we would just form a circle and dance around and the only protection that we would have would be a piece of wood that we we would put between our teeth and the bombs would fall and there we were, just dancing around. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It's true though that they had a big sign on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and I forgot what it was...saying that they couldn't bomb the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> because it was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">There was some kind of a sign saying you cannot bomb here but you know, whether that would hold true that they would honor that or not who knows, but that's what 1t was and nothing ever did happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We need to stop the tape... PAUSE
QUESTION:  Tell me about the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and bombing raids on the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You had started a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">In the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , when uh the air raids would start, we didn't go down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">What we used to do, we used to out into the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> ...1nto the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and there we would hold hands and dance around the circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And the only protection that we used to have was a piece of wood that we would take between our teeth so we would not bite our tongue, and it's true that there was a sign on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> letting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> know that they should not bomb the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , but whether they would actually uh do this or or not, we really weren't that sure, so we were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But the sisters, they had a lot of faith and that's the way we did it, and I'm here to tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Uh the other thing that I remember is that one day we were walking...we always used to walk to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> two by two, and we were in uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I used to stand out because I had blond hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">The children, most of the children who were French, have dark hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Dark hair, usually a darker skin, but my hair no one had cut for quite some time so it was very long, very blond. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I looked very very German. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">While <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milleau</span> was occupied and there were Nazis walking all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and as we walked towards the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , suddenly a Nazi comes up to me, started stroking my face, started stroking my hair, and I was petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I could not look at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I was trembling. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And it was just fortunate that the sister who had been walking in front of the <span class="DLF">line</span> just happens to turn around and saw what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">She came towards him and started talking to him and he let me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And thank God I had the presence of mind not to open up my mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It was a frightening experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Uh the other thing that I remember is that, like I say, I liked the story of Jesus. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I was really taken up by it and I want to convert. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And I told the sisters, I said to that one sister, I said, . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">1 still remember her name... , | would like to become Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And she would shake her head and she says, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I don't think your fath...your father and mother would like that, and I would say, it would be so much easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And it's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I was thinking it would be so much easier to be a Christian than to be Jewish but somehow I never did do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But they are children, and many of them who did convert and who after leaving the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> did become Christians or were adopted by Christian families. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We lost an awful lot of kids that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But my sister and I, we stayed Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Also we were in two different <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">My sister, she had...by then she still was sickly and she also was starting to come down with TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So in those years whenever you had something like that, they said you should go out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so they sent my sister...at first they just wanted to send my sister out to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , and I argued with them and I said to them, if you send my sister, I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And I was very stubborn and so they had us both go and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balmal</span> (ph), to another <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and there it was, it was a <span class="BUILDING">farming convent</span> and we used to help take care of some of the livestock. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Well one day the sister told me take care of this cow, to take her to a certain <span class="DLF">pasture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Well, I've never been good at directions and I took her to the wrong <span class="DLF">pasture</span> because when I came back with her, the poor cow was all bloated and the sister was furious with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">She says from now on I cannot trust you with the cows, so you're going to have to feed the pigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I know you can't do anything wrong feeding the pigs, so here I was, a nice little Jewish girl who doesn't eat any pork, feeding the pigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Uh we learned how to church butter and we ate butter for the first time in years, and oh did it taste good but the only trouble is we had a little bit of butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We didn't have enough bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">At least it wasn't enough bread for me, and I was always hungry for bread, butter and jelly. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I used to dream about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> until the war was almost over with and then this organization took us back and we went back to one of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And there we stayed until it was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Tell us, tell us about the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell us first...did you find out...you had met up with your sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Did you find out where she had been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Uh not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We didn't talk about things like that that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It was...our talk was more about the everyday things, you know...what we were going to...eating was of the utmost importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We always talked about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Uh we used to do a lot...I remember I used to do a lot of running. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Again the older children took care of younger children. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I seemed to have a certain aptitude to take care of like uh...I remember I took care of a boy who was a uh hemo...hemophilia I think...where they bleed. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I had to be very careful with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Uh II had to make sure that he would not run, that he wouldn't cut himself and I used to take him for walks. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We used to sit under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> for hours at a time, and uh he was my responsibility at times I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Uh and then I used to take care of other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And uh we were, we were busy walking, exercising, uh like I say learning about what we could eat, what we couldn't eat, and also sitting down and learning French. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We used to play games. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Uh we had uh we used to dance like I learned to dance the __ there because we were all Jewish...butt different...there were children from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">There were children from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , from all different nationalities, uh not only German. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I learned how to speak a little Yiddish, so it was...uh I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We didn't even...I don't think we even did that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">For the most...we were weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We didn't weigh very much, and we concentrated more or less on our health and what we had to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Uh oh we washed clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I was always very particular as to how I look, and I...this story I got from my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">She used to say whenever there...because in many of those <span class="BUILDING">chateaus</span> they were old. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">There was no running water for instance, so we had to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> but winter time comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It was too cold and most of the children wouldn't do it, but here I was, taking my <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , no matter how cold it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Or I would wash clothes out which a lot of the other children wouldn't do, and uh as a matter of fact I...there was a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I remember him because he used to come to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on horseback and uh he used to be quite fond of me and uh he used to call me Mignon (ph) which means sweet in French and uh he had another name for me which I...which escapes me now, and uh he was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">He was very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The other thing that I had was a paren (ph), a god mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And usually I don't tell this story but I think here it's OK to...you know, I should tell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Uh she would send me money every month and there I had this money. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">As a matter of fact it's in my documents, her name is, and uh she would send me money and I had all this money and I didn't really know what to do with all that money but I just saved it and once in a while some...we would get, we would be able to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and so I would buy a fountain pen with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I bought some uh uh shoe polish with it once, and uh I quarreled with my sister because she used too much shoe polish, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I said to her, do you think that I can spend all this money on shoe polish and you use it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">She remembers that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">She remembers all the terrible things I did to her, and one day we had gone into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I bought all the children ice cream and I felt likeabig because I had all that money, and why I had that power I don't know to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But she wanted to adopt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Later on I found out, but she wouldn't take my sister and I wouldn't go without my sister and that was after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">As a matter of fact when the war was over with this organization having all of us on their hands, one of the things they did was advertise in the , which is a German-Jewish newspaper and it circulates in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in those days, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and my grandmother was the first one to read the advertisement that the org...that they had put in that paper saying that they Beata and Suzie Stern were looking for any living relatives and it was from my grandmother that we heard first. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">She sent us a letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  From where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  From <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And I was over-joyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I thought oh, my grandmother is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Because by then I was constantly worried...would anybody be alive and what would become of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I mean can you imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Here we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Two little girls and realizing that their...the letters from our parents had stopped after a while we were in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So I knew something happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Also by then there were a lot of rumors going around. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I mean I don't know whether...I don't know whether we knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all those terrible camps or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I just remember something terrible was happening to people, but it was not a descriptive type of a information that I received or or knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I just knew something terrible happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">As a matter of fact, after I didn't hear from my parents, I became uh very scared and I wouldn't talk for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">They had a hard time getting me to talk again because I was so afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Uh and I used to constantly worry...think what will become of us? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">What's going to happen to Suzie and I? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So when I heard from my grandmother it was just really something to me, and then my uncle also wrote, and soon we heard from my aunts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and my uncle and aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Well, everybody wanted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They all said, come to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We'll see that you get out and we'll take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So we had a choice but this paren, she also wanted me and she even said what a wonderful life you will have with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I, I had...I always wrote her thank you and she communicated with me too whether I don't...I haven't found any of her letters amongst the letters that I have but there was some kind of communication and it must have been by word mou...mou...mouth and word. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And I just know she also wanted to adopt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But I said no, because she wouldn't take my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because I remembered my grandmother, but my sister said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Let's go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , because that's the shortest route. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Now we have been traveling all this time, constantly, and my sister probably was even more tired than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And so she thought, well, it's the shortest route. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Let's go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So I said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So one day they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to process all the papers I imagine and this...there was a lady in who was a friend to one of my aunts and she knew that my mother was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so my aunt had told her about us and that we might see her and to watch out for us and low and behold, we met up with her and to this day I call her Tanta Santa (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And she came with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I remember I had all this money and I thought to myself, I don't need this money anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I should give it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And I said to Santa, I said to her, you know, I'd like to give this money to a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Why to a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Why I want to give the money away? </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But I said to her, I don't need this money. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Take this money and give it to a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So I gave her the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Now it's interesting...at that time I really didn't know it was to her that I gave the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I found that out years and years later when I discussed this part of my life with her, and she said to me, Beata (ph), you gave me that money. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">It was me you gave it to. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And I saw to it that that money went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And like I say, what prompted me to do this I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Then uh also the other thing we did while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was Tanta Santa and I, she had lost her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">She didn't know where her husband was. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I didn't know whether...where my parents were. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I didn't know there was a cousin who I was very fond of...his name was Robert...and his mother who was, had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> with my mother, Aunt Clara...I want to find out where all these people had gone to, where they were, whether they were still alive, and they had lists in certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> ...they must have been public places, so we went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to all these different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and we would look at these lists, looking for my parents and other relatives and she looking for her moth...for her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We would go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other and it was terrible for us because we would never see the names, so we knew, you know, they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And we did that...we were...I, I had forgotten...we were a few days there, and we never did find any of the names, but we always, every morning I remember we used to have hope and we would go out and she would take me around. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Every evening we would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> dead tired and we felt so bad, so desolate and so sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Then after a few days it was time to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , SO we went and it was one of the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> ...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I think you need to back up to explain something for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Your aunt, or as you called her your aunt, had taken you from to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">How did you make arrangements to go where with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  Well, she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">She made all the arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I...that was out of my hands because I didn't know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I was just...I was by then twelve years old, so I didn't know that much but I knew...she wanted...I wanted to go with her because I must have been...I was very close to her and when, probably when she said she was looking for her husband, I must have said well I'd like to look for my parents and for my Aunt Clara and so I used to go with her and she remembers me doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And uh that's how, but then she stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">She didn't come on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and then we were about uh I think we were about fifteen, sixteen children who boarded that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">It was one of the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> and suddenly there were rumors on board that the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span> were mined, and we thought, oh my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We've come this far to be blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And uh we got scared but after a while we noticed there was uh mine sweepers going ahead of us and everything was alright, or not quite alright because there was a storm and it was such a rough voyage...most of us kids were throwing up all over and we were so sick and so miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Lucky for us there were some Waves aboard and that was my first experience meeting Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Absolutely wonderful to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Washed our faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Cleaned our clothes off and made it bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Well we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and there was my uncle who had come to meet us, and uh I was over-joyed at seeing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Being with a family again. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Living in a regular <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">My aunt spoke French, which was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I by then had a hatred for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I hated the idea that I was born in such a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I was ashamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I was ashamed of being German. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I was almost ashamed of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Where all these feelings came from I don't know exactly but I was... was ashamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I didn't want to speak German, so my aunt spoke French with us and uh they were good to us, but times were difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were all broken, because of the bombings there and there was cardboard on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Uh food was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I remember my aunt tried so hard to uh get sugar so she could bake some cakes, or even just bake. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Uh we had to start going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">My aunt thought it would be good if we started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but at first she uh used to tutor so we would learn English, and he was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and and at that time, through those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , in fairly good condition except we had calluses on our feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">We didn't have shoes and we used to go bare-footed so much of the time, so the calluses were about an inch thick and it was very painful after a while, these calluses, and we had to go to a foot doctor and slowly get all that layer of callus taken off. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Uh the doctor was so nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Uh my aunt still talks about him to this day because he would not accept a penny for any of it when he heard our story because he had never seen feet that callused. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Oh, I forgot to tell you too and the only other shoe that I remember wearing was in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> they gave us some which are wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">But they are also very hard because we didn't have the nice little slippers to fit into the —_ so we used to just wear the wooden show and most of the time I didn't like them. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They didn't feel very comfortable and so I used to kick them off and just walk bare-footed. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But we suffered, I suffered very badly from uh those calluses. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Uh we were malnourished to some extent but my aunt managed to get us as much food as possible and we were under the doctor's care, the foot doctor care and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Uh I started to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">My aunt and uncle were orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford Hill</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and there were a lot of Hasidim (ph) and it was a lovely <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I absolutely loved it and it was good living uh there. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I felt I was again with my family, so uh I started this uh Victor (ph) High School, but it was hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I could not sit still. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I didn't have any patience. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I always wanted to be on the go. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And it was too hard for me because not only was I learning English, they were teaching us a awful lot of Hebrew, the . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">We studied __. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">It was all too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I was just overcome because I had never had any really formal Hebrew uh lessons before, and finally I told my aunt I don't want to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I just don't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">At first she more or less told me yes I had to go, so I got in to trouble at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the teachers must have contacted her and that was the end of my schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And so she had me take uh sewing lessons because I was quite...I was good at sewing and my uncle had a...he manufactured handbags in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so I learned how to use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> and I would help him with that, but again it was sitting and I just could not sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So he says OK, if you can't sit how about going to uh to some of the people I do business with and I'll give you samples of my handbag and you show it to them and see whether they want to buy any. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So I went to these different uh <span class="NPIP">places</span> and uh showed the samples and I would take the orders, bring them back to my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">He would box them up in big boxes and I still remember shipping (ph) them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> and taking them to the various <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and so that was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">My other job was taking care of my little cousin and I made myself quite useful and I alwa...my aunt always gave me money. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">She says since you work for me, here's money. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So I had money again, and I always used to go to the movies with my friends and I had a very good social good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Uh we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> until 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Then my...I had two aunts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and an uncle and they decided it would be best for us to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And also one of the reasons was that my father had written them a letter saying that if anything should happen to him or his wife, that we are to go to them, because they were the sisters of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So they took this letter and they said this is your father's wish so this is what you should do. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Well, they had trouble with me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I didn't want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I loved it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I liked the religious life. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Uh I liked living among the Hasidim (ph) because they were so joyful. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I loved going to the... had a girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">She was Hasidish and I would enjoy going to services with her and I enjoyed...I remember attending the weddings and it seems almost every week somebody was getting married. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Anyhow this was our social outlet and I just loved it, and my aunts had a hard time convincing me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But uh then at the end of uh October in '47, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , we came to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and I don't know how much more of my story you want or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Bea, you went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">What did you...
ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Now on one year of schooling in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the little bit I had in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , somehow I managed to get into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I had to take a test, but I passed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">But I remember the principal when I told him how little schooling I had, he was very doubtful that I could even pass the test, and uh he says it really would be better if you would start <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And he probably was right, but I didn't want to because I wanted to be with my own peers. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And so I started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I graduated but my goal in life was to have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a husband and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So two weeks after graduating <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I got married and uh soon after I started my family and I have four daughters and three of them are married and I have five grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  What do you think the effect of the war, of the Holocaust was on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  On me? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I think that I have learned to cope better with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Uh it has shown me though what man can do to man and how inhumane they can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I am because of it not that trustful of people in general but I am thankful that I am here. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I know a lot of survivors feel guilty that they are here, but I don't have that guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Uh I'm more thankful and also because I feel that I have survived that uh my speaking out on what happened in those days is more or less uh saying well, you know, something terrible has happened to our people, but I'm going to tell everybody that I can about it, and make sure that something like that will never happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Bea, thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  You're welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Conclusion of Interview </span>
