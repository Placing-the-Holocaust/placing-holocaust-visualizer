<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Did you...what what was it like being a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Uh, I would say you didn't really feel it, being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was uh in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novisad</span> itself you...there was no anti-Semitism to speak of. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Matter of fact uh the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was uh one of the nicest <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> I've every seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Old <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which incidentally was uh built by my mother's father who was an architect, gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Indeed, 1t was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was separated for women, (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was just a beautiful, beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was never destroyed by the way during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The Hungarians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They never destroyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">As far as I know it still stands. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But, of course, there's uh...now there's there's no, hardly any Jewish left in...I don't know what they're using the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> for, but it was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And as I say, as a child we didn't know what it meant to be uh Jew or non- Jew...they're all mixed and uh it was really a very normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">A very healthy and beautiful life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  When did this start to change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Well, of course, it started to change as a matter of fact even...let's see...in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when Hitler started, you know, 1n'36 and then '37. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We had in my class in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we had some uh native Germans, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They called them schwabs (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="56">The German minorities and they already started, you know, uh sort of uh secretively first uh German sympathizers and uh talking loud and proud, you know, about the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Hitler and you started feeling a certain extent already uh but uh even then it wasn't too bad, but of course when the war broke out...let's see...in '39...I would say...let's see...1n '39...then in '41 it was not too bad in in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but when in '41 the Hungarian army came in and occupied uh the <span class="REGION">territory</span> ...there was northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> where I lived... Voitvodina, and uh then uh of course when they came in they started uh...we were, as I...well...as I said I was half-Jew, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But they were, regardless, the half-Jews and the Jews uh had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in uh the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Just working every day, but we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The real trouble started in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">In 1942, we heard some rumors...it was in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was a very cold winter, one of the coldest we ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">If I recall it was like uh...with the celstus now, twenty-three below zero which was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> was frozen and we heard some rumors that uh Hungarian gendarmes are murdering Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We said it's just, it's just rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Nobody took it very seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And on the 23rd of January, there was a proclamation over the radio that no Jews or half-Jews can leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Everybody has to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Still didn't realize what this all meant, but of course we couldn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Then sometime in the morning uh my neighbor's, maid came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">She was a Hungarian girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">She walked across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she said that she heard some rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They saw some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> , some big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and they saw blood in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So we still didn't realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We still this...this is rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Must have been cattle or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Then I remember around eleven o'clock in the morning, the doorbell rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">If I recall I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> ...there was three Hungarian gendarmes and uh...OK...they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">The first thing they did...uh we had a maid also...first thing they asked the maid - how is your boss? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">How are they treating you? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And she said, oh, very fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Then they came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They spoke to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">One of the officers went in to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We had a big <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , a lot of Hungarian books. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Oh, he says...you are Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He said yeah, you know, we're not Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We read Hungarian literature and as a matter of fact I have uh a cousin in in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> who's in the Hungarian army, which happened to be true. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Not that it meant too much, but uh...and I still didn't realize the danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I didn't know what's happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you know...what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And they asked a few more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They talked to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Dadada. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So that was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">A few minutes later my aunt, my mother's sister, who's also gentile but her husband was Jewish...she came over crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They took her husband away. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, so we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We still...you start worrying but you still don't know what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And in the evening, that evening, we heard rumors that people were getting killed and actually those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were carrying people and the blood was human blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Well next morning we found out what happened...about uh fifteen to two thousand Jews were murdered, including...my uncle across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was not murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He was saved luckily. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He was already down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> being ready to shot and at the last minute came an order from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , from Horthy's uh <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , to stop the the killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But another uncle, another aunt...uh two uncles matter of fact, two aunts, their daughter, everybody was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They were taken down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> , shot and thrown into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They had to dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> because as I said it was frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Then it was frozen so they had to dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and throw the bodies into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The only survivor was the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Their little dog was crying the next day...we went over there to see what happened and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was all set for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The food, everything was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> ...it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The dog crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And then you heard the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Then you heard, this was killed, who was killed, what was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Some people were not taken to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> like down the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a good friend of mine who was my teacher at one time...they were killed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Shot from close range. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And then, you know, we heard that this friend and this friend was killed and we didn't know about the Serbs (ph) yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Then we heard that the Serbs were killed also. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">A lot of Serbs, a lot of Serbs were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was January 23rd, 1942, but that was only one day that they did the killing in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And then everything stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Then a few days later we decided to leave my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novisad</span> , and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and there life was still quite normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My aunt lived there, who was gentile and uh my uncle of course and her family and we uh uh rented an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and uh lived there oh quite normally for about uh I would say nine months, ten months. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Then uh one day they said...again it was in the papers... everybody who is Jewish or half-Jewish, you know, has to register...police department I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They said that uh in a few days we have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They didn't say exactly where in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then when we went down there we got a white band so that distinguished you from a full Jew, from a hundred percent Jew...the white band. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">No star. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Just a white band. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And then we were taken, we were transported to uh a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hajduhatasza</span> (ph) was the name...about uh oh hundred kilometers uh south from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Was a camp sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Hard work, unloading uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> , building <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , you know, and uh just work everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It it wasn't really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I was uh I can honestly say that at that time we were not really suffering there. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">However, uh in the very beginning as a matter of fact we were even permitted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> on the weekend, you know, to see our parents and ...
QUESTION:  What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> like at that time...when you went back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="145"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was still normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And uh the Jewish were still living, you know, in pretty normal circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then I uh recall one time when we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on a weekend, I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and it stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> next to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...see, and...let me see now...that was the year after, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Now the year after, when I was still going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was coming, and it was full of people, and at first we didn't know...1t was all locked up, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...you know, those cattle, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was locked up and we saw people in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and crying and asking for water...then we realized...Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , transported, you know, to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We didn't know where they were going, you know...we found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They are taking them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was a horrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Uh and as I say, then after one year we couldn't, of course they stopped us going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They said we couldn't go back any more to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and from then on...that was...let's see...from '42 to '44, but uh we you know, we were moved from that <span class="REGION">area</span> to another <span class="REGION">area</span> which was near the <span class="DLF">Romanian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Also same type of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Luckily we had a pretty good commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Our commander was a pretty nice guy so uh we were not uh really suffering too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were worse off than ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">In uh...let me see now...this is '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Yeah, and then one day of course I heard uh the the German troops, of course, the German troops were going through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and uh one day uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German train</span> stopped and I was talking to this uh German officer...spoke German, of course...and uh asked him what's going on and he told me he just heard that uh the Americans landed. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was June 6th, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But he says we aren't worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He says, you know, we are very confident, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And of course he didn't know who I was really so he was talking to me like nothing was going to happen, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Was in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Uh now uh about uh...let's see...a few months later, see as the Russian armies were getting now closer already to that <span class="REGION">area</span> , I had a friend of mine, an older...about seven or eight years older than I was...told me that uh one of these days now, Cornel, he says we are going to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We cannot stay here any longer, because eventually they're going to take us from here to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else and, you know, we don't know what's going to happen, so we cannot stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You know, his plans where to take me with him to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , escape and go to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and, of course, he knew that I spoke Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And uh in fact the Russian army was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He, he ......for selfish reasons but more that he knew that I'm going to be able to communicate with the Russians and which is going to help him indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  What was it like for you at that time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> (ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Not really, because I think that the commander knew that the Russians are...of course, he knew, he knew that the Russians are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It was obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And he figured if he is nice to us, it's going to be better for him you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So uh, which was true in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But anyway, so this uh friend of mine, one day uh we were told that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to pull out, oh in about three or four hours and go to some other <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Didn't know where but anyway we're leaving this this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So he told me...he says, Cornel - the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulls out - we're going to stay here and escape at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started pulling out...for a moment I was hesitating because I tried to stay with my younger, you know, friends, with my own age friends, but he pulled my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And we stayed and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We, of course, left the <span class="NPIP">place</span> right away and we went in to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Yeah, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And we took, of course, the bands off but we still didn't look like Hungarian farmers, so uh, you know, you were not a hundred percent safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Anyway, we went to the <span class="REGION">country side</span> and we went off the <span class="DLF">road</span> , off the <span class="DLF">highway</span> because the <span class="DLF">highway</span> was dangerous because, you know, the the German troops...they were already retreating and the Hungarians, but they were going on the <span class="DLF">highways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And besides uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> were coming and bombing the <span class="DLF">highways</span> , so we went off the <span class="DLF">road</span> and uh we were hiding somewhere, you know, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and I remember, at one time they said these troops, the Hungarian troops...they stopped on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and the Hungarian...some of the soldiers were coming towards us because we were near a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> or something, and they were coming closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So my friend said now let's act very normally and calm, because uh...and they came, they saw us and they said uh, what what are you guys doing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I said we missed our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We sold them a bill, bill of goods, you know, and they believed it, fortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So later on at night when the sun went down we saw a Romanian...there was a a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> see at that time...we saw a Romanian farmer and we called him closer and said uh please...we didn't speak Romanian but he understood...and says, you know, try to hide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We have to uh get away, and he did take us in, fortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He took us in and we were hiding in his little <span class="DLF">farm</span> there for about uh three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He was feeding us OK and we heard the Russians, you know, the cannons, getting closer and closer and uh he says when when...today...tomorrow, you know...and he told us that the Russians are celebrating a few miles away, but they're not coming yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They're still not here, so he can't let us loose see. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And oh I think next morning he comes up. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">He says the Russian and the Romanian soldiers are here so we are safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So we came down from our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and the first thing, the first Romanian soldier I met took my watch, took my shoes, which were not too good but obviously looked better than his...oh yes...you know...we figured liberated, you know, they're going to put their arms around us...anyway, but we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We knew we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So then we started walking back to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , which was as I say from there perhaps about eighty, ninety, hundred miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But this guy had these shoes with a nail in his shoes and (laughter) 1t was not easy to walk but there was not too much transportation and uh as we were walking, of course, we passed Russians and at one time we came to a <span class="DLF">crossroad</span> and uh some Russians soldiers standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I saw an officer and he looked sort of like could have been Jewish...I wasn't sure but I talked to him, and he says, I'm Jewish, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But he says don't say anything because the soldiers don't know that I'm Jewish, said the Jewish officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The Russian soldiers don't know and doesn't want it to be known, and you don't say anything either. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And uh another time also I met some Russians and they they asked...first thing they asked, they said who are you. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I said Yugoslav. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Says well how come you're not in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> fighting? </span><span class="sentence" id="212">How come you're here? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">See, they didn't know what was going on really. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So I told him...I said I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> and you know, I I just ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So we managed and later on as a matter of fact we were lucky enough to uh get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian truck</span> and uh they took us to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So we wound up in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> which was a small, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was like normal times. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Food, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Of course his wife, she was gentile and they were still all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Everything was fine and I stayed uh there for about two, three months I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And then I heard...somebody came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and I found out that my parents who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> are still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And everything is, you know, it's OK there. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And about a week later I uh, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian transport</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and as I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , it was one day after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">People were still on the <span class="DLF">street</span> of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">People are uh dying and smoke all over and they came to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they said give us bread for anything...gold, you know, jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They are starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">People are starving on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">You could still hear the cannons and everything because the Germans just left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , you know, the day before (cough) and then uh, of course I went to my <span class="BUILDING">parent's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I found out where they live. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I came to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You can imagine the reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Because you know my mother didn't know exactly you see what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">My uh...then I found out of course about my uh older brother who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , in in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> , with the Mihajlovic army, that he was killed the year before, uh May 8th, 1944, yeah...he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Uh let's see, then uh...
