ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Name and address, where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Werner Goldsmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Originally it was Goldschmidt (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="4">That's the German equivalent of Goldsmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So 1t was Werner Goldschmidt in German and of course I've anglicized it to Werner Goldsmith, shortly after my arrival in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the uh fall of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Uh I was born in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , E - F - U-R - T, which today is in what used to be the German Democratic Republic, soon to be the Reunited Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It's the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saringia</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Uh major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saringia</span> (ph), the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saringia</span> of about over two hundred thousand population. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh about one- third the size of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , if you will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  And tell us a little bit about what...
ANSWER:  Oh, my date of birth...[ was born on the 13th November, 1928, in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  And then tell us a little bit about what you remember from your youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Quite a bit from my youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Now the early years, as I say, the infant years and the toddler years, naturally who can remember those years, which means the first four years one doesn't remember anything or hardly anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So my remembrance starts roughly in 1933 I suppose which 1s also the beginning, as chance would have it, of the Third Reich and uh so that's when my uh thinking starts, and as I think back on 1933 and 1934, I cannot think of anything unpleasant that happened to me in those early years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Do you remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">In '33 and '34 I wasn't in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">This was <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I mean this was...
QUESTION:  Let's go on to where your parents...
ANSWER:  Uh I was in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and I had no unpleasant experiences in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">This would be around 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">In 1935 I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the Schiller (ph) Schule (ph) or the <span class="BUILDING">Schiller School</span> on <span class="DLF">Schiller Street</span> , <span class="DLF">Schiller Plaza</span> , and this is where I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in uh around Easter time, 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh what do I remember there? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The first year, 1935, not too unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">1936 uh things started to deteriorate as far as Jewish people were concerned and the Third Reich and it became less pleasant in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I was the only Jewish boy in the in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> ....
QUESTION:  Do you remember any incidents that...you say it became less pleasant...
ANSWER:  Well, there were a few times when I was hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But uh it wasn't assault and battery exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I mean I was dealt with in a rude, crude sort of fashion but I wasn't actually uh beaten to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> or anything like that, but there uh were some very curt, unpleasant behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My parents decided to take me out of <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and put me in a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , which they did, and I spent uh 1937 to '38...anyway in 1937 I was in <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I never got a chance to really attend <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which I qualified for, the German college prep school, because in 1938 all Jews were driven from the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ...be they faculty, teachers, administrative personnel, students, pupils, young, old...all Jewish people in in the school system was removed so that ended my official schooling in in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the Third Reich.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Did...how...how about during this period...can you tell us a little about your family life, your father, your mother...
ANSWER:  My father was a wholesale salesman, textile salesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Did a lot of traveling in the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saringia</span> and the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hefner</span> (ph), which adjoins it to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He was gone a lot of the time, so I was really...1t was my mother really that was in charge ninety percent of the time, as I remember, because he was gone on his uh business, and so she was running the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she was running me and very nicely I might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I had no complaints. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was an only child and I would say I was spoiled, at least the landlady in in in my <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , who's still alive, she considered me very much a spoiled child. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Spoiled brat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of your friends or...
ANSWER:  I remember a few, very very slim few little children of which I was one of them and uh these were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">In fact in my in my family album there are some photos of myself and a few of my childhood friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My mother took photos and uh so they survive in pictures to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But uh I can't remember a hell of a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It uh...what I remember wasn't...my home life was not unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I I can't say...I, in my memoir I pointed out that I had a... my my my mother and my father both tried as much as possible within within their human means to insulate me from the increasingly unpleasant situation for the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the Third Reich which became with, year to year, came in a descending spiral and they insulated me as much as possible and gave me a fairly normal home life and fairly decent life and so I, until 1938, things really were not too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I do remember quite vividly though on a number of occasions going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , still to the old <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">There were the Hitler youth, uniformed Hitler youth, and these were of course the advance, the advance guard of youthful Hilterites and they were were just only too anxious, to willing to beat up on a youngster who was not in uniform, because a youngster not in uniform of a Hitler youth or a Young Pioneer meant one of two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Either he belonged to a family that was anti-Hitlerean (ph) and didn't want their child to be a Hitler youth, or he was a Jew or gypsy, and if they say a child who was not uniformed, he immediately was to be attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So I remember as much as possible of keeping clear of the Hitler youth (laughter), even seeing them a block away would usually mean that I would walk in the opposite direction and so I I managed quite well uh to keep out of their, out of their uh clutches as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  You mentioned this wasn't until 1938...
ANSWER:  Until 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">By 1938 of course I no longer was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , since all Jews were out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> , and by then also, early 1938, my father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Heart condition, very ill for his final six months and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Luckily he died because he never would have survived the trip to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald concentration camp</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So he died and uh my mother and I then moved shortly thereafter, not immediately, shortly thereafter we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which as things proved to be a very sensible move. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Had we remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> neither she or I would have survived the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">By moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we moved into a milleure (ph) that enabled her to make contact which enabled enabled her eventually to place me with a children's transport for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and enabled her as a widow eventually to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and so we both survived by probably for two reasons, moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , number one, and her incessant efforts to get us out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">You see, my father, as I remember him, always was like many other German Jews...he felt that these these uh wild elements, these Nazi elements, would never be able to capture the whole power. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They would never be able to descent to what they descended into. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And so he always had this optimistic view, and he couldn't get himself to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">To him <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he had no intention of leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My mother would have left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1935 if he had been willing. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But anyway, we remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and finally she was a widow in '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Her incessant work finally enabled me to get to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with a transport of kids and she, as a widow, eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and thus she saved both our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  So then in 1938 you were separated from your mother, 1s that when it happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  In 1938 we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I was not separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">In 1939, in 1939 I was separated from my mother, when I was associated with this transport of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">All the children said goodbye on the <span class="DLF">train platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">For many, for all the children in fact, it was the last time they saw their their parents, because all these married uh folks, these married couples, they couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Most of these children saw...for most of these kids on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , around thirty-nine children, thirty-eight of them said goodbye for the final time to their parents on that <span class="DLF">train platform</span> , taking us to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">By mother being a widow managed to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">She survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now let's go back to 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">You moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Now...once you're 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ...let's, let's go over what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I'm a little little unclear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> my mother had me placed for those months...I don't know whether it was at the very beginning, but I know I was there for a number of months to the end in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , she placed me with an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch</span> (ph) Orphanage. </span><span class="sentence" id="80"><span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And uh
QUESTION:  Was it basically a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Oh it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">In in '38, Jews were not permitted to associate with Aryans. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That would have been abso...oh disaster for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And uh so uh this was a Jewish children's home. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I can't say that all the children there were orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I wasn't an orphan, yet I was accepted by <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch</span> and there were other children who had families...uh par...parents, both parents alive and they were accepted by <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In other words, I think this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> accepted children whether they were orphans or not, because it was felt that in this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> they had some kind of a refuge from what was happening on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to Jews who were being beaten and trampled on and kicked upon, and with the police looking the other way if they happened to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The situation by 1938 was getting out of hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And late '38 you had this infamous Night of the Breaking Kristall (ph), Kristallnacht it was called in German, and uh that's when they really went went amuck, ran amuck, the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">When they attacked the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and set uh fire to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , smashed the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> , vandalized everything they could lay their hands on, beat adults and children when whenever they found someone because by that time adults and children above the age of ten I think or twelve, I'm not sure, had to have a Jewish star so you immediately could identify who was Jewish and who wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So you were living in in a terrible uh nightmare by 1938, but us being in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , around the clock, we were spared these outrages on Kristall...Kristallnight, which was right in late November...uh, not not...early November, early November 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Uh...
QUESTION:  Shortly after that you were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...
ANSWER:  Well, uh then it was 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Another month more passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Months more passed, and again I was in this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> , with lots of other kids, Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And as I say, Nazis did not invade this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We found ourselves sort of living like in a, like on a <span class="DLF">plantation</span> , sort of immunized from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> being a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> , a developing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> and we were in this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> and uh so we were there during the early months of '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Things uh like I've read about the pa...you know, looking back upon things, things got from bad to worse and from worse to even worse and but in the <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> things were relatively quiet and safe because we stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We didn't set foot <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for very sensible reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And uh finally in the summer of '39, the transport was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My mother had succeeded in getting me admitted to this transport and uh that's how I, along with thirty-eight other children, one fine summer day left on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I should also point out that in the year 1938 to '39, my mother lived with a Jewish lady as her uh sub-tenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">In other words, she lived with a Jewish lady on Hector Strasa (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> , un the western part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">At that time, of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was a unified <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and on <span class="BUILDING">Hector Strasa 21</span> my mother lived with a Jewish lady whose sub-tenant she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I can't really tell you what work she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I really can't tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Then you were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The kids went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , said goodbye to their parents on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and for all of them except one, my mother, was the last time they saw their parents, because they all died in the Holocaust, these these parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Children left for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and then we arrived in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span> (ph) , maybe fifteen to twenty miles southeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , where a French nobleman, Count formed a uh <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> for us thirty-nine children. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He had previously formed a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for probably an equivalent number of Spanish girls from <span class="REGION">Republican Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Spanish Republican refugee girls were also quartered, not in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but in a near-by <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , also one of 's charitable enterprises. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And so this is where we lived and it seemed at the time that this was our refuge, our <span class="DLF">port</span> in a developing storm. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Of course, like history tells us, things didn't remain so quiet and the <span class="DLF">port</span> in the storm wasn't a <span class="DLF">port</span> for very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">For for less than a year it was a port uh a <span class="DLF">port</span> in a storm. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">While I was at uh this this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Monsieur in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span> , just a few weeks later I got a letter suddenly from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I didn't know a soul in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I, but I recognized the handwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">A letter from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">She told me she had arrived 1n in in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and and was working for a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leatherhead</span> (ph) in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and and so I knew at that point that she was out, I was out and things looked pretty good at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about your life in this <span class="NPIP">French place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Well, was...we were all Jewish children, but it wasn't a Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Uh our counselors and teachers were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Our benefactor wasn't Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Uh we were not...we had no kosher cuisine. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We had no Jewish rules and regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was no Jewish instruction or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We led a uh totally non-Jewish assimilationist (ph) type of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Uh and I, like I state in my memoir, my guess is that most of the kids in the transport to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> came from assimilationist uh German-Jewish homes. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">There were no religious people that I can remember there among the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We all seemed to take to this secular type of life at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span> rather easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We seemed to fit in very very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I should also mention in in retrospect that my own parents did not have a very uh...did not run a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">My father came from very deeply religious parents, but he himself did not follow a deeply religi...religious life although he did go to <span class="BUILDING">schule</span> (ph) on the religious holidays and participated in the services. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My mother not at all, and so I remember not living in a in a really Jewish type of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We were living a assimilationist type of <span class="BUILDING">secular home</span> ...
QUESTION:  What activities did you have there? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Did you have classes? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Did you...
ANSWER:  Now we we are back again now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span> ...our activities were...we had uh French class. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We learned French. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I remember very well one of our teachers was a White Russian who pounded us (laughter)...verbs and syntax. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I remember very well...Madame Richter, R - I - CH-T-E-R, a Russian uh émigré from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Petersburg</span> for all I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Maybe even a member of the uh <span class="BUILDING">royal courts</span> for all I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh anyway uh maybe an instructress to some of the uh Russian uh noblemen, one-time noblemen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Petersburg</span> , and uh anyway Madame Richter, she really pounded French into us. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I remember that to this to this day and uh we had other French teachers and uh émigré teachers and uh...how shall I put it...uh teachers and uh counselors...that's the word I'm looking for, counselors...and none of them Jewish and so, as I say, it was a secular atmosphere and we played and we had our instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We had our three meals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">If there was anything lacking it was parental love. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That that was missing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">That's an important ingredient...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">That's one of the tragedies of my life...at this key period of my life, suddenly in 1939 my parental link was cut off, because receiving an occasional letter from my mother in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> 1s hardly a substitute for really living in one's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with one's parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Now how long were you in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yeah, two of us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> (ph), where once again we found ourselves in in a large <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of of kids, Jewish kids, refugee kids, orphan kids, maybe some French Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I have no...I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I was too young to make a a survey at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">This kind of thing I can do easily in retrospect but at the time I was a youngster and this 1s not the kind of thing that uh I could do at the time, or did do. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And other, two other kids, the other two from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charbon</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They too subsequently survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But I can report that the other fellow from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and myself who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> , both of us survived the war in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Uh that same year we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> , we were both lucky enough to be assigned to a transport destined ultimately for immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Because we had relatives living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">This was the decision that got us into the transport for the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> Had I not had relatives living in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> I wouldn't be sitting here perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">No guarantee that I wouldn't have come here ultimately uh because the other two kids at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charbon</span> , the other two from the original four, didn't have relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , and they also survived the war, one of who is in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , the other one in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , so I can't say that if I had not made that transport to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> in 1941, once again with OSE taking an important...playing an important role in that, uh I can't say that I wouldn't have survived the war, but chances are fifty-fifty, but this way my my problems were soon to be over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Did you know you had relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>

QUESTION:  On, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> you had counselors or somebody...
ANSWER:  Always guided by people in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">These kids, I mean us kids...we were kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">You didn't put these kids, you know, alone on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">There was always someone, adult, in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I couldn't give you the names and addresses but there were also, always throughout from the time I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span> to the time I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , always adults, be they teachers, be they counselors, be they people temporarily put in charge, always guided, people guiding this group of children, in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were never on our own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Werner, can you tell us a little bit more about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the trip itself...
ANSWER:  Well, we traveled through , the famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">medieval city</span> with the <span class="DLF">Roman wall</span> around it, and we traveled to andin _I think we changed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and then from we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...now we are really in the deep south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , southwest of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and from the city of we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> underneath and through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> , partially through <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , partially winding through uh narrow <span class="DLF">passageways</span> , went through and to this poverty-stricken <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> which really looks like a like a disaster area just shortly after the civil war was ended there, and this was just two years after the Spanish civil war...
QUESTION:  How how were the other children reacting with you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Oh, we were all very happy I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">How were we reacting. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We were all very happy to get out and you know <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was in our future. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I would say we were all very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I can't say that...I can't report anything negative about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was a very pleasant ride I would say and the and the the overnight time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> and the uh ten days at least we spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , I would say there was nothing unpleasant about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">By the way, at that time we had enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We didn't get up hungry from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We had enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We were fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Again it was the OSE which had uh charge of us, but I cannot guarantee the OSE had charge of us through this trip into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , because other elements entered the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt became charge, was charged with permitting five thousand Jewish children to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">A special bill had been passed or special legislation passed by Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Uh Mrs. Roosevelt was put in charge of this organization to help the children survive, to get five thousand kids out of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="REGION">occupied France</span> and unoccupied France, <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span> , get them to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Five thousand emergency visas apparently had been made available. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And so this was one group it helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Another group that played a big role, in fact they paid for the actual boat trip, the ship trip, was the American Friends Service Committee, the Quakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They...in fact we carried a a tag on our...around uh around our neck indicating that the American Friends Service Committee Headquarters, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , was was in charge of the trip, so they apparen...uh so anyway...
QUESTION:  How long were you...I don't mean to interrupt...how long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  I would say ten to fifteen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We were supposed to go originally with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Portuguese freighter</span> named <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nyassa</span> , N - Y - A- S-S-A, but the Nyassa never arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Instead eventually the Serpa Pinto, S - E- R - P

id="366">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> converted to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refugee vessel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And on this <span

class="sentence" id="368">A very slow trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The <span class="INT_SPACE">accommodations</span> ...we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> , the children were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">There were lots of adult refugees on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Uh there was nothing uh (laughter) nothing fancy about it, but like I put out, like I point out in my memoir of my childhood in refugee years, it was my most memorable trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I've made many trips across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span> since, by by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and by <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Nothing to equal that trip by this beaten-down <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Portuguese freighter</span> , the Serpa Pinto, making a long slow voyage by way of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casa Blanca</span> uh <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> where more adult refugees got on board, and then we finally stopped in <span class="COUNTRY">Bermuda</span> and uh I don't know...maybe to take on supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Nobody got on board uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Bermuda</span> and finally we arrived in the port of New York in September 1941 and our ...(pause)...well, the thing was at an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">It was the beginning of a new life, a new...wasn't ideal. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I mean I was with a Jewish foster family. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">My relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were not in a position to take me so I was placed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , with a foster family and that wasn't an ideal foster family. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Few foster families, incidentally, are ideal. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">There's been a whole spate (ph) of articles about foster care being very inadequate and I can testify to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Uh it wasn't wasn't bad exactly but it was totally lacking in in empathy, sympathy, real human sympathy and real love for the uh refugee children because I wasn't the only refugee child there that I was five years with that family, four years with that family and uh but anyway it was a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I went to an <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> , learned English, initiated the American...Americanization process, learned about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , about what it was to live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , uh played with the kids on the <span class="DLF">block</span> ...was a largely <span class="DLF">Jewish block</span> , every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was occupied by Jewish people, most of them immigrants from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> ...uh and uh that was my life and starting in late 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Came two and a half months past and Pearl Harbor took place and the U.S. was at war. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">When Pearl Harbor was announced that Sunday, the day of infamy as President Roosevelt called it, my English was still very spotty, very spotty. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It took another six months maybe before I was able to really uh get the hang of it, but they had me in an English uh <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> class uh sixth grade and uh so by hook and by crook I got my education. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Then I went to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Then I started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> and finally I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when my mother, in 1946 after the end of the war, was able to join me in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">QUESTION:  So you were with this family until...
ANSWER:  I was with this... was actually with two foster families. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The first fos...most of the time with the first foster family. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Then they left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I went to another foster family in that very <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I didn't...1t was like, 1t was like staying with the same family almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">The people lived a few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , was staying in the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , playing with the same kids, same atmosphere except that this family was a little perhaps a little more, had a little more empathy for refugees than the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I think the other family was in it primarily for the money, for the finan...financial support they got for taking in kids, and they didn't only take in refugee kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They took in Jewish kids from broken <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They took uh a baby in, a little infant, maybe ten months old who uh the mother had died, maybe in childbirth. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I couldn't say. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The father placed it with the family and the kid's name was Myron. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I still remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I don't remember the last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Uh but anyway they took anybody, anyone and anybody as long as they were paid for and they were paid by the Association for Jewish Children of Philadelphia. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">That was the organization which ran this operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Were you in touch with your mother at all during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Once I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I once again was able to correspond. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Of course, the war was going on in Europe but the U.S. and <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> were allies and once again I could have a correspondence with my mother, so we corresponded and one fine day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> ...it was in 1946...the war had ended just a year earlier...a telegram arrived from the , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish liner</span> , very well-known for its many humanitarian missions of evacuation and moving people, and this was a very short telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Arriving on the , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , Love, Mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And so shortly thereafter I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , my second trip to the port of New York...my first one, arrival in 1941, September...the second time 1946 of May, on a rainy day in May, a seventeen year old son (crying) whose childhood messed up, a seventeen year old son finally met his mother in the port of New York and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Finally then I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in New York and uh well, that you might say is the rather pertinent facts about my escaping the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I might add that my mother went to work for the United Service for New Americans, a refugee aid society in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , very important for the many refugees that came to these shores after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">United Service for New Americans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , after the after the refugee numbers diminished, the refugee service joined with the HIAS, Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, and today it is known as the United HIAS Service...still exists, uh for Jewish refugees.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  She lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and for a while longer I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , for a while longer, but shortly thereafter I joined her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , finished my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> year, my final <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and then I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> behind for good and then as I say I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , joined her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">She lived, but you see the story...I mentioned that too in the memoir that I wrote...childhood and refugee memoir...she had two good years in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> following her arrival here. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Her health was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Then she fell ill and got progressively worse with cancer and she was from one <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to another, trying all kinds of treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Nothing worked for her liver. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And finally, while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1952, she died in early 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Uh I was doing my military service, as I mentioned earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I got a telegram from the Red Cross that my mother had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Of course it was not a real surprise because I knew that she was in a terminal uh in a terminal stage, that she would not recuperate, that 1t was terminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And what I still find ridiculous was that the draft board, knowing this...they had a documentation from at least one doctor stating that her case was terminal and you would think that they would give this son of hers, her only son, a deferment. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The draft board saw that and says, can't help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">If we do that for you, we have to do it for a great many others and we wouldn't meet our quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">A very heartless way of for draft board a draft board to treat such a situation, where you knew in advance that you would probably never see your mother again, lying in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , you were being sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for your military duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You knew in advance that you saw her that last time before embarking for the , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that you'd probably never see her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That's the way it was, and then I heard next from the Red Cross that that she had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Then they flew me back for the funeral, yeah, the Army, so I was there for the funeral but uh they could have given me a deferment, but her case was terminal in in any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was very sad when you think of...she died at the age forty-nine, her life ruined in more ways than one, but she could be alive today and she would be around eighty-seven or eighty-eight today. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Eighty-eight.</span></p>
