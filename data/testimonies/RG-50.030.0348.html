<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  This was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Mostly, yes, mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Anybody else could go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  I'm trying to get a sense of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and whether you mixed with Gentiles that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  We mix with Gentiles? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Yes, 1f we had some neighbors, mostly where we lived, it were like, we had about three addresses where we lived a long time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Mostly were Jewish people, but some we had very good relations with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My parents were respected and loved in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Was there sort of a rich Jewish community culturally and politically that you were part of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  I tell you, this I tell you, we had a really <span class="BUILDING">Jewish observant home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">All the holidays, all the Saturdays and everything was really observed. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">When I became a teenager, I belonged to a Zionist organization, the Herzlia. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I never did anything that will, most my, my parents didn't know that I belonged to that organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Because either they were for it that a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> should be established, that we'd have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go like we used to have a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Girls were raised at that time not to have special, that they get independent, that they get a trade to make for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Not always stay with parents, stay 20 years with the parents and then you live by yourself and get married and have a family and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Well, I had different ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I wanted to first, I don't know where I got the idea, but I had my idea, I wanted to be independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Wherever I go and whatever I'm going to be; that was before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">That I can make a living somehow and not be dependent on anybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  So, what was the value of this Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Why were you doing it and what did they teach?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  The goal is to bring the youth, everybody that wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had to go as a pioneer and it was called the Altyah Bet. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That means illegal immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Because it was the English mandate, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">First before were the Turks, then the English came and they didn't let anybody in. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">People had to smuggle in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was to bring up now like we want to bring up the Jewish youth will remember the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">At that time, 1t was that the Jewish youth for the future they will come and settle in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , that was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , right, and build a <span class="REGION">land</span> and politically, that we can, what happened after the war, but had to be a Hitler first, to bring a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  So, before the war you felt strongly about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Right, about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> , yes, definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Now, you had a large German community. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">What did you know about Hitler and Nazism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> proper at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Ah, we, we watched that. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And in 1933, when Hitler was first legally voted and became the chancellor and he made the -- he burned the Reichstag and the [authors] and the books, so we were very well informed what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We couldn't imagine what a magnitude and what it's going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">A lot of people who had a lot of money could make plans and go elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The <span class="DLF">border</span> 's open if you have a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But if you're middle income people and you have no, you live, maybe you have some savings, you can't just afford to escape, even before the war, some years before you can even plan about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I remember one incident and that lasts for me forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by myself and came at the <span class="DLF">door</span> a vendor. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He was a German, and he wanted to sell me something. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I didn't have no idea and nothing on my mother wanted it, I said I'm sorry, I just don't need anything, nobody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I won't buy anything from you, and thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And you know what he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He told me I, this with angry and with such a hate, he told me now wait until Hitler will come and you see what happen to you Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Did you take that threat seriously?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  You know, it made a, because it happened and because of the outcome, I've never forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">That's why so many years -- That was maybe two years before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, you know how the Germans were very, and a lot of Poles collaborated with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  At the time '38, '39, were you finished with <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Were you working? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">What were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  I was going part time to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> had to offer, it was called Wszechnica(ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="109">That was like free <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I always took classes in art. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I was interested in fashion design and always wanted to paint. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I never had time. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I was designing clothes and I was taking courses in fashion design. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I was very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">What other people took in two years, I made in one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">01:14;30 The teacher that was there she said, there were some students that were with me in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , she said, well this one must be an apprentice somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Because how did she know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time you just didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learn a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You were sitting for a couple of years in a, with a dressmaker, a good one and you learned the trade that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Didn't get paid anything, beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That was apprenticeship. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So, she said, she must have been -- and there was one that went to me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she said no, no, we just graduated <span class="BUILDING">school</span> last year and she never went to, she wasn't apprentice, no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She couldn't understand; and you know what, I envy that teacher of mine, I remember her name, that I want to be once and do what she does. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And that realize, I was teaching the same way she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  How did all this change and when did it change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Well then, in 1939 the war came. </span><span class="sentence" id="126"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was not far from the <span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">By September 8, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was occupied without any opposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was no -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> it took them to take, six weeks it took them, until they take that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> they took without a shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So, the Germans came with a big parade with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> on top, and people, when the day would, people come, there was a, I remember, was like an exodus. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">People were, whatever they could, they put, you know, bundles and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Whoever had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in, had horse with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , whoever buy food; and people try escape the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">On that <span class="DLF">road</span> , so many people got killed because the Germans flew over their heads and they were throwing, you know, shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And the screaming was, like -- A lot of people never made the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> where they wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Some wanted to run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135"><span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> later on was no picnic either because what they did to one they escaped, they put them to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , sent them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So, and then they came in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We know the things, but we couldn't imagine what is waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Slowly they started to, with the Jewish star, with the thing, and then, by January 1940, they had, they chased all the Jewish population to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , an old dilapidated section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There was a round thing with barbed wire and little <span class="DLF">bridges</span> to pass for people to go out and in, <span class="DLF">overpasses</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> .</span></p>
