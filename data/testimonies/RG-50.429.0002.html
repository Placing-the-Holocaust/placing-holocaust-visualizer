<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  Well, I would think it was pretty much the latter, pretty much the latter. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Cause we’d had some background on what was going on prior to the games, and of course it was brought out more pointedly after the games. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">See when after the games were over then Hitler continued with his program, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Marching on <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and starting, starting the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And of course it was something that uh we more or less expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We more or less expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">You know uh the world didn’t think Hitler was doing what he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">You see they should have known what he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was part of the League of Nations, like all the <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> were, were part of that League. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And the, the reason that they set that league up as you know from history was to more or less keep a tab on each <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> in terms of them building up war armaments to start a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Now Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">They should have known then what he was going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But they didn’t believe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">They didn’t believe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They didn’t believe what he had printed in that book, Mein Kampf. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , called him the little Corporal. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">They down played Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">They didn’t believe, believe what he was about to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So therefore they, they didn’t put a curb on him see. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They probably could have stopped World War II if they had done so at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">When he withdrew from the League of Nations, if they’d of put a clamp, put a clamp on him at that 23 24 particular time, there probably would have been no World War hh. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">But they didn’t do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  Well in retrospect, based, based on all the training that the athletes had gone through in preparing for the Olympic games, I feel, I felt that they should have had, they should have gone on with the Olympics as they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Because I think that would, that would have been a very bad thing to have taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Uh but it would been, it would have been very hurting for the athletes who had made so much preparation, who had trained so long over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Fortunately for me I didn’t train like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I was more or less a gifted athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I came up very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But there was other athletes who had trained for the Olympics who had trained for years to prepare for the games, and that would have been very, very bad if they could not have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">That’s my, that’s my feeling, personal feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Now there might, there might be others who felt who would feel differently about it based on the question you just posed to me, but that’s my feeling.</span></p>
