<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Well, our first <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that I recollect, which was a very tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , on Nilefke (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We lived over there for awhile until my mother gave birth to my sister and I guess the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> became too small and we moved to <span class="BUILDING">Moronovska 2</span> (?), </span><span class="sentence" id="24">and 1 we lived there even while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started to be built. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The <span class="DLF">Wall</span> , which happened to have been on the corner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Very small <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , but they were like two small <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and another little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where my parents worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">They used to do ladies lingerie, like piecework. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They used to bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every morning and work until late at night, and if they finished making the lingerie they would fold it up, put it in boxes and deliver them to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I suppose they paid them rather well. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Because from what I can recall now, that couldn’t have been a very cheap <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It was a brand new <span class="BUILDING">building</span> when we moved in, it was a <span class="BUILDING">corner building</span> , we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and everyone had a <span class="DLF">window</span> , so I remember it being a lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Was your father in business for himself or was he producing for <span class="BUILDING">retail outlets</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  It was together with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They worked together in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They had machines and I remember them working until late hours at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">You know putting out their certain quotas that they used to bring in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  So they would make lingerie which would then be brought to <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , which would then be sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  I don’t think that they brought it to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> themselves, they brought it back to the people who gave them the pre-cut pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They just put them together, folded them up and put them in the boxes and delivered them back to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I suppose a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and they, on the other hand, would sell it to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> who sold it to clients.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  How would you describe the religious life of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  We were not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I remember Polish and Yiddish being spoken in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I don’t even remember, too well, observing any of the holidays too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I do not recollect any specifics except for some minute little things, I guess it must have been maybe like Chanukah I would receive some gifts and I was told it was a Jewish holiday, and I was told also there was a holiday, of course now I realize it was Passover, where we couldn’t eat bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But, I didn’t remember it too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I remember eating something else beside bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So this is all I have a recollection of actual holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Both of your parents were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  So you would describe them as secular? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">2
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Jewish but secular.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Were both of your parents born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My father was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , my mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovrin</span> (?), </span><span class="sentence" id="58">in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  What were their names, your parents’ names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  My mother was always called Toby. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I guess in every language it’s still Toby. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My father was called, my mother had a name for him Srulik (?), </span><span class="sentence" id="63">she used to call him. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">His Jewish name was <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I remember this mostly as Srulik I remember my mother calling his names. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">That’s why this name was more outstanding than whatever else other people called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And his sisters in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> also when they talked about him it’s always Srulik. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">That’s how he was known. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I guess it’s an abbreviation of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  What kinds of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you attend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  I did not go to any <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I never had a chance to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because the war broke out, but my father gave me some education. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We used to sit, he used to teach me how to read and write and I used to have to spend a certain amount of time everyday looking, if it was an old book, or if 1t was just a page from something, whatever was readable material he made sure that I know how to read and write.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  You didn’t understand Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  I did not know a word of Yiddish until I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and my mother made me learn Yiddish because it was the only way she could correspond with me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">She did not allow me to speak Polish in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She did not know too well English, which I caught on within one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I spoke English when I came here, and for her it was more difficult and she used to speak Yiddish most of the 3 time to all her friends and I guess in no time I learned the language and she would talk to me in Yiddish and I would answer back in English or half Polish until after awhile I learned the language well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Did you know your grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  My mother’s father, he came once, I remember seeing him once. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was a tall man with a beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It must have been a special occasion and I think I wasn’t more maybe than three or four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It must have been my mother’s sister’s wedding when I saw him, was the only time I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My grandmother died after she gave birth to my mother’s youngest brother, and my father’s side, I don’t remember a grandfather at all, but I do remember a grandmother, my father’s mother living around the corner from us when we lived on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moronovska</span> (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It was walking distance, but the woman was paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">She lived there with my father’s oldest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">His name was Shlamik (?), </span><span class="sentence" id="93">and she was in the last <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I remember my father said every week we have to go and see grandma. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So that’s , I remember just seeing her being ill in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">She probably must have had polio, I imagine.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  I don’t remember, but I did not understand certain languages that he spoke, but as you can see he wrote German on the photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I suppose he must have known more than two or three languages that I probably did not understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I only spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">That was the only language I knew and everything else sounded like clatter to me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Trying to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We were very busy hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , getting food together, trying to sell off things and to buy maybe flour, maybe an apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Whatever was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Of course a lot of Poles were coming in to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">There were <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , there were businesses and they would still be coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They would smuggle in things, a lot of Jews would buy things off them and give away a lot of precious things. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They would give away art, they would give away jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They would give away whatever was precious for the slightest piece of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Do you remember when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was first set up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and on the corner of that particular <span class="BUILDING">building</span> the <span class="DLF">wall</span> had started, so I was watching the bricks going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Men were working over there, which I didn’t understand at first why they’re closing off. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">In other words our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was on the inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was the last <span class="BUILDING">building</span> by the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I remember that and I remember them putting, the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was so high, 1t seemed so high to me, they were putting broken glass, I remember the smashing of bottles and glass putting on the top of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Do you remember how long it took for them to build the <span class="DLF">wall</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  It did not take long at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It seemed it grew by a foot or two or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  Do you remember who was doing the construction work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  I didn’t know who. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I saw men working. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I don’t know if they were Poles or Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I don’t know, but I saw men working and the Germans watching.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Not soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  They were German soldiers watching, standing with guns and civilians were working, and I don’t know who they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Do you remember when this <span class="DLF">wall</span> was built?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  The date? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I cannot give you a date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  The time of the year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  I guess it was all the same time, the very beginning, during the bombing and that’s when the <span class="DLF">wall</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They must have decided right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The bombs will stop, you know, start building the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">8
QUESTION:  So you continued to live in your old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Yes, we stayed in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Did anyone move into your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Do you remember any other changes following the building of this <span class="DLF">wall</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">For example, when you went out in public were there any changes in the way you went out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Well, you did not go out in public. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">You were afraid to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">You never knew when the Germans would come through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and attack and capture people. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And a lot of people were captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I remember seeing children dying and begging for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I also remember my father taking me to a woman who myself and four other little girls we used to be taught how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So he used to take us, maybe once or twice a week, in the evening, walk over and take another little girl, I don’t know who she was, maybe she was a neighbor, and take us to this woman who used to teach us how to read and write for about, this went on for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I would say I was being taught to read and write for the first six months maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And even that stopped because I was beaten up once in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I was wearing a little jacket and somebody wanted my jacket so they ripped my jacket off and they hit me and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> bleeding and this was the end of my education, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Or the beginning of a new education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">You don’t go out anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Because at that time even there were hours, there were times you knew when you were safe to go out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And she was only like maybe about a block away, I remember it was only about a five minute walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So that’s the reason why my father would take me or pick me up or I would walk back. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And that was the end of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  This was inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after the <span class="DLF">wall</span> had been built?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yes, inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Do you know who attacked you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  I don’t remember the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I know I remember somebody hitting me and ripping off my jacket and I had something in my hand, maybe it was a little briefcase or something was grabbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Maybe somebody who was starving, maybe he thought I had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Maybe his child was cold and he needed a jacket or something so he took it off me. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">9
QUESTION:  So he got it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  So he got it, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  He was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Yes, it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You saw a lot of these things happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You were afraid to carry something. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">If you had something to carry, you usually carried it inside your coat so nobody would detect it, or else you were attacked by other people if they suspect you have food on you, they’d do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I guess when your stomach is growling and you’re starving you know no honor, you know no shame, you know nothing, you just know one thing, you have to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  The few times that you did go out with your father, for that matter, did you wear any kind of armband or star or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I did not have to wear anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">After that incident I was never allowed anymore to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Do you remember whether your parents wore Jewish armbands?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Yes, when my father went out he put on the armband and the minute he entered the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , he would take it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Just in case somebody spots him, he had to wear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  How about your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  I don’t remember my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I guess she must have worn it also. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I don’t remember her putting it on or taking it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Maybe she did it <span class="NPIP">outside</span> when she left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was something you did not wear with pride, so like you didn’t want even your own children to see this so no questions would be asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But I saw people wearing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I didn’t ask because I think I knew what the answer was going to be so I didn’t ask too many questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I was very silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  I saw a photograph of your mother during these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">She looked like a very glamorous as well as a very lovely woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  Oh yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Did she go out a lot in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  Well the only time it was when they closed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and as I said the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> still continued and she got a job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">A very prestigious job. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But this took a while until she went out on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> and she was in contact with the other Poles about papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">She got alien papers that she was not Polish, she was 10 Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Those were the papers she was given and her name was Ana Gregorief (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I will never forget that because she spoke Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">She did not come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> so her Polish had a very bad accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And, therefore, to make sure she is not questioned about being Jewish, she became Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Then it’s OK to have an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So she became Ana Gregorief and paid a fortune for these papers and as Ana Gregorief she got the job in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so she could go in and go out and she would bring in food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  So she worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but she was living outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  She had to go in and she had to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">She could go in and go out, she had a special passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was like going around the clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">This was not a nine to five job. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They were in a rush to make these uniforms or whatever they were doing over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  So she was making uniforms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Yes, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they were making uniforms, maybe they were making other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">She never discussed what they were doing there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  You don’t remember the name of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  No, but I remember her once, she came in, but this was a long time, much later, 1943 already when she brought in a suitcase into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there were uniforms on the top and when she picked up the uniforms I remember seeing guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Long shotguns and boxes I guess must have been bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">She was bringing it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> because they were talking about an uprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  So your mother smuggled guns into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  Yes, she smuggled in several times, and of course she carried the suitcase as if it weighed only twenty pounds and it could have weighed over a hundred pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That’s how she got all dressed up so people would never dare, or the Germans never dared to question her. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">She would just show them the flashed Ana Gregorian, her name, her special pass that she could go in and go out and that’s how she got away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Does the name Tobins mean anything to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  I don’t remember any names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  I know there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> making uniforms it was known as the <span class="BUILDING">Tobins Factory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  I never saw the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The only time I ever saw was the time she brought the suitcase when she brought once. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I said what are these uniforms and she said these belong to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">That’s all I remember her saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I don’t know if this was 11 the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I don’t even know where she worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">There was no conversation, there was nothing was talked about so my sister and I could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">My father and mother when they talked nobody else could hear a word they were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">She didn’t want us to know anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  She slept though in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">She would go in, she would go out she would like to go back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">She had the permission to go back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  She would also bring food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  She also brought food. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So we had food and nobody bothered her. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Because nobody after awhile knew who she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">As people were dying out and, of course the crowds in the very beginning were all gone already and there were very few people now in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and those that survived already at that point were hidden in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> or in <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> trying to scrounge food, together mainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was getting smaller at that point, we had moved several times already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  So you were forced to move out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, we were forced out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they said we have to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">My mother at that time would say, we’re going to move to a much nicer <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">She still tried to protect us that we should not know what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We were like in the blind in a way because she never wanted to reveal to us what was going on at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But I remember moving and then again moving and then again moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We were constantly on the go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  Were these nicer <span class="NPIP">places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  No, they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They were just <span class="INT_SPACE">temporary quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We would walk into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we would be the only ones in an entire <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We could take any <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so we would run to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was not bombed and there were empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Every <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> we looked in all over, we looked for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">There was nothing there and we just slept anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  What kind of food would your mother bring you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  She would bring maybe a potato, she would bring flour, some kind of a vegetable, a lot of fruit, a piece of bread, a piece of salami once she brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It was scrounged together, I guess, like leftovers they looked like more. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">It was not like you went to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and you bought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">She would ask the workers maybe they had leftovers from lunch, whatever it was, those were the leftovers she would buy it from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  Before the time of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , were you considered a picky eater? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">12
ANSWER:  I was a picky eater, yes I was a very picky eater.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  These are not the things she would have ordinarily given you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  How about your father, did he get any jobs during this period? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Was he working at any <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He was watching my sister and me while my mother was the one looking very Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Because as you can see on the photograph she did not resemble a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">That’s the reason why she got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So she would get dressed up, she bought herself a coat, a hat to make sure she looked as elegant as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Because if you look ragged you know, you would have been stopped right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Like this if you walked with your head up high and very positive nobody bothered you. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I guess your attitude was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">That’s why she survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  Your father stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and watched the kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Well, he was watching us and he also kept an eye on his mother, his relatives, we were still in contact in the beginning, we’re still in contact with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  They also lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  In the original <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> got smaller, my grandmother must have died because I never heard about her again or maybe she was shot, I don’t know, and neither were her uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Like nobody had remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It was just my father, my mother and the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We were kept on the move. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And then after awhile we found out that one of his brothers was nearby when my mother said would try to find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">She’ll go into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and would try to find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We found her, we found only my father’s sister-in-law, my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">She had given birth to a baby at that ttme. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">She was there with an infant. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">The infant was crying and we heard like an echo, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was so empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We heard the echo and we heard German voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">We heard shotguns and we saw my aunt was thrown out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">She was on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and the baby was ripped in half was also on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Crying and then a silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And if somebody marched blocks away you could hear the footsteps. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Especially German footsteps. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">You could hear <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">It was a dead silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Nobody even breathed so you are not discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">At that time you are already hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we were there were quite a few people with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I would say about twenty people were together and this is when the conversation started with the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And then other people came and we were all like together in this one particular <span class="REGION">area</span> and they started talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You know, there were very few of us left, that something should be done and this is where my mother started bringing in the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Whatever should be done and this is when my mother began bringing in the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Whatever we need to do, she said, first we need to shoot our way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Were you afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I was very afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I didn’t know what the next hour was going to bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">If we will be discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">My biggest fear was if someone will put a gun against my head and shoot, because I’ve seen so may to others and it looks so terrifying, this was my biggest fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It was bigger than starvation even.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  So you saw people who were shot.</span></p>

QUESTION:  How long did you live with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  Oh, for a few months, I would say, quite a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">At that point already, I realized that my mother and my father are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I didn’t realize, of course, that my father was captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Right during the uprising he was captured taking , my mother, of course, head out. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">She was still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for quite some time and the way she got out is a whole story by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It was very miraculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">At that time she did not look so elegant, she did not look so glamorous as she did just a couple of months before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">She was hungry, she was tired, she lost a husband in that time and she changed tremendously and the few people that did survive were in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> for quite some time and then when they got on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , that’s the reason why it took such a time, until she finally one evening just knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and came to the Doblinkov family and when I saw her, to me it was like a new world had opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I never believed I’d ever see her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">16

<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  The very beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  The very beginning of the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">20
QUESTION:  Did you ever find out later what your mother was doing during the uprising?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  What she did during the uprising? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I guess she was fighting like the handful of people that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">They were fighting until there were very few people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">She said it was a glorious fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">It was glorious. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So they gave her a reason to live again. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">There was a thread of hope, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They knew they cannot do very much but just to give the Germans something back. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">A little revenge for all the aches and pains they caused everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  Did she ever describe how she got out? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">how this Ukrainian factory woman who became a Jewish fighter how then she survived and got out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then found you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Oh, this was through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> , this took time, this took time, until she finally got out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">They could not escape, they put the gas in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> , they made sure that nobody can escape, there were dogs all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">They had to be at a <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> for quite some time until they could get out from wherever they were hiding until it became clearer that she could get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But this took awhile, because they were on the lookout. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They knew that whoever survived this uprising would want to escape because there was nothing else left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">It was a handful of heroic people and they’re not ready to give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So even the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> you couldn’t go, it was all gas there. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They would have gotten poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So they had to wait probably until it was o.k. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">to find a way to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  Did your mother survive and escape by herself or was she with others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  No, I think they could not go in groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Everybody went their own way, because in a group it is more dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Singularly it always easier to escape when a single person runs. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I don’t know, maybe they started as a group and they wound up individually, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">She never talked about that particular incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It was a very painful incident in her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And even though she used to talk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , at one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I were gone and my father was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">It seems like the Germans came, they were coming and they said we’re going to put the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on fire whoever’s there doesn’t run away or doesn’t give themselves up they’re going to get burned alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So I don’t know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my father, where was my father, I’m trying to think, he was also gone in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He did not go to work, but my mother went to work and he went someplace and my sister and I were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And when the Germans came, we looked at each other, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So, we went downstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> we found there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> there to go to the next <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the next <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , so we escaped through a few other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">They were also empty, so we didn’t know what had happened to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we were originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I don’t know if they put it on fire or they didn’t put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another 21 <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the first thing we started doing is running from <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was all abandoned and there was no food nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We turned quietly every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and every <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , we looked all over and then we hear Germans marching downstairs and they’re entering the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and here’s my sister and I alone in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and it’s all empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I remember I took her and I put her inside a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen cabinet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I pushed her inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen cabinet</span> and I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> and I hid behind a chest that stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I squished in the back of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in they’ ll think there are rags there. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I took a blanket and covered myself and the two of us stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We heard the German footsteps and we heard them getting closer and closer and then they kicked open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they marched in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">They must have been looking for Jews from <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">This was their preoccupation and that’s how I know this, and they walked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They were shooting in every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I guess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I heard them talking loud and clear I didn’t understand what they were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Then I heard them walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And when they walked out and they left the <span class="DLF">door</span> , my first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister’s name, are you alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="733">She says Yes, are you alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So we got together again, she came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> and we decided we’re going to hide in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">From now on it was no good in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because they are shooting and they may shoot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So we’ll go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We go all the way up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and there’s a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and we hear voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were people hidden in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">We started moving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> away and the people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> didn’t know what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let us in, let us in, we got to hide with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So my sister said, well, I’m going to cry so loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I’m going to tell them that you’re hiding there, so let us in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">We came in over there, we sat with them, they had water, so we drank a little water with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  Did you know who these people were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">We just walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">There were about three or four people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">It looked like older people, maybe at that time, maybe they were in their 40’s, 50’s, 60’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I don’t know I couldn’t even judge the age. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">We stayed with them for a few days and then we left them, and we were going from <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , we got to find our parents, where are our parents, we had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And from one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> we saw there were schlep carts and we saw people gathering and the two of us would look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , you know hidden behind the curtain, to make sure we don’t see our mother or our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I didn’t know what to look for. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I didn’t see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So, I said, you see they did not get caught, they didn’t get caught they must be someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Don’t you think my mother came around. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">She 22 walked also from <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to <span class="BUILDING">building</span> yelling quietly, Frania, Chaja, just like an echo from the distance it sounded like. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So she found us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  She found you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  And my father must have gone to work also that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">My mother went to work, my father went also to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Maybe to look for food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">QUESTION:  So your father worked sometimes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">ANSWER:  Like sometimes, depending. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were always very busy, they were always doing something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  What would your father do whenever he found some work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  I guess whatever labor they gave you. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">They didn’t ask you what your talents were. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">They needed somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I guess like today, you know, people want a job, whatever they’ll tell them to do they’ll do, so there was no question of asking what your talents are or what you specialize, I’ll do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  This episode that you just described, this flashback, this was before the ghetto uprising, long before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Not long before. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">This was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">This was when we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , when we were staying there for awhile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">QUESTION:  This wasn’t the Morenovska (’?)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  No, the Morenovska, we were gone already. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">This was like the third or the fourth <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> already, that we were on the go. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So we were like constantly like gypsies on the go running. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">The minute we were afraid maybe they heard footsteps, we would leave the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">We were afraid to stay in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> three or four nights that’s it and you had to be on the move.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  And that’s the way it was until they took you to the <span class="BUILDING">Doblenkov house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">This was up until, I would say, the last few weeks before we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Doblenkov’s</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Then we were like more settled with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">All of a sudden I saw a lot of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I don’t remember their faces, but I remember there were quite a few people there and they were talking constantly and making plans and they would tell us, there were a few children, go sit on the side, go away, not to bother anybody, and they were making their plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So we were there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Once they made up, I guess, a date when they’re going to start this. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">This is when my mother made up her mind to get me and my sister, to get us on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> so we’re not going to get caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">23

<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  We started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Most of the time we were hiding out during the day and we were on foot at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> all on foot and we stopped at different, and I remember my mother saying, if we’re going to walk in this direction another twenty kilometers there’s a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I know some people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">We’ll go there and when we made it over there, we stayed with them, I think for about two nights, and we heard the Germans <span class="NPIP">outside</span> so we ran out to the back, the three of us escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And we were on the run continuously on the run until I don’t know for how long on foot until we came to this primitive little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where only <span class="DLF">farms</span> , like small little straw roof type of little <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">People lived like that and we were all very ragged, and my mother marched into these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , claiming some kind of accident, something happened and we needed refuge for just a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And when they asked us where we come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We said we come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="856">She said, oh, she heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , can you tell 25 us stories about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">She says if you let me sleep here, I'll tell you all the stories you want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">They heard about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> going on electric. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">This was all primitive, and when I think back, my G-d like a few hundred years behind times.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="962">QUESTION:  But they wouldn’t know one even if they were under their own <span class="DLF">roof</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">They never saw one. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">They only know from what they heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Don’t forget, the war was on for quite a few years already at that point and they knew nothing of what was going on in the outside their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
