<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good afternoon, Dora.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  It’s nice to see you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  It’s nice to see you, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Dora, what was your name at birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Teodora Basch. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Teodora Rachela Basch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Teodora — T-e-o or T-h?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  T-e-o. It got changed much later on when I got American citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Once I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I got tired of telling everybody that my name was just like Theodora, but without the “h”. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So, when I got my citizenship, and was asked if I would like to change anything in my name, I said, “Yes, please give me an ‘h’.” [</span><span class="sentence" id="11">Laughs.] </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So, that’s how, but I did not change-
QUESTION:  So, that’s how the “h” came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  That’s how the “h” came. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">The Rachela part I kept as 1s, even though, of course, it’s Rachel, but it wasn’t important to change, and since I mostly just use my initials, so I didn’t change that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And your name now is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  My name now is Theodora Rachela Klayman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  But you use Dora.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  I have had a variety of nicknames. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I use Dora. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I noticed that in the pictures during my childhood, that sometimes there is a photograph when I was like six months old that was sent by my mother to my grandparents, and it says, “Tea’’. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, at one point, I had the nickname Tea from Thea, but I don’t remember being called that. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Then, in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , Dora is arather sort of, a name, a very folksy name used usually sort of used for old ladies, and that’s not what I was ever called. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was called “Dorica” as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So, if we go back now, I’m still called Dorica, and at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I often was also called “Dorek’’, and when I came here, I became “Dora’’, and that’s how it’s — it’s sticking to that one now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  So, no one here calls you Dorica?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  No, no, just my — my Croatian — well, Lucie sometimes does.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Do you like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  It’s very — it’s sort of very — it’s — its, diminutive names are used a lot in all <span class="REGION">Slavic countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So, it’s very normal for someone from a <span class="REGION">Slavic country</span> to use that, but it’s really not — it sounds very strange, I think, in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I know a young woman who lives here who’s from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> , and she’s called Bekica, and it’s Becky, and to me it’s like sounds very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It’s sort of like, you know, Dolly or something like that, and you don’t use those names very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  When were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  January 31, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  And, you were born-
ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I checked that about two years after my parents were married, and I lived there only the first two and a half, three years of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My mother was not originally <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My father’s family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , and that not for a very long time in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I mean, they came, I think, when my father was already in his early teens or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They came mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They were not however <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sefardi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They had come there from, I think, elsewhere in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And then came to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , and my father’s family tended to be cantors. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They were very — it was a very religious family, and they studied cantorial music and one of them, one of my uncles, Arnold, was actually a cantor and had studied very seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Another uncle, Joseph, also studied seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My father, I think, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , to another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to — also to be a cantor at times, and met my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So, my mother’s family was from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> ; it’s further north from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> on the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> , really very close to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , but that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in contrast to others, did not have a Hungarian population. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I never learned Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My mother apparently did. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My grandfather on my mother’s side was the rabbi of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There were some 30 plus Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I think about, according to some books that I’ve seen, about 37 Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And my grandfather, I believe, was invited to come and be a rabbi there, and they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and he — he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> already with his — with the family, and so I don’t know exactly how old he was, but from what I gather, most of his writing, he did quite a bit of writing, published, was in German, though he did learn Croatian, spoke in Croatian, but I think all of his writing is in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I have papers where he wrote by hand and you can see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Though his publications are in Croatian — I have some of the stuff that he published mostly treaties on the Torah and so on, so I don’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I’ve only been told all these things, and I don’t know really if he wrote in German and someone translated, or whether he wrote directly in Croatian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  What was your father’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  My father’s name is Salamon — Shlomo, Salamon, and my mother’s name was Silva, which is Silvia, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  And her maiden name was Deutsch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Deutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So, my grandfather, my maternal grandfather was Leopold Deutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My grandmother was Katarina, and they had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I’m sorry, they had three daughters and a son, four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The oldest — the oldest daughter was Giza, then Blanka, and then Silva, and the son was Erne.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  And Giza plays an important role in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Giza plays an important role in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The family lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Giza was ten years, I’m sorry, fifteen years older than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So, she often was sort of active as my mother’s mother in they — I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seashore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters — Zdenka and Vera. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Their name was Appler, and the youngest — the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cakovec</span> which is another small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , much larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> actually than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , much closer even to the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> , and she went there to a teacher’s — a <span class="BUILDING">teacher’s school</span> , became an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , opened a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and that’s — and that’s where they had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">Ludbreg Bank</span> , and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Ljudevit is actually his real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Ill get back to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The brother Erne worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , worked early in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , and I’m not exactly sure what he did there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I think clerical work of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I’m not sure of what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And the — my mother eventually finished the <span class="BUILDING">teacher’s school</span> and worked as a teacher in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> for a short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Then my father and she met and married and left to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , and that’s how I happened to have been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  So, let me ask you something, you were a very, very young child when the war came in 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  So, what I need you to try to do is to distinguish what you’ve learned from other people and what you actually remember, because you were so little. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So, 1f you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So, this is what my first question is for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">What is your — do you have any memories before 1941, before you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Images.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Images?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it’s very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And so it’s very difficult because I’ve seen those pictures all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It’s very difficult to really distinguish what’s memory and what’s a photograph that you have in your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can’t really tell you whether I do or don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I think I have an image of myself leaving on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , because I left apparently when I was three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> with friends of my grandparents and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And, again, I don’t have any idea whether — because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what’s going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already — my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I — whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I have no — no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don’t remember being tearful or I don’t remember the farewell. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I don’t remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I don’t remember any farewells. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I remember sort of being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there being fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  It was fun?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Was that the first time you were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Oh, I think so, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It’s very hard to tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Do you remember the birth of your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  You don’t remember him as this tiny little baby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I mean, I remember him, however, when I do remember him very well is when he was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That I really do remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  So, were you told about your mother going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because clearly you were too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Your mother wouldn’t have explained to you that she was a teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  No, none of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I’m just saying the background of what really — of what this family was all about, who was who. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I have not the foggiest. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">No, of course not, because all of that happened before I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  What did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  My father had apparently learned the trade of brushmaking, and had opened a workshop to make brushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">From what I am told by his surviving brother, he was very good at it, and by the time that I was born, I can tell from, again, from the pictures of him, what people told me, there was a small workshop with, I don’t know, ten or so workmen, and there was machinery and they made brushes and was very successful at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But, I, again, don’t have any memory of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I only know pictures and stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Is this difficult for you as an adult person thinking about who were these parents and what you have are paper pictures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  It’s not actually that difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The reason for it is that it was not a new discovery that I made as an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, 1t would have been difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But I grew up with all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It’s — it’s just part and parcel of my growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I always heard stories and always knew who I was and I always had these pictures so that, you know, it’s, you know, you just to grow up with stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">That’s all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  So, you go to Ludberg-
ANSWER:  Ludbreg, which actually has a meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The word “lud” in Croatian means crazy or mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">This is kind of crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And “breg’’, I think, means a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , but it also could be the words got transposed and it was “berg” which means <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Nobody ever explained why this 1s called that, but it’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Do you have a first memory of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Remember arriving? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You don’t remember -
ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember arriving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  With your grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  I remember very well being with my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That I do remember, and again, I have certain images like I remember sitting with my grandfather in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and playing at his feet, and he was paralyzed already on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> because he had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And he was trying to pick up the toys that I was playing with, something like that, and he fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was a traumatic experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So, I remember that, and I remember Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I remember the-
QUESTION:  What happened after he fell?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Oh, someone came — he couldn’t pick himself up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  You just--
ANSWER:  I just remember that I was guilty of throwing the toys around or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, I remember being upset and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, that’s why I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I remember Hanukkah for example, but not the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I remember candles and I remember getting an orange, which was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Oranges were not to be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I remember at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> , or before Pesach. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that’s apparently what can be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I found that much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I had no idea of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I remember my grandfather sitting in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> with all of us playing around and he used to — he used to have his little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">This was, mind you, we were living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was attached to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and it was also — and everything — all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So, there was also the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It’s been destroyed now, but — so, he would sit in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> with the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn’t do that, but — that’s Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little piles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  They, as far as you knew, they were specifically for these particular people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, there was specific people. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">There was a specific beggar that used to come to our — to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I lived much, much later and he would come every Wednesday and would always get alms, and I remember seeing him later on on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and being like a normal person, you know” It was very strange, but they were characters. </span><span class="sentence" id="173"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> ’s a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and especially was, and everybody sort of knew everybody and there were all these sort of different routines that were going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Since you said there were about 30 families who lived here, how much larger was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">A couple of hundred families?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Yes, and all of these families did not live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> proper, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Some of them were in surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> is sort of like the county seat, and there were many surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> did not have either their own Jewish anything, nor did they have even <span class="BUILDING">middle schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">For example, later on when I went to <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , people, kids from those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> would come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and that was also the place where <span class="BUILDING">market</span> that was happening, and any kind of official papers were held and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So, it was sort of a — basically like a county seat. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, anyway, back to the images of my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Those are the images that I have my grandparents, but of course-
QUESTION:  You only mentioned -
ANSWER:  My grandfather — yes, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I remember my grandmother less. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I think I remember her more from pictures than I remember anything that went on in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , strangely enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">No meals, no nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  No playing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  I don’t remember that, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Peeling potatoes or something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember any of that.</span></p>

QUESTION:  You’re there probably the end of March-
ANSWER:  I’m there visiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The next memory I have in my grandparents’ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I remember one evening, being lots of commotion, lots of unhappiness, and then, lo and behold, there arrives a baby, and that — a child, a young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">That was my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I remember his arrival because he looked very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He had lines, like brown lines on his face, and I thought, ““What’s with the brown lines?” </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I know now that basically he was crying and there was dirt on the <span class="DLF">road</span> until they washed him up and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I know now what had happened, but I don’t have a memory of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I only know what happened.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What were you told? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Your grandparents told you or do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  I was constantly surrounded by this extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, there was my grand — there were my grandparents and then only about two blocks away lived the middle sister, my mother’s middle sister of the three sisters, Blanka with her husband and two of my cousins Vera and Zdenka, and then there was also Giza, who by that time was also married, and her husband Ludva, the Vrancic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So, there was constant comings and goings, so that I don’t know who said what, and in fact, I remember that evening in particular when my brother arrived, and then I remember also being sort of distracted later on the next day by my two cousins who took me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I spent much time with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So, I was just sort of floating between these families. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I don’t remember being particularly rooted in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But, anyway, the reason — what happened with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">That must have after the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , April ’41. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">My parents were apparently almost immediately taken into <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , led and my mother had my brother with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We had — I don’t know if it was a housekeeper or somebody who lived nearby, a non-Jewish woman, and she went and was able to get my brother out. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So, he was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> with my parents for a very short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Then she got him out, and she must have phoned Ludbreg, I mean, I know she did because I went through that story before, and they immediately — the oldest sister, Giza and her husband who was not Jewish, Ludva Vrancic, they went immediately to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> and they got my brother, and they brought him back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And that’s — that’s what happened that night, and that’s — they brought him and he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He was nine months old at that time, and so he was crying and carrying on, and that’s about what I remember of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I remember everybody being nervous and upset and-

<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  No, if they did, I don’t remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They may have, but I don’t remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I remember, you know, lots of conversations and things and commotions and then just going off with my cousins to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I remember being, at one point, that they were pulling me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So, it must have been winter time by then, and so it must have been later. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I don’t know when. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But, I remember being on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> and their telling me something about a war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  So, if your brother was nine months old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  So, that must have been later than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Yeah, that image of being on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> must have been later.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Mm-hmm, which 1s very likely that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> there might be snow already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  September, October?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Not September, October, but by November there might be snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Some snow -— so, it might not have been all at the same time, that I have that image from. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It’s just like the images are often not connected. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They kind of live in my head, but they’re not necessarily — the chronological order is off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Of course, I understand, but is that your first recollection of seeing your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, it is, and then we were together from then on. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We were always together from then on until his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Were you glad he was there? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Or did it take something away from you when he came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  When he came, I don’t know whether I paid that much attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Eventually, it was kind of nice having him around sometimes, but sometimes I was — with time, as he got to be bigger, he played a large role in everybody’s life. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He was very cute and very smart and I was often very jealous, especially later on, he got to be — he was very personable and both of us were very redhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">This is very muted now. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I mean, I was flaming red and so was he, and he was very cute and he had a very good memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He’d memorize very long poems, and he would stand up and recite them, and I was like, “Ugh, there he goes again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very fond of him, and he — he somehow acquired a nickname “Lovrek” which wasn’t his name, and everybody thought it was his name, but it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  What does Lovrek mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  Nothing, I don’t know how that came about, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I have no idea how that came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zdrav</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  His name was Zdravko, which 1s very hard for you I’m sure to pronounce, but it’s actually means hime (ph), because zdravije is health. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Apparently, my — from what I was told, again, I was told that my mother wanted us to have very Croatian names. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">People were very, very much into being Croat, and Nationalists, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So, those two names were supposed to be, you know, real Croatian names. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We weren’t going to have such names as who knows what.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  So, Teodora is very Croat?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Dora, do you have your first recollection of the effect of a war or something, anything that has to do with this chaos that obviously encumbering <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Well, I — I have memories that have to do with what must have then been become a persecution, with the issuing of lists, et cetera, et cetera, and you know, historically we know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> and, they — people were being rounded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I was not aware of that as such, but I do remember people leaving and I remember being left behind, and I didn’t know exactly what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Perhaps, again, they told me, but I didn’t understand what they were telling me. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But, as I mentioned, my Aunt Blanka and her family lived next door to Aunt Giza and Ludjevit, and basically I remember at one point people coming and we were all in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they came with satchels or small suitcases in their hands and pillows under their arms and saying goodbye and leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I didn’t know exactly what was going on and why were they leaving and who was crying, and I was sad because these were my cousins, but that’s the image that I have in my head of their leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And I had the sense that it was, there was something that was dangerous and bad and that people were being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I don’t have the image of my grandparents leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I don’t remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I remember my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I know that my grandparents were taken at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  At the same time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Mm-hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Fairly early, they all left. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I also know that my cousins, I know that now, that my favorite cousins with whom I stayed quite a bit of time and the middle aunt, Blanka, the middle aunt and her husband, that they had left for awhile and went to the Italian part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that they were someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Her family, which was another family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> left also, and had left before this proclamation and they cleverly did not return. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan- held territory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kordun</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Is it possible that it was — there was a list, and people knew they were supposed to go so they didn’t have to be rounded up, they went, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  I think somebody must have come and gotten them and had the list, and I — I tried to reconstruct why I wasn’t taken, and I hadn’t thought about it before even toask my —__ with whom I eventually grew up, “Why wasn’t I taken ever?” </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Besides having been hidden here and there, which I know I was, because people would warn us that there would be a raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I have a feeling that I was not on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I had seen one of those lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">One of them is published in a book on Ludbreg, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, and my aunts are there, and everybody’s listed, and I’m not on the list, neither is my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I have a feeling that the must have gotten the list maybe from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> , and of course, I was not, since I was not born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> and I was not considered a, you know, a member of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , I was not on that list. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">That’s a possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I — if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Like sitting ducks. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Even I — I mean I didn’t have a choice, of course, I was a child — but I’m thinking, “Why in the world were we there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I recently, my aunt made a tape of her experiences-
QUESTION:  This is Magda?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  Magda, and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> this whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They stayed until the bitter end and they could barely escape at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I was like, “Why were you there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="311">You know, it’s very hard for me to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It’s not hard to understand why they didn’t — why in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, but I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , one of the things about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was very close to the — to where the Partisans where. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It’s at the foot of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and of course, it was very difficult and Partisans had a very difficult life, but for those of us who were so vulnerable, why we didn’t you go someplace into a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I mean, this was small, but it wasn’t really small, not by Croatian standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Why we stayed there, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Faith that we would not be wanted? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Or something? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don’t really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, we would — we would go places. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I remember one time going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span> , which 1s a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nearby, and staying with a relative, and I think this was the time that I understood that it was dangerous to stay and that we had to hide for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The other —all the other hiding that I did was sort of nearby with — mostly with friends, and there were a number of families. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">There was the Ziza, the Runjak family, my brother and I would spend some time with, especially <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> experienced a lot of fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We were really not so much in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> kind of situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We were in a war — we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So, when it was — when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , then I spent, for example, time with this Runjak family, and they had rented from this other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was now empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They had rented that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I called Mrs. Runjak “Mother” when I knew that it was dangerous, and I understood at that point what was dangerous, and my brother called her “Mother” all the time because he wouldn’t know how to distinguish from when it was dangerous and when it wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So, I lived with them, and they had three teenage children, and it’s thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustashe making <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , and we were there, and just pretending that we were part of this other family. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And it’s amazing sometimes because the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> essentially knew who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">That’s the most amazing part of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">In a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi’s grandchildren, and at no point did anybody say, “What about these kids?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  So, is there some way in which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 1s protecting you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  It wasn’t organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Yeah, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It wasn’t an organized kind of thing, but a lot of people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were really Partisan sympathizers, and I know a number of people who lost, who perished, who lost their lives as Partisans during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">People across the <span class="DLF">street</span> lost their one and only son. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So, I think -- unwittingly, I mean, not in an organized manner, but it just was not a kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that would — that would say, “Oh, well, go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Or, “You’re endangering us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I was endangering some of these people, and — but, they took us in anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So, but, anyway, our bad experiences during the war really had to do with the fighting, which everybody experienced, not just the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Just there was only brother and I and my aunt that were left at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Because there were fights especially at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">There would be terrible fights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  In the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  In the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Yeah, oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">There were — the <span class="DLF">street</span> that I lived on was after the war called, “The <span class="DLF">Street</span> of the 17 Udarna Brigada’. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I don’t know how to translate — Brigade is Brigada, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Udarna means — it’s striking, one who can strike well, particularly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And the reason it’s called that 1s because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was down my <span class="DLF">street</span> because they were totally surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn’t want to be captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But there were fights and we would spend — we spent a lot of time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , not a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in an American sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We had a vineyard, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And at one point, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> down there, rollaway <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and — not forget — I’m sorry, we didn’t know that we should go down there on time. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So, then if a fight — if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to get — to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and so it was too dangerous already to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Where would you stay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  We — yeah, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That I remember very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Sometimes the bullets were flying like crazy through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">There was one night, I won’t forget, where the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a two-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ours was a one-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they were shooting from our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">The bullets were flying through our <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and I was sleeping on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> in a corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So, if you can imagine a corner and then <span class="DLF">window-window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So, I was fairly well protected, but I was scared to death and I don’t have any recollection of where my brother, but my aunt and uncle were sleeping in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and for some strange reason, I think everybody was kind of paralyzed that no one left there, but there was a <span class="DLF">window</span> that was — that was right facing out from this <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and I remember crying and asking for somebody to come, and finally my uncle got up and came, and no sooner did he come to comfort me than a bullet landed on the pillow of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">He would’ve been killed if not for the fact that I had been crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But in the morning sometimes, you looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> — I remember one time it was a horrible battle, and we looked — in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> you have these — they’re not shades in our sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  Shutters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  No, not even shutters. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They’re more like our Venetian blinds, but they are on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they are wooden, and you pull them up like that, but so, you can also turn them so that you can kind of peer out. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I remember peering out, and that is a recollection I definitely have of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> going by our <span class="DLF">windows</span> full of dead — nude, dead bodies because they had collected them and then just stripped them of clothes and were taking them someplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  Were these horse drawn?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  Like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Did you see that often?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  No, not often. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I remember that one very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">We lived on a main — pretty much main <span class="DLF">street</span> on the corner of two very important main <span class="DLF">streets</span> so that when things went by, we saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And, also, often — well, as these bullets would come through, I mean, after the war, our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> were riddled with bullets, and the — we had these armoires and cabinets of books and they had bullet holes through them, and if you opened the tablecloths, it looked like a doily, you know, all full of beautifully separated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  If you couldn’t get into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , would you lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> so that you wouldn’t be by a <span class="DLF">window</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  Sometimes, yes, and we would sometimes also go into the side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that didn’t have <span class="DLF">windows</span> to the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">There was one side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , except that one night that I remember so well, when we stupidly stayed where we shouldn’t have stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I think sometimes it was so bad that nobody wanted to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But most of the time, -- most of the — it’s very — it’s horrible, I hate to say that, but I remember being quite exhilarated by it all at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I should have been — instead of being afraid, I used to think it was sort of very exciting to have these battles going on, and thinking it was quite great fun to sleep down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> where there were always some frogs jumping around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  Maybe as a child -
ANSWER:  As a child, it is so much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I mean, I’m sure the adults were totally, totally traumatized, but as a child, it’s very interesting looking back, and I’m looking now at my granddaughter who is now about the age that I was at the end of the war, and I’m thinking, “Can you imagine what something like that would do to her?” </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And, yet, when I think of myself at the time, I don’t think I was so horribly scared at many of the points. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I was more — I think there were some things that were just very scary, like seeing all these bodies going by. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And there was a time that — an image that I have very much in my head again, that was another thing that happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">There were — the Ustashe would take people who were thought to be sympathizers of the Partisans, which they were, many of them, and if they — sometimes they would catch them, some of them were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and that includes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually married my aunt and he wasn’t Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I didn’t explain that part, but at any rate, he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> at one point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> , and they would take them either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasn’t supposed to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">She was holding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">There was a body hanging on every one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> around the square, and I remember people saying — they were — because they were Partisans, that’s why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  Now, when you saw something like that, and you saw the dead body, was that different for you then when you were in the midst of this fighting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, that — because the fighting was sort of like a “Star War” kind of thing like a game, and I didn’t really — I don’t think I understood too well at the time what is the result of all this shooting, but I was scared to death when nobody was with me, and I cried a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So, there were times when I was very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But, we played war so much, you know, when I was a child, that’s the game we played. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You played — you played with, like I remember playing with dried corn stalks. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You would — you know when they were cut off? </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And they were supposed to be fed to the cows, and we use those to battle each other in play war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  And what kind of war was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Middle age war or contemporary war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  No, no, it was contemporary war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  So, you used guns?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  These were guns, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  And were you Germans and Croatians or what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  No, we were not Germans and Croatians. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We were Ustashe and Partisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Ah-ha!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  No, we didn’t have anything to do with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The Germans — I never saw a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">All during the war, I never saw a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We had our own Germans, our own Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  What <span class="NPIP">side</span> did you play on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Oh, well, you always wanted to be the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Somebody had to lose, and somebody had to win.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  And did the Partisans win all the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  In our games, yes, in our games, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  And how did the games work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Well...
QUESTION:  Did you go “bang-bang, you’re dead” or what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  Yeah, and the boys would usually take the upper hand and the girls would lose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  Was it girls against boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Sometimes, sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">There was an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> which belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and it was — they just started building it, but they never finished building it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So, it was sort of empty, and you could hide <span class="NPIP">inside</span> there, and that’s where we often played our games, and also in our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> we had sort of a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It was built rather than a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was sort of attached to the structure, and in that <span class="BUILDING">structure</span> we had a press for pressing grapes to get wine, and that was otherwise pretty empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">That was also a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to play.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Now, this is not your grandfather’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  This is the neighbor’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  No, no, that belonged to the Vrancic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">The Vrancic family had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was built by my uncle’s father, and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> when he was — when that father was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So, it was in the mid-1800s. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They were well educated and very old Croatian family. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They count their ancestors to something like the 12" century where there were two famous Vrancic people. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">There was the Cardinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother’s family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobility, nevertheless, they had the PL, which 1s the approval of a in their name, and the silver has that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And they established themselves in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They all died fairly young, not the children necessarily, some yes, but fairly — sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were already in their fairly old age. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single and died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">He was — he had been a mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">He was a organizer of the <span class="BUILDING">sports club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He was the organizer of — he was the head of the soccer club even though he never played soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">He organized everything in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">He was especially having to do with music. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He loved music. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">He played the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He organized two different kinds of orchestras. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He was the heart of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in terms of any kind of cultural life. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And he was ten years older than she, and they knew each other especially from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> because he was a director of a part of another <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , and she worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And, again, I know that only from stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I asked him many times afterwards, “So, why didn’t you get married for such a long time?” </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I’m not too sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, “Well, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">There was no need to get married.” </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that’s how he always said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But I’m sure that my grandparents did not — were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he’s always present. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So, it wasn’t like he wasn’t accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So, they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">They actually had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to get married because you couldn’t get married in a civil ceremony in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , that is, and neither of them was converting to anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So, they got married in a civil ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we basically had lived was the <span class="BUILDING">Vrancic house</span> , and then they and my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of their own, but it was within the same compound, the same land base. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So, that’s how we ended up having these two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> on the bottom for my uncle, a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Is this why there’s a kind of confusion in you about where you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  Because everything was so close that you can’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Exactly, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So, I sort of have memories of Vika living by herself in that big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in that one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We were living in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I don’t know at one point that was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  So, it’s confusing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  It’s very confusing as to where I was living at what time because we did move around, but only within those three <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> sort of, and my grandfather, I think, I spent the least time there, and of course, I was the youngest so that I remember that the least, and I remember the <span class="BUILDING">Vrancic house</span> the best, because Vika eventually died during the war, and she died I think while my uncle was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and I remember seeing her dead, that was more scary than some of the battles because I ran into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and nobody told me she was dead and there she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from then on, and that’s, you know, I remember, that’s — we were set then in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from then on.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Do you have any recollection of your Uncle Ludva being taken or going or leaving or not being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  Not being there, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Being taken away, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I must not have been present. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But not being there, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I remember that Giza was very sad and very upset much of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I remember that we were allowed to make packages and send them, and I remember very well that she was making packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I remember her making sort of vats of this roux. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">This was what was being sent, roux. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And so you — you made this brown mass which would then congeal and solidify, and then he would put — he would use that to put in the water to make sort of a soup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  He was where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> , and eventually when he would return — luckily I found out, I mean, he was lucky that he returned, but he saw my father there. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So, my father was there for also for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He was taken with a number of other non-Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , and they were there, I can’t remember for how long, but at least a year, I think, and I don’t know why, I’ve forgotten, but certainly I talked to him afterwards, but I don’t have a good memory of how long he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But I do know all the stories he told me when he returned of how and why he survived, and basically they found out that — well, they knew — that he was a banker, and so they put him to work in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> to balance their books, to work on the books, and so that he didn’t have to be out in the rain and snow and people, there was one person in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> who was an Ustashe but not one of those — not one of those that went around killing people necessarily, and he was reasonably kind to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">In fact, after the war, I have definite memories of Stricek sending packages to him because later on, he was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , I mean, yeah, in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for many years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But this is so — the one thing that saved him was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">The other thing that saved him was that he was always, as I told you, an organizer of things cultural, and they wanted to have, the Ustashe wanted to have entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So, he organized a chorus, and he collected anybody that he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So, there were some nieces of his — second niece because he didn’t have brothers and sisters, cousins, two cousins’ daughters were there — he collected all these people and they created a chorus. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So, of course, he claimed to have to practice if they wanted to have a good performance. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So, that saved them also from having to work so hard, and they’d sometimes allow them access to some more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">He said my father, on the other hand, worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Nevertheless, my father survived until the very end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  He did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  But didn’t your father sing? </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So, how come he didn’t get into the chorus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Well, he, yeah, he may have, but that’s — I think, in fact, he did, but there were people that they didn’t want to — that didn’t allow them to be collected because people who were young and strong, they made them work. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I think that my — Stricek remembers my father working with bricks, and carrying stones and bricks and things, but he was much, much younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Stricek at that point, he was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moment’s notice, and he was — he would have never made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So, anyway, at one point, they released that group and they all came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  Now, was that surprising?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I was very surprised at that for much of my life until very recently when I was working on the Jasenovac files.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  At the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  Yes, at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , and I found out that that was — that was very much a norm, that a lot of people especially those who were not Jews or Serbs, but were Croats who were just thought to be Partisan sympathizers and so on, that they were coming and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">There are many testimonies that I have listened to now, and much material that I had seen, that people would say that they were released, and even Magda, we were talking to Magda. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">She was saying how people were collected to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> and they were released to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and get their clothes or something, and it seems that while they were extremely cruel, within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> , that they were also very disorganized, and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I believe that was the most amazing thing that I found in reading the Jasenovac material, to what extent people were constantly being moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radiska</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lepoglava</span> , spending times on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going back and forth, sometimes being released. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">It’s amazing, and we haven’t quite figured out. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Lucie and I are both very surprised, and we haven’t quite figured out what 1s the basis of that except that we feel that there was not a total organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  Now, did your uncle come back before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giza</span> was deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  They were able to spend some time together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  Spend some time together, but then I don’t know why he wasn’t — I don’t know where exactly he was physically when somebody — when somebody came to get her. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">She was apparently denounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">As I told you, that whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very good about not denouncing anybody, but there was one person, and Stricek knew who that was, and I wish for history’s sake that I could remember his name now, but I can’t, who denounced her, and they came and got her. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Somebody did warn her. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I think she hid in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> of that unfinished <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but they found her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  She was denounced as what? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">As a sympathizer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  As a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  As a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="541">But wouldn’t she have been listed as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  She was, but people weren’t paying that much attention to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">She’s on the list because the picture I have of the list, she’s on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  They weren’t doing very much with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  No, they weren’t doing anything, but at that moment, I don’t know whether it was a particular person, a particular person who was in charge, even — it was towards the end, they were already losing the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  This was late, this was 1944?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  It was very late, 1944, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was very, very late, and then Stricek tried to go after her. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">He did go after her. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">He followed her and went all the way to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and tried desperately to get her out, and was unable to get her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We think that she was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but we don’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We never found any records, and that was the end of her, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  When he came back, did you stay with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Yeah, I stayed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I stayed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">That was pretty much already almost the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And...

<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  In 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So, as people are leaving and Giza is clearly an important person to you, you have some sense of who she is, her disappearance, does that...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  That was very upsetting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  Does that bother you in a way that the others would not because you were so little?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  Yeah, they all bothered me that they would be going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I just didn’t know how going away, you know, what — you know, you go away, you come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I think with her, I already had a sense that perhaps she won’t come back, that bad things were going on, that people die. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I think at that point, I-
QUESTION:  Do you think you understood what death was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  I think, well, yeah, I’ve seen — I saw a lot of death since then, all the battles, all the dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">You know, living nights — oh, I didn’t tell you about one night when there was a big battle and the big <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> which was just a little bit more than a block from us was set on fire by the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">That was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">People crying because — all over the <span class="DLF">street</span> — because everything, all the wheat or corn, whatever they had that was to sustain them for the year was in the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> ready to be milled and it all burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">The smell in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for a long time, the smell hung around of this burnt stuff, and people who were, you know, I, at the point, I understood — I understood what it means to die, or to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So, I remember being upset, and I remember Stricek being very upset for a long time afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Did he say anything to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Does he tell you that he has tried to find her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">At that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  I think so, Again, you know, do I remember it then, or do I remember it a year later or in 1956? </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It is very hard to tell, but I think I had the sense of what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  Was he a loving person to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Very, very, he was one of the sweetest people that you could imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Not only to me, he was Stricek, which is dimunitive [sic] for uncle, to the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and because I called him that, everybody called him that. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He 1s referred to as Stricek Ludva by everybody, and there is — there is a monograph, well, there is a history of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> published by a Mrs. Winter, and it came out about two years ago, and there are sections on a variety of topics including Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , oh, Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , but there is a few people have their own chapter, and there is a chapter on him with pictures, and it’s Nas Stricek Ludva, which means “Our Uncle Ludva’, that’s what he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always open and full of people and company and he was — he was — he was the most loving person you could imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I was extremely lucky, extremely lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Was Giza like that, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  She was much quieter. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">He was, you know-
QUESTION:  He was the social one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  He was the social one, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">She was much quieter, and, of course, she — I only knew her in really bad times, where I knew him afterwards, after the war, when his true self came forth, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So, it’s interesting because one of the things that this Mrs. Winters says, she says, “All the good things...”’, she was, by the way, very famous, a very well-known person in the Partisans during the war, and she considered herself a historian, and I am sorry, very sorry that she died before I could talk to her because she writes very nice things including about him, including the fact that he adopted me and my brother after the war, and then she says things like, in one sentence she says that even that was not, that he lost so much during the war, and then in the end he even lost me because I married this in quotes: “rich Jew”, which made me just wrinkle because my husband was anything but rich, and that I left and left him there, which of course wasn’t the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Yes, I left, but very much with his — with his approval, and he knew he was quite elderly and he knew that he wanted me to have as good a life as I possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And he did everything 1n his life to make my life as good as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  So, do you remember liberation as liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  What I remember most is columns and columns of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ustashe</span> being marched through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and being taken who knows where, and all of us standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and looking at these people and these forced marches that they were on. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I don’t know where they were going and to where they were going, and there wasn’t anybody that knew, but everybody sort of standing around and these people were hungry and they were thirsty and here and there people gave them a little water, but other than that, people just stared as they were walking by, and so all of a sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were reversed and everybody was saying, “They deserve it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And that is what I remember most 1s this, you know, the conquered people walking by.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">QUESTION:  Were they yelling at them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  I don’t remember yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I think, in fact, there was quite a lot of silence, sort of, we were just staring at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There were huge number, there were thousands of people being marched by, what looked to me like thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Were they going north? </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Do you have any recollection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  They were going — I remember which way they were going in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , and they were going east.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  East?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  East. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So, because I mean, we were between — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> is between two larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koprivnica</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span> ’s to the west, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koprivnica</span> to the east, and they were going across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koprivnica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">What happened after that, I don’t know, but you know, that was --
QUESTION:  But, you knew from your war games at the very least-
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Who was the enemy and who wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Oh, boy did we know who was the enemy all of the time, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We knew who the enemy was. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We were free when the Partisans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">You know, I didn’t have to pretend. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">At anytime that the Ustashe were in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I had to — well, I had this red hair, flaming red hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I was extremely noticeable because there isn’t a Croat almost anywhere with red hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  Only Jewish Croats?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  Yes, I did not know any red heads, and so there was a time that Pavelic came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I think it was towards the end sometime, I don’t know exactly why he was invited — he was a speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Well, all my friends were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I wanted to go too, to see, and I was told absolutely not, and I remember that I was told I could look — we had a <span class="DLF">stone fence</span> , and I could look across the <span class="DLF">stone fence</span> , peer out. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It was in the summertime I think, but I had to wear a hat on my head because you don’t want any strangers not noticing you with this red hair, and my brother also had red hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  I was going to ask you if he had red hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Yes, the two of us had red hair, and we kept waiting for someone in the family to have red hair, but my grandson has slightly reddish, but it’s my — the males in my family seem to have red beards, but I’m the only redhead female so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  It was really flaming red?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  Yeah, very red hair yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So, that was a real liability, and peasant women would come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and tell me horrible stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I remember one telling me, one time — I don’t know if it was during the war or not, but I remember she told me, “If you ever go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span> ’’, the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , “be very”, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , my goodness, “be very careful not to go near any kind of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there is a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> because, you know, they might catch you and press you and make medicine out of you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You know, there were — in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , these kind of prejudices and misinformation are rampant. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So, I knew that my red hair was some kind of a liability and I was to hide it all times, and I hated it, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  You didn’t like it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  I did not like it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I just hated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I felt like, “Okay, so maybe I’m redhead because I’m Jewish, I’m different.” </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And, I didn’t like being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I mean, it was a liability, and anyway, at that point, I really didn’t know that Jewish was anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  But, you knew Jewish was bad in terms of the Ustashe, not in terms of being Croatian, or could you not make that distinction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  I don’t think I could make that distinction. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Again, you know, I knew that this was something that they could catch me for and I would be in trouble, but no one told me, you know, no one told me why it was bad being Jewish, or why it was — or maybe if they told me I did not understand or I didn’t understand, but I just knew that nobody ever said bad things to me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">No one said, “Oh, you’re a Jew, therefore” or “it’s bad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I mean I knew from being in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I just started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I was, really, in first grade before the war, and we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sunday and we would line up and go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I knew that I didn’t know some of their songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I was inventing. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I remember inventing songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They would be singing something like, and I knew the melodies but I sometimes didn’t know the words, and I would be inventing something about birds singing or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But, you know, I lived across from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I’d go there with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And I knew very — I knew very early that Jews — that there were Jews who killed Jesus, and that that was bad, and I didn’t want to be part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But that’s what I knew, and I didn’t have any idea after the war what Jewish was, but of course, after the war, it didn’t matter because nobody followed any religion after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  Were you asked or trained in some way to be a little Catholic girl so that in case-
ANSWER:  Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  So, did you go to <span class="BUILDING">catechism</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  You did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  Mm-hmm, but we had it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We had it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the first year that I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we had catechism in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which is interesting because before the war, there was — there was — religion was taught apparently in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and I have this picture of my grandfather teaching Jewish children, and then there was — there was a Russian — there was an Orthodox priest teaching whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">There were Orthodox children, there were Serbian children, and then there was the Catholic priest, but of course, during the war there was only Catholic, but I don’t remember so much any priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Somehow I’ve don’t — but, I— I do remember the book of catechism in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I don’t remember who was teaching it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  Was this after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giza</span> was taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  That I can’t tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">That I can’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  Do you think it was when you were five years old or six?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  It must have been at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at five. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">In <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , you didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until you were seven, and they smuggled me into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> early. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I think my uncle felt like, “What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">She’s already starting to read, let her to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And because of his position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or their position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we were friends with all the teachers, they just let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I was the youngest as it is even when I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I was the youngest, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Did you like <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  I liked <span class="BUILDING">church</span> because it was sort of like, there was music and pomp and circumstance, you know, there, you know, you got dressed up and there were holidays, but I don’t know so much, I mean, you know, because I remember girls having to get dressed up and you would go in a procession and throwing rose petals around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Now, did you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> when you’re at grandfather’s? </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  No <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  I don’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  Right, so, your physical experience with religion is Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  Yes, as a child, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  You know that you’re Jewish, but it’s not your experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">That was not my experience until I was 16 years old, but, of course, I had no experience with any, you know, and I knew who — I mean, I knew who I was because I had my own — my grandfather’s books were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Again, I don’t know exactly who must have been Ludva Vrancic’s teacher who somehow facilitated for the books, the main books, to be taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that my grandfather built, lived, and being brought to the <span class="BUILDING">Vrancic household</span> and being put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So, that is how I end up having a lot of my grandfather’s books, not my grandfather’s, but the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ’s books, some of my grandfather’s books. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So, they were all stored there. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So, I knew, you know, what Hebrew looked like, and that, but that was the language that was used. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I have pictures of my grandfather, you know, wearing different kind of clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I remember things like my Aunt Giza when one time when we escaped together, because there was going to be a raid and we went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span> , and I remember that she wasn’t going to eat in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I used to eat, but she opened a can of sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I remember that so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I remember her can of sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So, she was obviously keeping kosher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  Kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">In some way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But, you know, I was, you know, I was eating everything everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">When I think about eating, the thing that I remember the best is when I was staying with the Runjak family, sometimes when the Ustashe were there, and we stayed — Mr. Runjak was a painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I don’t mean art. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I mean <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And she was a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">She took care of cataracts. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Everybody seemed to have cataracts, not cataracts, I’m sorry, trachoma. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">There was a lot of trachoma, and she was-
QUESTION:  What’s that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  It’s — trachoma is a, I think it’s also the word in English, but it’s a disease of the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  Glucoma?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  No, no, not glaucoma. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We have to look that up, but I think it’s trachoma, and I think it’s — it’s a transmittable disease and a lot of peasants had it, and she was — she had a little <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> of sorts that she ran and they all came to her for her to take care of the eyes, but there was very little money in that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I mean, there were three, you know, three teenage kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I think one, or maybe two of them still survive and I see them when I go back, and so, food was precious, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Though I was never hungry, really hungry at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">That comes from living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where everybody had <span class="REGION">land</span> and chickens and things, but I remember that Mr. Runjak because he was going to work, he could have scrambled eggs for breakfast, and we all had to take turns, who was going to get the empty pan and a piece of bread to eat — to rub the bread in the fat and eat it, or maybe have a crumb or two of the egg left. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I remember that very well.</span></p>

QUESTION:  When there was liberation, were you expecting Giza to come back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  People were — I don’t know what I expected, but everybody kept asking me this question. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Like, you would be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and some stranger would come and say, “Are you expecting your mother and father to come back?” </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Lots of people asked me that question, and not only at the time of liberation, but much later on, and people would concoct stories, you know, and say, well, they heard so-and-so was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> for such-and-such a time, and they returned, and am I expected somebody to come back’? </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And I may have expected somebody to come back, but not terribly actively. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Some people, of course, came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Two of my uncles returned, but of all the family, that’s all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  And did they want to adopt you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  Yes, they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> looking for me, looking to — not just for me; looking to see who was there, who survived of my mother’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">One of them was my mother’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">He’s the only one actually of the entire Deutsch family who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">On my father’s side of the family, a few siblings survived, half of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And this uncle, my Uncle Bernard, who goes now by Dov and lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he survived because he was prisoner of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">He remained — he was in the Yugoslav Army, and became prisoner — actually, Erne was also prisoner of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">They both were in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">They became prisoners of war, and so survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">It was a much easier survival from what — I just spoke to Bernard very recently and he was telling me stories, how they basically lived the same way like the rest of the prisoners of war, and they were able to get packages and they were fed reasonably decently, et cetera, et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So, the two of them returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Both of them asked me to go with them, and I absolutely refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">When I think about, at the age of seven, I was totally aghast that I would go with these people whom I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And my Uncle Bernard, Dov, got married to another survivor, this survivor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Estie</span> (ph), she survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">They left <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and then eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> where they still live. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">My other uncle, Erne, got remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">His wife, Irma (ph), and daughter, Edita (ph), were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">By the way, that’s one of my really vivid memories — his daughter was at one point released from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and I remember her coming to my grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and being totally skin and bones, full of lice, and I remember that she looked weird, and they put tar on her head, and she just looked so crazy to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I was, obviously, a little girl, and again, she then continued to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> and not in total and absolute Anne Frank- style hiding, and then she was taken away again. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But, anyway, she then was taken away and was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But he remarried, Erne remarried, and married a woman who became a widow and had two children, and they eventually left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I remained behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I think that from the date of the adoption — I was adopted by my uncle, and my brother also, almost immediately after the war in 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  This is before the came — before the brother-
ANSWER:  I have a feeling that it was before they came, and so, you know, there was a great tug of war, and I never heard from either for a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I think they were very angry and upset.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  Now, were they angry at you? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">They were angry at-?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  Well, they were angry at my uncle, but 1t — it manifested itself with the fact that I never heard from them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">However, the person that I did hear from eventually, but I don’t remember how soon after the war, I heard from another uncle who survived, another of my father’s brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So, in my father’s family, there were six children, and one sister and two brothers survived, and this one brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> and then was rescued out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and he married Magda, and they had one child a seven-year-old child or so when I heard from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So, maybe he was — maybe he was about five, six at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So, it must have been, I think that child was born sort of °45, °46. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So, I heard sort of into the ‘50s more or less continually from them, and remember very vividly getting a package from them, a ball point pen where you could see through the plastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">That was so exciting, and a red plastic little purse like that, and a box of Frigor chocolates, my box of Frigor chocolates, very exciting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">QUESTION:  Frigor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">ANSWER:  Frigor, the Swiss brand. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were living in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Of course, we had no — after the war we had so little, and we, as a family, had more. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I mean Stricek and I and my brother, had more than many families. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But, anyway, this whole chocolates and stuff came much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It came after my brother was no longer in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit just about this tragedy with-
ANSWER:  With my brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  With your brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  Now, there we were having survived the war, and it was September and everything was going fine, and it was time to go and have — and collect grapes, have a grape harvest, and we were at the grape harvest, and the day after my brother was sick, and it just seemed to be sick like children get sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And then his temperature went up and up and up, and then it turned out that two other children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> apparently had scarlet fever, and it turned out it was scarlet fever, but it really wasn’t diagnosed in time, and — in time for the doctor to say, “Go to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ,” which was 25 kilometers from us, or “Let’s go get penicillin someplace,” and apparently he had a weak heart, and he was sick for three days and he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">It was quite a tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was a tragedy for me, even then, and I was old enough to realize it, I don’t think I was nearly as affected as Stricek was. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I don’t think he ever got over his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">He just adored that child. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He adored me, too, but I think he really adored my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And I was — the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> mourned. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">It was really sad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">It was just, you know, I think scarlet fever is a bad disease even now, and at that time I think there was just no — we had no antibiotics. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">It was right after the war, and nobody was alert enough to realize that you could die that fast from something like that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="785">You just go, “Oh, the kid is sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">He has a high fever.” </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So, it was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">It was tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So, after that, I was an only child, and with not a single blood relative remaining within <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So-
QUESTION:  Did you feel almost like Ludva was as good as a blood relative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I never — no, I’m only making a statement, a general statement, but it wasn’t that I felt that he was any different then a blood relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I really felt like he was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And the only time that I used to think how sad it was that I didn’t have my parents, and I know that sounds terrible because people often ask me that, you know, “How did you feel about your parents?” </span><span class="sentence" id="795">but, because I didn’t know them, and I didn’t have that experience, it was only theoretically that I missed my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Aunt Magda gets very upset when I say that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  It makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  It makes sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The only time that I would, you know, feel sorry for myself, was when something would happen that I would get punished for something, and then I would say, “If my mother were alive she wouldn’t do XYZ,” you know, like I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">If we had succession of cleaning ladies and housekeepers. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We had some very nice housekeepers, some people who were very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">But if I would get punished or had to clean my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or whatever I had to do, I would say, “If my mother was alive, I wouldn’t have to be doing this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Of course, I would have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  Yes, would you say that out loud?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  No, but I would think that to myself, feeling sorry for myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">QUESTION:  Now, you said at some point this afternoon, that your father actually survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Is that the case? </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Or up to the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">ANSWER:  From what I was told by people — a person who apparently witnessed my father’s death, is that at the end — at the end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> , there were many outbreaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">There was a major one at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I keep reading about that in all the records. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">But, apparently, there was confusion and they were killing people en masse and so, people were trying to escape and there was — it seems that my father and a few other people escaped at the very end, and that they went someplace into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and then came down — came close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> looking for the food, and that they were surprised by a German, I think, German patrol, or Ustashe patrol, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And, then he was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So, that’s the most unfortunate, that he was able to survive until the very end, and then not make it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  This is going to sound like an odd question, but do you think that if your parents had come back, you would have felt about them the way that you did about the two brothers who came? </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Just like, “Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  Possibly, but I think I understood parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I understood -
QUESTION:  You understood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Yeah, I understood the concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I understood that, and I think Stricek would have understood and would have — would have given me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Yeah, given me away, I mean, he could have kept me. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">You know, I was, to him, basically a grandchild because my aunt — my aunt, who was his wife, as I said, was 15 years older, then he was 10 years older than my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So, there was a 25 year gap.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">QUESTION:  Between your parents and him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  So, how old do you think he was at the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  So, he was born in 1885. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I’m very bad at math.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  So, he’s 45 or 50?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  In his 50s, right, and so — oh, when did I feel sorry for myself for not have had my parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="831">For example, he was fairly strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">When I was a very little child, I could do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I could climb <span class="DLF">walls</span> if I wanted to, but as I got older and older, then restrictions remained, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I had to be careful about this and that, and boys and so on, and then I was always — I would always say, “Well, you see, he’s so old, he doesn’t understand anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">If I had younger parents, they would have understood.” </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Nonsense, of course, but, you know, that’s — it’s a good way of looking at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So, I always used to say, “I’m going to have my children very young so that Ill understand them better.” </span><span class="sentence" id="838">We’d have to ask my children how I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I did have my children very young, but I don’t think that that was necessarily what happened, but I always worried about him getting married, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  And what would happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  And what would happen, and there was some possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">We had some very appropriate housekeepers at times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  What did you think would happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="844">That they would not want you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  No, no, no, I didn’t think that. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I was just jealous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">QUESTION:  You liked having him to yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, you know, I was in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">QUESTION:  When you think back now, does it surprise you that someone who 1s 55 years old would want to adopt a little girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t -
QUESTION:  Or, was he just very special?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">ANSWER:  He was just very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I — I don’t think, I’ve never thought about it in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Of course, if I think now, I find a 55 — I mean, I remained a widow at the age of 54. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">That’s about the same age, and I certainly wouldn’t think about starting at this point to adopt a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So, I can imagine that age very much, but I think I was there all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It was just, you know, it was just a paper thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">It wasn’t a — it was just continuing status quo rather than creating something new.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  Clearly, he loved Giza so much and the family, that there was no way that he was going to abandon you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  Or your brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">ANSWER:  No, no, no, I was just part of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  And, he — from your description, he was such a social person -
ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">QUESTION:  That privacy was not the big issue for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">ANSWER:  Oh, it wasn’t an issue at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">There was no privacy in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">No, there was somebody there from morning, noon ‘til night, there were always people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there was always something being served. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And people were always visiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So, that wasn’t an issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">QUESTION:  Did he tell you about your parents, what he remembered about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">ANSWER:  He told me, but he didn’t know my parents all that well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  He didn’t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  No, I mean, he knew — he knew my mother, but he barely knew my father, because my parents were married about two years or so when I was born, and my father never lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , and Stricek never lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">So, I mean, you know it was — he knew my mother as a young woman growing up, and she was away at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of course, because there was, you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> , there were only eight grades of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and so, my mother already was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cakovec</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the age of 13 or 14, whenever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So, I’m sure he didn’t know her all that well to be able to tell me very much about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I mean, there were always things he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I mean, music was extremely important to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I was always told I needed to study music, and my mother sang very well apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So, that was always told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I was always told that she was very good with languages, which I inherited somehow and also I could sing, so that was always, “That’s what you have from your mother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Well, both my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">My mother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cakovec</span> for a bit of time, and apparently learned Hungarian while she was there, just as a side thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">So, it was a big thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">To study languages was very important, and I was always given all the opportunities, but, you know, I was given a lot of opportunities and I was aware of that because we lived surrounded by in this world of <span class="DLF">farms</span> and farming families, and there were very few so-called “intellectuals” families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and you know, I was one of those, and I had more than most people, and I was made aware, you know, of, you know, noblesse oblige, and I had to behave well, and I was told I had to learn how to do things in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so that I can tell maids what to do, those kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So, I knew I sort of lived in sort of semi-privileged world, and I enjoyed it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I liked to learn, and I, you know, there were books everywhere, and for fun I was reading Dante’s Trilogy. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I love to look at the pictures of the Inferno.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">QUESTION:  It must have reminded you of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER:  Yeah. [</span><span class="sentence" id="889">Laughs. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">|
QUESTION:  How does he earn a living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  He was back to being a bank director.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  Oh, he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So, he was doing very well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Well, you know, in that world, comparatively. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Yes, we — we still had, of course, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then we were — there were — he was constantly working on getting some of the other things back, like the vineyard was left to us, but, of course, that was always an outlay of money, because we had to pay somebody to work it and then nobody ever sold anything practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">We only sold wood — there was a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we could sell wood and gravel, and then there was stuff in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we were able to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">There was jewelry left from before the war, and slowly we sold quite a bit of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I have a very vivid memory of taking some chains which I liked very much, gold chains, and having to — somebody came and put them on the scale, and that was the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">But, that is how — oh, and there were clothes from his sisters and so on that we slowly sold, and extra <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and we traded for things like potatoes and whatever, you know, else we needed to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">QUESTION:  What happened in terms of religion? </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Was he an observant Catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">QUESTION:  Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He was not an observant Catholic, but I don’t remember him ever going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">There was sometimes things that we did do in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I remember that we did have a Christmas tree, mainly because the maids or the housekeepers or whoever they were put one up, and I would, of course, couldn’t help but love it, and I’d get presents. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And, the only other thing that I have a memory of besides that holiday, was that the day — Three Kings Day, whatever it’s called now. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">You know, it’s the last day of Christmas, after Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">The custom in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> was for the priest to come through the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and do -
QUESTION:  Bless?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  Yes, so that was the only issue — that was the issue, but I promised, I promised solemnly that I would finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that I would go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I thought, oh, God, starting all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I started <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , first I had a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Then, I started in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and I had a hard time because I was having to study in French and I had studied English and German before and Russian but very little French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I learned French, and I came here, and I thought, ““Goodness, now what?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And, so I got pregnant instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So, I had my daughter, and that was nice because I was sometimes feeling lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I mean, then, my husband was a super-wonderful person, the very best, but I went from one wonderful person who took care of me, to my aunt and uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , to Dan, who could’ve been — who was everything that my uncle had been, just really nurturing and he was nine years older than I and had had his PhD and he was marrying this sophomore who doesn’t know from beans and coming to this new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So, it was quite an experience to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And so, sometimes — and there was nobody else here — so sometimes I was lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">It was good to have my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Then, when, Elliott, my son, was born a year and a half later, when he started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I did go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">QUESTION:  You did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">ANSWER:  Yes, I did go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I did finish, and I had a long teaching career. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">So, I did accomplish that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">QUESTION:  And, when you left <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , how long was it before you saw Uncle Ludva again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">ANSWER:  It was, let me think when I was born in — I think it was something like six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I could not go back earlier because, even if I had had money, because I didn’t — did not want to return without the American citizenship, maybe it was less than that, and I applied for it as soon as I could, which I was three years after I was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So, I had a year in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and then I had three years here before I could apply, and then it took them a year to give it to me because I came from a Communist country and we were in the post- McCarthy era and they investigated me to no end, demanding why I hadn’t protested when I had to join the Communist Youth of Yugoslavia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Can you imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">If P’'d protested, I’d be in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So -
QUESTION:  You were also a kid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  I was also a kid, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">So, it took them a year, and as soon as I got it, then I asked for a release from the Yugoslav citizenship, which I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Then, I went back because it was still very, very difficult to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and then I went to back and went already with the two kids and my husband and it was wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">QUESTION:  And is this the first time they’ ve met your husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1133">ANSWER:  He met my husband, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">He couldn’t come to the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I mean, he could have — he could have possibly come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">He could’ve gotten a visa, et cetera, et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">It would’ve taken time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">It took me six months every time to get a visa, but he was really, at that time, feeling his age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">He was not ever strong particularly, and at that point he was barely leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> anymore, and he really felt like he could not leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I mean, go on such a trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And so, he wasn’t at my wedding, which of course, was a pity, but it’s sad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">QUESTION:  It must have been wonderful for him to see the grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, that was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">We had a super time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1144">QUESTION:  Did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1145">ANSWER:  Yeah, really a good time, and we stayed a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">It was really nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1147">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Fabulous!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Not Dan, but the kids and I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">QUESTION:  So, the kids got a sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1152">ANSWER:  The kids, yes, and Wanda still has a good sense of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Elliott was a little too young to remember a lot, but Wanda, I think, does remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">She was then in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">QUESTION:  Now, a lot of people think the Holocaust changed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">In a way, I suppose you think you didn’t go through the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">ANSWER:  Sometimes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">It took me a long time to understand that I’m a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I never classified myself as such until very recently, when people told me, “Of course you are a Holocaust survivor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1160">QUESTION:  And, what does that — does it mean something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">ANSWER:  Right now, it does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">It means — it mean more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I understand — I’ve met now other people who didn’t go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and, you know, we think of them now as Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I used to think that a Holocaust survivor means someone who has gone through a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which I was extremely lucky not to have gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">On the other hand, how do you define Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">There was Holocaust all around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I just have happened to have been at the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the right time, or all the wrong time I was in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> not to be swept — swept up with the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So, I was just super-lucky in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">QUESTION:  Except for the losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">ANSWER:  Except for the losses, people losses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">The losses, the losses, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">QUESTION:  Even though you were little it was -
ANSWER:  There’s a sense of loss, and you realize it more after I had children, I became much more aware of the losses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And I think at that point, you can put yourself in the other shoes — not what it did to me, but what must it have done to my mother and my father to have your child taken away, to not know what’s going to happen to that child, to be stuck some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and you don’t know where your children are, whether they’re dead or alive, all of that — you become aware of that and internalize it, and think of it in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">So, that’s, you know, that’s — you can understand what it means to lose a child, and now I can understand what it means to lose a spouse, which is the saddest thing for me right now, still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">QUESTION:  Dan died in 54?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">ANSWER:  No, Dan died in ’92.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">QUESTION:  Oh, I’m sorry in 92.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">ANSWER:  In °92, right, and that was a hard loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1179">QUESTION:  It still is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, and that’s a kind of loss that I think I can understand sometimes people who —I was a child, so, I can see the child-parent relationship and what it would be like for my parents, but then, you know, Stricek mourned Giza forever and ever, and I can understand that very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">QUESTION:  Now’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">ANSWER:  Yeah, and he mourned my brother terribly forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">So, later on, you realize it, and yeah, I suppose, I now understand it what it means to be a survivor, and it’s not the easiest <span class="NPIP">place</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I think I cope well, but that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">QUESTION:  You also seem to have enjoyed life in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1186">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I had a very good life in many ways, have good colleagues, good work — I love my work, I still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I think — I think I’ve had a sort of joie de vivre built in that is not — it’s not easily extinguishable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">QUESTION:  Well, thank you so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1190">ANSWER:  Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">It’s been very pleasant talking to you.</span></p>
