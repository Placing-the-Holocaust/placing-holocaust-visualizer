QUESTION:  -- and background of the family --
ANSWER:  -- and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I lived in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  We found that before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Oh sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Well, my name 1s, my real name is Estella Rubinlicht and I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that became very infamous because of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that we had next door my --------. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was born to a nice Jewish family, traditional, observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Both of my parents were professional people which was a little unusual for the circumstances of Jews living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother was a dentist who put herself through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , while my father was a court-appointed interpreter in three languages, and I also had a little brother, who was seven years younger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> had about 140,000 to 150,000 inhabitants. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We had a very famous yeshiva, and also I would say that about 60,000 out of the population have been Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Before the war, I was little but we kind of enjoyed normal life for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We were allowed to practically do everything, except Jews couldn't hold any government jobs, and also going into the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was very complicated being a Jew -- there was a special quota for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But I happened to attend <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> , both <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> both private, because simply there was a better education my parents could afford. </span><span class="sentence" id="13"><span class="BUILDING">Public school</span> was compulsory but <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was not available to all the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I had a very happy childhood, very close-knit family, lots of love, two sets of grandparents, not too big of a family, we were not a very large family; but kind of well-to-do, not extravagant, and very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I had a happy childhood until when I was twelve years old the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The rumor started in 1939 in the summer when we as teenagers were going to the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and doing all kinds of summer things, and the rumor started that there was going to be a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My father at dinnertime -- we always had dinner together, that was the family thing to do -- told us that we had to be prepared ----------- and maybe we should accumulate some more food, because for a certain time things are going to be going on that are going to be bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Nobody ever expected what is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">People thought that maybe there would be a war that would blow over, and that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I mean, in the history of the world never anything like that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So the Jews were quite sedate. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They kind of thought, you know, that whatever happens, just happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">https://collections.ushmm.org And it wasn't until suddenly on the first of September, 1939, that we woke up to severe bombing and not being prepared and of knowing what it 1s really, we all went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and stayed there while the raid was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">When we came out, there was a realization that we had war and that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Well, there was panic, we didn't know what to do, and people were completely at the stage of panic, they didn't know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Well, this state of affairs did not take too long, because after four days the Polish government went away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the next day on the fifth day of this disarray, the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Now, all I saw was these mad Germans running around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and running into <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and just grabbing everything they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a group of Germans came in, tore the watch and everything they could off my mother's hands, grabbed all the things we had, took whatever they wanted to, broke china, beat us up, and went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">That was my first encounter with what the Germans are really like. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Then they were running around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they decided that they want men, so they gave an order that so-and-so many men have to come to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and of course we were very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">A lot of people at that time, as I recall, were running away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , east, and we even had an opportunity, our family to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that our neighbor owned and he wanted all of us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But you know, my mother was a homemaker, she had her livelihood there, they just couldn't part with things, they didn't know how to go to the unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And so, placidly, most of the Jewish population stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Some of them did go east, but my family decided to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Well, the next -- it was 1939, of course <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed, the Germans were riding around, there was a curfew after seven and we were right away given yellow our stars saying "Jude," that means Jew, we had to wear one on the left shoulder in front and one in the back so they could see us from the back and front. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And we were living under curfew with very little food, not knowing what's going to happen next. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Now, what happened in the period between 1939 and 1942 was the fact that the Jewish population was getting smaller and smaller and smaller because through different actions of taking people away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> the Germans would round up a certain area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , take out the Jews, beat them up, and ship them some <span class="NPIP">place</span> off. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We did not know what happened to these people, what happened to the families, because we had no contact with newspapers, radios, everything was taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So we merely existed, not in our own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">As the Jewish population was getting smaller and smaller, the Germans have been giving the Jews smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> to live, and because they wanted them all together, they were forming what wasn't even a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet but an <span class="REGION">area</span> that was dedicated for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And they would put, like, four or five families in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> so that when they need to take them out, 1t would be easier for them to have them all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Well, we lived through many of those actions, and fortunately both of my parents were working -- working so that the Germans needed them; therefore, we were spared at the beginning, because my mother as a dentist was working in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the Germans needed care. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Now, my father also had a job, in the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto,</span> so they also needed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But as I was already 14 years old, I needed a job on my own in order to be spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So I got a little job in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> helping out. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And that's how through all these actions we were able to somehow survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Food was scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My mother was getting a little bit of food from peasants who were coming still to her for medical advice, and so we survived until April 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">By April 1942 was one of those big actions where they took away a lot of Jewish https://collections.ushmm.org people, and out of 60,000 only 4,000 survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We were given special passes, special Reich documents like passports, and these were the 4,000 Jews that actually were working for the Germans and that the Germans decided to keep for a little bit longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We still did not know where all the people went. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Well, the state of living was just terrible, you know -- Germans were coming in, cutting off the beards of the Jewish people, they were beating them up, they were taking them out haphazardly, they were demanding things, soldiers were running around and taking advantage of women, they plundered. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There was practically nothing any more because we had lived in a little tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> where they put these 4,000 people to live; very inhumanly, in little <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> , in little <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where very poor peasants lived -- they had to be evacuated and they were given <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that the Jews lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">You could see a horse and a cow on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor balcony</span> because these people took all their belongings with them; we were put in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where these people lived before. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There they put a barbed wire and called it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but not in the idea of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , this was a settlement of Jews which were surrounded by barbed wire and constantly watched so there was no way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The people that watched, the soldiers that watched the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were mostly Lithuanians and Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were helping the Germans to keep order because the Germans could not be bothered with these little things like watching the Jews, they wanted them when they needed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> they were coming in like four in the morning wearing white gloves, dressed to kill as clean as they always were, and beat up the Jews and taking them out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">That state of affairs lasted from April '42 until November '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was still with my parents and I was still with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">In that little <span class="NPIP">place</span> we still managed to go out a little bit because we were young, and that's when I met my present husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Now, to back up a little bit, were there many children like your brother, your little brother, or how did you manage to keep him hidden with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">You had to work --
ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">At the times I just described, I was still with my parents, so we were still together, and we still had some means to buy some food on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So my brother was my responsibility, because up until that moment I was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my parents cared for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I even managed to go out for ice cream, not late in the evening, but we had a little <span class="DLF">garden</span> next to the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived and the Germans made sure that the Jews tilled the soil and grew some flowers because they had to show to the International Red Cross how nice the Jews had it in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And every morning at six o'clock we would be taken out through a <span class="DLF">gate</span> to work and taken to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And every day at six o'clock, they would bring us back, and then there was curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So that was the life that summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Now, not far away from this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , -------- [name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp]</span> and we saw the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> working on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> wearing these uniforms, and that's all we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We knew that there is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, and we saw the people, emaciated in these striped uniforms, showing us -- like this -- that they are hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But we were always in groups watched by the Germans and we were not allowed to have any contact with these people, they were digging <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And we knew that something is going on there, something very, very bad, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">In fact, our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was called -------- and the big concentration was called -------- https://collections.ushmm.org [both names]. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So there was a little bit interconnected this whole <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There was an incident where friend of my present husband had a sandwich, and so this Jew asked him for food and asked the guard -- whoever he was, I don't know if it was a German or Lithuanian -- if he may give him the sandwich, the guard said "yes" and as soon as he gave him the sandwich he shot him, he shot this friend of my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So there was the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I still was with my parents, I'm stretching it all the time because it really was the last time I was with my parents in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And having a very sheltered life and having a good home life, I really never thought was life is all about and how to go about managing it on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We didn't grow up as fast over there as children grow up today, and being 14, 15, really meant to be under the care of your parents all the time, especially when there were no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> -- I was completely cut off from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for three years already. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It wasn't until November 1942 that the tragedy happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">One early morning -- (she takes deep breath) I have to admit and I have to tell you there was no way to escape at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Even if we would like to stay outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was no way to do anything, there was no people that would take us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They were hunting Jews all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We had no papers, we could not get a job, we could not get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, we really couldn't go out and stay on the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They would find you sooner or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It wouldn't be the Germans, it would be the Poles that were the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But that was happening all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So it was on the morning in 1942 in November -- I don't know if it was the 6th or the 7th of November that we were woken up at three in the morning that we were told that everybody has to come to this big square because we cannot stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And we kind of had a feeling that this is the end of this little settlement of the Jews, because we heard rumors that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> had stopped existing all around in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So we knew that if we come to this square, they will take us away forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What happened was that my father arranged for my mother to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and stay there, thinking that maybe the Germans will honor the doctors still there, like they did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Some people had little hidings 1n their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> but we didn't have any, but my husband's parents had a little hiding spot in their little <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was really a double wall where you could stand like lined up in a queue if 1t were necessary, but not for too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Well, my present husband, who was at that time just a friend, came over running to our little <span class="NPIP">place</span> and he said, "Why don't they take her," meaning me, "to my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Because she doesn't really have such good papers and they probably will take her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And we have this little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , so me and my family are going in there." </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And we didn't even have time to think, I didn't have time to say goodbye to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My father said, "Go, Honey, it's the best thing for you to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I just went with him, and he said, "I am going to try to take care of my brother and see what we can do." </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And there was a -- I never saw my parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And so we went in to the hiding with my present husband, and we stayed in this little <span class="NPIP">wall hiding place</span> probably between six in the morning up until maybe two in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We tried not to cough, we tried not to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And then at two o'clock somebody knocked and said, "You might as well come out, this is the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">You will not survive here, there is no food, there going to come and raze all those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">There are proclamations all over on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , this is the end of this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and that all the Jews have to come to a certain <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek Concentration Camp</span> , because this 1s the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Well, my first thought was to go back to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and see if anybody is there but we weren't https://collections.ushmm.org allowed to move any more, we could only allowed to go to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">There were Germans 1n this ------- and they were showing you how to get to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and there was no other choice but to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My husband's parents said, "You are so young" -- he also had a sister -- "it's too bad, maybe you try to run away through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and maybe you can squeeze, at least the two of you to survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So we tried, it was bright daylight and we tried to -------- at one point, the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> , and to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Well, I have to tell you that around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there was nothing, which 1s plain <span class="DLF">fields</span> , for miles and miles to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it wasn't like you could run into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or something, there was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Well, we ran for about a little mile to a ------ and there was shooting but they didn't hurt us, but then finally one of those guards ran after us, beat my husband up -- he still has a permanent scar in his eye, no vision, and called us all kinds of names and told us "back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you go." </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So that was not successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">When we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I could not see my mother any more because my mother was already taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , the doctors, the staff, and all the people that were in there, I mean the patients, they were all taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so my mother was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , poor thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I saw my father, who was still around, and I saw my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And my husband's parents were still with us and we were thinking -- we had three days to go to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Well, we were making quick decisions, we didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We could not go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for any money or clothes or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">My husband's parents, unfortunately, decided that they will go to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and so did his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">She really did not want to live any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We were so broken up, we had no will to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We went through three years of dehumanization, deprivation, hunger and everything, and you know what ------------------- maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Moreover, ---------going on like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But my father said to us, I "really want somebody to provide for the family." </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I was thirteen and a half at this point. "</span><span class="sentence" id="129">We're going to try in the middle of the night when it's dark for young to get through the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And maybe you can survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So we passively said OK and we tried a couple of nights and we couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But then on the third night my father got some gold coins and some watches and some -------- together and said, "I will try to bribe some guard, maybe he will let you go." </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And on the third morning, about four o'clock -- 1t was in November, it was very dark, there was snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> -- my father arranged for the guards to look away, gave them all this stuff and said, "I want you to look the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I want my family to get out." </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And so, myself, my present husband, who was just a friend, and my little brother, who was nine years old, were practically pushed by my father through the barbed wire to go and survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I wanted my father to come with. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He said, "Oh no, I have to go to my ----- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I have to help your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I cannot go with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He said, "Go, and see what you can do for yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And so we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We had to walk quite a long while because there was nobody around. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And they were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But then we saw a peasant, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was very far, maybe ten kilometers away. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We saw a peasant and we asked him if he would give us a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He might have known who we are but he pretended maybe that he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We thought he's either going to kill us all or he's going to take us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He took us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> it was really bedlam because everybody knew that the --------------- and everybody knew the Jews were running away and everybody was looking for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And if you found a Jew and showed him to a German, you would get ten pounds of sugar or five pounds of flour, something like that, they were posted all over https://collections.ushmm.org looking for the Jews that are running way from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So it was impossible in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to really hide overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But fortunately my husband knew somebody that worked for my father and we walked in and said, "May we just stay overnight some <span class="NPIP">place</span> " and of course they were scared because you know they would find Jews by them, they would shoot them too. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So it wasn't only the point that they didn't want to help, because we knew some very fine people that were patients of my mother, and my mother told me she gave them stuff to hide like candelabra and linens and fur coats; in case we ever needed them they would be outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But when we came to these people they said, "Yes, you need somebody to help you out but we cannot let you overnight." </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The only person that let us overnight was this worker that used to work for my husband's father, and they put us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> full of coal and potatoes and everything that people put down there, and we stayed overnight, the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">A very unusual trio. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My husband was then 22, I was 16, and a nine-year-old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And we -------------. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We stayed overnight and we knew we had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we had no way to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but in the morning I heard that the Germans came in and shot my father, because my father still was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he was one of the last left ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And as he tried to get out I understood that he was shot <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">-------------ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So I was able to find that out, and of course my husband's father, mother and sister all went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> : the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we somehow scraped together enough to buy tickets on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where nobody knew us and we were dreaming and hoping that maybe we could establish our existence as Aryans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Well, that wasn't so simple because before we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I went into a lady whom my mother gave things to to keep for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">This lady was supposed to be a friend of my mother's and she also lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">In the meantime she told me to come back at a different hour and there were two Gestapo people waiting for me, so she wasn't friendly to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I almost lost my life at that point because they were walking with me and trying to take me to the Gestapo, and then they were calling for some other people -- it's impossible to describe the situation but I ran into a bombed-out building where there was a little <span class="DLF">door</span> and in this little <span class="DLF">door</span> was a shoemaker living and the shoemaker knew my husband, and that lady decided to hide me in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She really was the one that saved my life, because I knew that I cannot hide there, there was nothing there, just one little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a curtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She said, "You stand behind the curtain." </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My shoes were showing. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I said, "I can't jeopardize everybody else." </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And my brother and my husband were was sitting there in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but they didn't know my family, they just knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And somehow she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> real wide and we played the housing scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">As the Germans came up there to look for me, she didn't even let wait until they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">She came out, dusting off a little rug, and they said to her, "Did you see a Jewish woman running around here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="174">She said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She was an older, simple lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">She said, "No, I didn't see anybody here. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">This 1s all empty, there are no people walking through here." </span><span class="sentence" id="178">She said, "Well, there was a Jewish lady that we just lost sight of and she's somewhere here. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">No, you're welcome to come in, there is nobody here." </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The Gestapo people walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And as they walked to the end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I ran to the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So that was one of my very close encounters. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">From there we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">It was a long ride ---------. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I think my father put a little money in my pocket and that was just about all that we had but I had a very good pair of shoes, because every Jew believes that no https://collections.ushmm.org matter what happens with you, you have to have very good pair of leather shoes in case you have to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I also had a coat with a little fur underneath so in case I get stuck some <span class="NPIP">place</span> I should be warm; that's what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And of course my brother was with us, this little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> they made ------- all the time that we were Jews, smugglers and Jews, and again Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I don't know how we ever made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at four o'clock in the morning and they have these rickshaws that used to take to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , like either horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> to take a rickshaw, and as we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> they recognized us right away -- the Poles, not the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">See, the Germans per se would not recognize a Jew, they did not know, they were not aware of the characteristics of the Jews -- whether you had a long nose or whether your Polish is not proper or whether you speak with a Jewish accent; they did not know this but the Poles were absolutely acute to this, they were really experts. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So they somehow saw -- they were waiting for people to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they knew that the Jews are running -- and they saw my husband was given by one of his friends a fancy coat with a fancy hat and that is no ----- with us, they really didn't ------ to kill us------------ and right away when we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> and tried to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I thought maybe I could find -- I had an address -- some people who would help us out with false papers, or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They right away took us in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> and they were going and going and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I said, "Well, we wanted to go to this-and-that <span class="DLF">street</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He said, "Oh no, that's not where you're going." </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I said, "Where are we going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He said, "You're going to the Gestapo." </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I said, "Why is that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="199">He said, "Because you are Soviet Jews and we know you that you're hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And because you are Jews, you can't survive, we are taking you straight to the Gestapo." </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And they were Poles, young Poles, who were riding this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> and we said to them, "Stop! </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Why would you do that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="203">He said, "----------, you should get back to the Gestapo." "</span><span class="sentence" id="204">What do you care whether we live or not?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="205">No, you have to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Well, whatever we had on we gave it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We stopped in a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> in a little corner of ------- <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I told them, "Whatever I have you can take. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I still have a little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">You can take my rings, you can take my watch, whatever I have, but please leave us here on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , don't take us." </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They stripped us of everything we had and left us in the corner of that <span class="DLF">street</span> by the <span class="DLF">door</span> of some <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So here we are, about twelve o'clock in the afternoon with nowhere to go, with nowhere to sleep, with no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Soon enough we had no choice but to try to find a way to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And we knew that this is suicidal. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We realized it but there was no other way for us -- we couldn't practically sleep on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Talking about homeless people today, you know, we were really homeless. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">There was just nobody I knew, nobody that I could talk to, but we knew one thing: we knew how to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">It also wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You just don't take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> intended for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and say, "I want to go in there." </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We decided, we knew, that the Jews come out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to work every day morning and they go back at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We knew that they go to work at the certain <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> , <span class="BUILDING">coal depot</span> , where they unload <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> of coal for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And we knew that if we go there and when we talk to the supervisor, who was Jewish, and if he has ------ people going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he will probably do us a favor and take us on. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I think it was November 9th or 10th. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We just went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ----- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and we found this group of Jews working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We talked to the fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We said, "Look: We are three people, we cannot stay on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , we have nothing, we want to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I had an uncle in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who was my father's brother https://collections.ushmm.org and I was hoping that at least I could go get a meal there and somebody to talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Because we were so tired from running and at this point we wanted to die as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Which later reversed itself, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But we were so tired of running, we see the best that all the other Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because we have no parents any more and nobody to take care of us, we're just alone, and whatever happens, happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So that night we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I remember that my brother had a little coat and on the coat there was a fur collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We had to tear off his collar and throw it out the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because Jews were not allowed to have any fur on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And whatever else we had, like a little suitcase, that had to all be taken away, thrown out, because we were going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And that's how we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was really not what I remembered from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , whether was barbed wire, it was summer, we had little flowers in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and there was my mother and father and somebody to protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That was a twelve-foot <span class="DLF">wall</span> , with people in there who were emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">It was almost the end thing of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It was the "small ghetto" what they call where people were laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , dead, covered up with newspapers; where there was absolutely no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">On the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> they were Selling horsemeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was absolutely a tragic picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And that's what we got into. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Unfortunately, we didn't get much help from the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">My family was not responsive to my needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The only thing they did when we got there, they meant us to ----- marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They said, "Are there two of you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I said, "Yes, we are friends, we knew each other briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It just so happens that we care for each other but I just lost my parents, he just lost his parents, I'm 16 years old, just to think of getting married is the last thing in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We want to survive." "</span><span class="sentence" id="251">Well," my uncle said, "You know that's not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">If you are going to be together you have to get married." </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I said, "Well, if you want to do it, then arrange for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Fine with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Well, my uncle found a rabbi, the rabbi didn't want to marry me, I was too young, but finally there was a rabbi who on a Saturday afternoon, December 13, married us in his little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , wherever he lived there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They got me some dress -- from a neighbor, I guess, because I didn't have anything, -- and we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We were married, then we were given a ------, you know, the Jewish certificate of marriage, which, incidentally later, was flushed down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> because when we became "Aryans," we couldn't have it, there was no document of marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And as we got married, my uncle said -- first of all he told us we can't stay with him; he still had a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and quite a bit of money and he said, "No, you can't stay here." </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So we had to find ourselves a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And fortunately I met some people who were from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and knew my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">As a matter of fact, one lady gave me her ring, her wedding band, to get married with, before the wedding, that we got married with. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They told us that they lived --------------, which at that time was not the headquarters of the uprising yet, and that they all have one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that that lady ---- 10 or 12 families, but they will be willing to designate a quarter for us so that we can go to the open-air <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and get a sack with straw, fill it, put it there, and live there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">That was end of December, beginning of January, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We did that and unfortunately my uncle did not want to keep my brother either, so I had to bring my brother into this settlement of people in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And we just existed, stmply. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My husband was going every morning with a group of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He was unloading coal, and as a reward he could take on his back a sack of coal as much as he could carry, four/for kilometers and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And because we didn't want to use the coal to heat our https://collections.ushmm.org apartment because we couldn't afford it, we would go and knock on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the people that still had a little money, and they would buy this coal from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And for that money we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and buy a little bit of flour, whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And that's how we lived for three long months. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We both were very ill, as you know, from disease and all kinds of indigestion and gastritis and typhoid fever; it was very prevalent, people lived under very inhuman circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">There was no proper food. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">My brother was nine years old, it was very difficult for me because he was in the growing stage and he did not understand all the things that are happening to us -- that we have to hide and we have to be beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">On January I believe 7th or 8th, the Germans surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> again and they took ---------- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">At that time there were still about 200,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I might be wrong with my numbers -- and then they took another 25,000 at that time and we had to hide 1n a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we closed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So it was just extremely difficult, it was just like the ----.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Why was your uncle -------------?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Because my uncle was not a nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Very simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  Who lived with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  His wife and a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">My uncle was an extremely intelligent, egoistic, self-centered person, who didn't get married until later in his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He spoke English in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He worked for the Joint Distribution Committee, he had a high position, but during the War when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was already the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> still had a lot of food from the peasants, my father would send -- we were allowed to send packages every week to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , a certain amount of food, and my father ------- supported him maybe a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But -- I don't want to talk bad about my relatives but he just didn't do anything for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He figured he wouldn't have enough money to survive for himself and he just practically threw us out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It was winter, it was a very heavy winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We didn't have proper clothes, we didn't have proper heat, we just sat in a corner with all these other people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And one week when the Germans surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we locked off a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to try to hide -- we were maybe 30 people in that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we were just eating raw cabbage and radishes, and whatever we could put into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- we had no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , just a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It was practically inhuman but otherwise the Germans would have found us. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So we blocked off one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> in front of it so the Germans would not know when they come into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">That's how we survived the deportation on January 7 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , because we had no papers that we are working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And then while we existed in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we were hearing rumors -- it was already 1943 -- that something 1s cooking there, that there might be an uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The Jews are buying the munitions from the Poles said something might happen, that maybe really Germans are going to liquidate the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And there were rumors that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is not going to exist any more because it was practically one of the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that the Germans kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So what was happening is that a lot of Jews who still had some means, they were building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Those <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> were not the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> that were built by the Underground but they were <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> that they https://collections.ushmm.org built to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They thought that maybe if they built these very excessive <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and put water here and cooking facilities, that maybe they can survive in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> if the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> gets destroyed for reason, either through the Jewish uprising or for any other reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And people who could contribute to go into those <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> were partaking in this whole idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Now, we didn't know anybody, we were absolutely orphans, we didn't know anybody there and we absolutely had no chance to ever think that we would be allowed to be taken into those <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was very sick, and after living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> over three months all of a sudden I just felt an urge of getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was just the opposite of what I thought three months ago -- three months before, I was outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I couldn't find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for myself and I said, "Let me die like all the other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">You get shot and it's all over with." </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We still didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But at that point -- it was spring, it was in February or March and I just felt an urge to be shut outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , not in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I just felt like I want some light and fresh air, and maybe I want to see normal living people for a while, and then if I go, it's different. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I just felt 1t. And maybe for the sake of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We just wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">First of all, you have to have the will, and then you have the opportunity, you know -- one without the other just doesn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And most of the Jews, and also us -- we had no will any more and that's why we came to this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But at this point we somehow got our strength together to get the will to maybe want to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But getting out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I don't even have an example of the impossibility to this idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">There just isn't such a thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">There's no such a thing that you can go to a 12-foot <span class="DLF">wall</span> , who surrounded by Germans, there's no such a thing that you get out and not be caught, because the whole area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was always patrolled by Poles who only waited for somebody to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We had no connections but we had an idea and we started to think that maybe we should pursue this idea: It just so happened that my husband was still working at the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">One day while he was there he saw saw a familiar face, the face of a man who was wearing a railroad uniform, and he was convinced that he knows this fellow and that he's a friend of his from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and that he's a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Slowly they started to look at each other and they recognized each other, and from a distance they said, [speaking in whisper] "Are you so-and-so" and he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he said, "I don't believe -- what are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="320">My husband said, "I'm in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , with my wife and her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">What are YOU doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He said, "Well, I'm pretending I'm a Polish railroad worker and I have a lot of connections, I live outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I have a lot of connections with Polish people who hide Jews for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But big money. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And my whole family is being hidden in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> inside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It just so happened that I knew the whole family and I also knew the friend of my husband, and he said, "Do you have any money? </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I can arrange for you to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="327">This doesn't mean -- his whole family was killed by the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And that doesn't mean that he himself survived, because he didn't, but he helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Because if you were hiding in 1943, that doesn't mean that you're going to make it for a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So, my husband said to him, "I have no money but we would like to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He said, "I know of a treasure that was buried in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I don't know exactly what treasure it was, you know, what was 1n it, but 1t was just a lot of things buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">My father was instrumental in putting a crate together and putting it into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="REGION">earth area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I would be willing to show somebody where this is, even go with them." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It was so dangerous to go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">This fellow said, "No https://collections.ushmm.org problem, we have Polish uniforms, we have Polish papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I'm going to talk to my Polish friends and see if they would be willing to go and get this treasure out and get you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So that was just the beginning of the dream, because he came back in a few more days and my husband saw him and he said, "Well, they would be willing. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">There's a whole group of people that would be willing to take you back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and see if the treasure 1s really there." </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But my husband said to him, "You know, the way things look here, something is going to happen any day and I might just come back with all that money and treasure and my wife and her brother might be killed by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">If I am taken out to go for this treasure, I would like them to come with me at least out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and wait some <span class="NPIP">place</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> until this all materializes." </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And that's exactly what happened, that miracle happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">That one day he came back to the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> and he said, "Dead on that date, at six in the morning, you come out with a group of workers and I will have two Polish people standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and pretending, when you just walk through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and you walk and walk and then you walk away from the group, I'm going to have these people pretend that they grab you. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They're going to grab you and they will take you on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> we are staying." </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And that's exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">The three of us went out in the morning, we went through this <span class="DLF">gate</span> and these two young people came up to us and grabbed us and took us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And there was the miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I think we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about two weeks before the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Because while I was on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> already, I saw the ghetto burning and I heard all the remarks that the Polish people said because of the ghetto burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They were kind of happy, some were. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Of course the people that helped us, I must say, we had a lot of help from certain Polish people and we were taken to a family of an engineer who was from the Underground and who kept me and my brother until my husband and the whole group -- they arranged a whole group to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They were prepared for all the adversities and they would arrange to take for this treasure, they gave him a uniform, a ----- uniform, and while they were gone I was waiting with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There were some other Jewish people that this engineer, this Polish Underground person, kept in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> temporarily until these people were found <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> where they could hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Well, they came back, and what happened was: First they came back when the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was frozen, so they couldn't dig. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Then they went back ten days later and they were digging under very unusual circumstances -- the <span class="DLF">shaft</span> that it was buried in was going under the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they had to pretend that they measure the <span class="DLF">street</span> and do all kinds of repairs and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And to make the story short, they found the case was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And that really saved our life, because otherwise these people would think that we were lying, that it was simply a trick to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but this whole case with all the things was buried was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was broken up and empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  The uprising happened -- let's go back to the time of the uprising, which is also the time that your husband was going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , or he went back first and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Then he came back, and then he went back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Tell me how the uprising fit into all of this and where he learned where he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  Well, actually I personally have no experience of the uprising because we were fortunate enough to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> maybe two weeks prior to the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">What we knew was there was great preparations. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Everything was very secretive and we knew they were preparing https://collections.ushmm.org <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> ; we knew that they were buying a lot of ammunition <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , from the Poles, because that was the sources that the Jews were buying ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We knew that things were going to happen, we knew that there's preparations, but because we got out about ten days before, I really have no knowledge of actually what happened, except from what I was reading I only can tell you that when we were outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we stayed not far away -- of course the burning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> could be seen from miles and miles away and when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started it was just one glob of fire, you could see that all this <span class="REGION">area</span> was burning and a lot of <span class="DLF">streets</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were cordoned off. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">There was police, and there was German police and Polish police and you could not even <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> and everything got stuck at a certain point because you could not get through because of the flame and because of the shooting and because of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So the life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> per se was completely disrupted and I can be witness to this because I lived outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as an Aryan and I was moving, I wasn't hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">At any time I was out, moving, so I unfortunately heard remarks from people that was very favorable to what was happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And of course I pretend no reaction but I was very hurt about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  With what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  Like things that the Jews are burning. "</span><span class="sentence" id="372">Now we're going to get rid of all the bedbugs," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Things that weren't very pleasant to me to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And yet there were Poles who helped me and kept me, right now, waiting for me to get my way through with arranging my life on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But what was happening in there, I absolutely -- I mean I have an idea but I was not witness to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Because we stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> from November 11 through maybe end of March or beginning of April; that was the extent of our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We witnessed the last days of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> per se but we were not part of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I can not give information on that from what I --
QUESTION:  When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was burning and there was a lot of gunfire, were you afraid, living as a gentile or in hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Well, I was always afraid living as a gentile in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Every day and every minute I was always very vulnerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">My living as a gentile consisted of having a piece of paper which I somehow secured or was secured for me and I had to pretend to be that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But I have to digress back to the fact that when my husband came back and I was still with these people that kept me for about two weeks, and when he came back and when it turned out that there's no money in there, he was able to bring a little, a few things like, I think, two fur coats that his parents left with some gentile people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , and we planned to sell maybe two suitcases with clothes, -- everything on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> was of value, and we planned to sell this. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And at that time, these people that we stayed with, who were part of the Polish underground, told us that even so now there is no money to find us a secure <span class="NPIP">place</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they would not advise us or they don't want us to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Because they know things are going to happen there very soon and if we go back there it will be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So they would be willing to help us somehow establish ourselves on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> : meaning that we have no money to go into somebody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , pay for being https://collections.ushmm.org kept but that somehow I will have to find my way, maybe with their help, to establish my existence on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> ; meaning that they helped me obtain a false identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">There were priests in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> that were selling birth certificates of somebody more or less the same age as I was of people that died and maybe their death wasn't registered properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I could obtain a birth certificate of that person and therefore I would assume the identity of that person, and if I would have a real birth certificate from a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , I could go to a <span class="BUILDING">German office</span> which issues -- there was a camp called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">-------,</span> it was like a passport and everybody had to have that -- and I can obtain, if I have enough guts I can obtain which I would need to show them that I'm an Aryan. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Which really I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">This what happened: they were helping me to try to maintain my identity as an Aryan, and I went to this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I got my paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So I became this Lieutenant Viyeska (ph) who actually was three or four years older than I was but I had to assume her birth date; I was her. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I had to completely unlearn, psychologically, of what happened of who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I had to be learning prayers, I had to be going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , I had to mingle with Polish people, but my problem was that I had my family with me and I have to find a way for them to survive too. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">What happened was that --
QUESTION:  And you were successful because you didn't look Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Because I didn't look Jewish, because I didn’t speak -- at my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">My Polish was very proper -- there's all kinds of Polish and they can detect and recognize you right away, the Poles -- my language was proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I was a girl, they could not recognize me where my husband -- only Jewish males were circumcised in Europe, and immediately anybody, whether it was a little Pole that's 16 years old and wants your watch, or whether it's a German, if they take in the corner, you're being recognized immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And that's why men were so handicapped in hiding; it was much easier for women. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Now, my brother was also circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Although he was very blond, with blue eyes, and he absolutely had no Semitic features but he was circumcised, and he could not play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with little children because he had a very sad look on his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">He knew that he doesn't have a mother and father and it was very difficult for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Therefore, he had to be hiding, together with my husband, in order to play safe with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So I had to be able to secure a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to live and a way to bring groceries for more people than just myself without being detected. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And between 1943 April until October '44 there was a lot of different circumstances and a lot of things were going on on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">By then of course they cleaned up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was over with but it took a long time but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was burning, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was completely surrounded -- you know, it was cut off from the <span class="REGION">ghetto side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But I had a multitude of problems, because first of all I had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I wasn't even thinking of going to work at that time, because work was scarce, and I was really scared, I mean, I still was myself, with my past, and with all my sensitivities and everything that I -- you can't just switch yourself off, I wasn't a -----, I was a vulnerable young girl who all of a sudden had all these problems to take care of and all these burdens. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Well, at the beginning this engineer who was very, very nice helped me secure a tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there was another lady who also wanted to live with me and we both rented a tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">In this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we built a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for her husband, my husband and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">The neighbors were never supposed to know that there's more than two people https://collections.ushmm.org living there, me and her, and we were supposed to go to work in the morning and come back at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So these people had to be so quiet -- not flushing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , not walking, because we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> and there was, you know, people living on the bottom and on top of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And it was very, very difficult, it was touch and go all the time, and every day you hear that they found some Jews here and they found some Jews there, and there were Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that didn't be discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">There was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We managed for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I had to go shopping to different <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> so that I wouldn't bring too much food, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But that only was for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">After about six or seven months, the janitor -- they were always attuned to what was going on -- kind of went after me one day when I was shopping and he kind of understood that I'm buying more food than I should, and he denounced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But we had certain things figured out at that time and my husband built with his bare fingers a hiding place which was a bombed-out part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was on the part of the ruins. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So what they did is they put some boards there so from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> it looked like ruins but from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> it connected to our little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And there was the side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> where they could sit there all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was very cleverly disguised: it was an <span class="DLF">entrance</span> from the -- actually where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> is there was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and the <span class="DLF">wall</span> had wooden blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now, one of those big wooden panels would slide up and there would be the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So at night they would come out and sleep with us, but during the way they would go in there and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> you couldn't see anything because these panels were all the same all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Anyway, they also figured out that in case I go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I get it trouble and they make me come back to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they would have a way -- I would have a certain knock or talk very loud and they would have a way to break through the <span class="DLF">outside wall</span> of that <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> which went out on the ruins and they would all run and they would tell me where they go -- we had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I could find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And the inevitable happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">One morning I went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and the janitor came up to me with two policemen, Polish policemen, and they said, "Well, we heard that you are hiding Jews" -- the other lady was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then -- "we know that there are Jews here and we know that you are hiding Jews and this is not right, we have to go in and take a look of what is going on there." </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I told them that there is nobody there and I told them that I lost my key, I couldn't find it -- because I didn't want to open up with the key, I really want to give them the signal, this knock where they would know to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I told them that I don't have the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They were going to bring a locksmith to break 1n the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they did break in the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">By the time they broke in the <span class="DLF">door</span> there was nobody there, they were gone; I mean they didn't even find the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They just looked around the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there was just nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And we always kept it nice and tidy, just like two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But they were just very upset because they didn't find anything and they told me that they're going to come back at four o'clock because they have to investigate and blah blah blah whatever they wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Well, they took my papers and that was the problem, because right away they ask you who you are, and when you give them the papers then if they don't give them back to you, then you're dead, you have no papers, that's terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Well, 1n the meantime I went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were and I told them what happened, and I said, "Look" -- it was only a temporary <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the day or two -- and I said, "Look, I don't know what to do now -- should I go back and face the music and get the papers back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And I felt strong enough that https://collections.ushmm.org I really want to go and face up to them, because I really wanted my papers back. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And what happened was that I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- of course I had everything in there -- and they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So they never came back and I never got my papers back. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was no good any more, we could not return to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So we had to move out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And at this point, this other friend of mine, she had to go her own way and I had to go my own way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  Now, I just want to go back and ask you one question. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">When you didn't have the money to pay the Polish underground for getting you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or the Polish people, your friends, how come they still helped you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  Because in my path of life I found some very nice Polish people who maybe did not adore Jews but who from humane reasons felt compelled to help, who really could not live seeing all these atrocities that are being done and who felt that they maybe have to do a little bit to help the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I met actually three people like that in my <span class="DLF">path</span> and they were very important people to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">This one fellow who kept us at the beginning and who said to us, "Don't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I have no gain for you going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I know you didn't lie, and if you can support yourself and establish yourself on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , then if I can help you I will help you." </span><span class="sentence" id="448">He did help me secure this first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , you see, he did help me in giving me a little encouragement and showing me maybe how I can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So there was the first thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Then later on, when they took my papers and when I was completely lost and I was at a point where I just didn't know what to do with myself and the war still was nowhere towards the end, I went to visit a friend of mine who was also hiding and there is a story to it, if I have a little time I will tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">While I had this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , the gentleman who helped me, he was helping other Jews getting established on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , and if he had to bring three or four Jews, he couldn't keep them in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he would bring them to my little <span

helping him at that time, and at some point I could have had seven or eight people in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And that's where this janitor really got the idea that something's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But once this was over with, they all had to go their own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">While I had this little <span

id="457">She said, "I need a big favor of you: I need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for my husband to sleep for two nights, he's going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and we don't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> right now, so can he sleep by you for two nights?" </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I said, "Look, what's the difference if we sleep together on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Let him come." </span><span class="sentence" id="460">He came to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he left a winter coat, he forgot his winter coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">A few days letter I get a little letter from her telling me that he needs the coat and if I don't mind to bring the coat to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she 1s at this moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Well, on one Sunday I decided that I'm going to take the coat to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That was a heavy winter coat on my arm and a purse and I got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And they stole my purse. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So that was on top of not having my papers, they stole my purse with my money and by the time I got to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with the coat I was 1n very desperate mood, I was ready to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I said, "Now I have nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I have a husband that's sitting and waiting for me, I have a brother that is sitting and waiting for me that I have to support, and now I don't even have a paper any more and I don't have any money and I don't know what I'm going to do with myself." </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And I came in there crying https://collections.ushmm.org terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And there was a man sitting there and he looked at me -- he was the one who would be instrumental to take this man to a gentleman who would take my friend's husband to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> -- and he looks at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He says, "My God, what's the matter with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You're so young, you can't be so desperate." </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I said, "Look, right now I have no means of survival and I'm at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> which I can't cross." </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And he said to me, "You know you look very well, you look like an Aryan, why don't you want to work a little?" </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I said, "Work? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">What can I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="476">He said, "I can get a job for you and I can help you out, so don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">If you need some money, I'm going to hand you some money and if you want me to go with you to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where they give the documents" -- because I lost my purse, my purse was stolen -- he said, "I'm going to take you on Monday and I'm going to say that you are my cousin, and I'm going to tell them that they stole your purse on the so-and-so <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and they have to give you a duplicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">As simple as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And then you come to me and I will tell you what you're going to be doing for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So that was my guardian angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He actually met me that day, my girl friend ------ took the coat and went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He met me and he took me to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and he told them this story and I got a copy of my original passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And the next day he gave me an address, he told me where I should go and he told me that he is hiding about 20 Jews in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that these Jews have no means of supporting themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He was a single man. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I would say he was 1n the 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">He was a past pilot in the Polish air force, he has been wounded many times, was not 1n the best of health. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">A great humanitarian, who kept on saying, "I don't like Jews but I have to help you." </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And these people that were living in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- I don't know how they got to him but they needed some means of survival and they knew how to manufacture -- I mean this 1s bizarre -- how to make certain things that could be sold on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and they couldn't get out to sell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They were looking for somebody who could go out and sell this for them so that they can survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And that person was, he found me in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I said, "Well, I have to talk to my husband, I don't think that he would want me to walk around <span class="NPIP">places</span> like open- air markets and <span class="BUILDING">flea markets</span> and sell stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">He would probably be worried, you know, that they recognize me." </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He said, "You go and talk to him." </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Well, when I talked to my husband he wasn't very much for it, but we really had no choice, we were three people that had to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I went to him every morning and he gave me a little suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">What these people were manufacturing was hairnets. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">There was a great fashion at that time of heavy nets -- I think in the 40s they had them here too -- they were all different colors and you were wearing them like down from your head to cover your hair and they were like brown and gray and all kinds of colors; heavy, knit, made by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And these Jews had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> some <span class="NPIP">place</span> before the War and they knew how to do it manually. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And then they were also making elastics, they knew how to make elastics. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They would cut the thread from the inner tubes by hand and then they would take some silk, dye the silk different colors and they would make round little elastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">When you buy a piece of round elastic that's what they were doing by hand, putting it on little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cardboards</span> and putting a label around it; and of course there was nothing like that because all the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And they wanted to sell it and they could manufacture a lot of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So I got a little suitcase and they told me where to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">The place I went was a <span class="BUILDING">flea market</span> , the biggest one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , where the worst element of people were selling, I mean the lowest from the lowest, people that would not hesitate to chop you up in pieces if they would know who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">But somehow, I don't know, I had the https://collections.ushmm.org courage because I had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I wasn't a hero, by no means, I did it for my own survival and I did it because I had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And [laughing] I developed a very nice business. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I was liked by the people, I got my own clients and own customers, and they were giving me orders, they were selling, they were giving me orders for more. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I would put my orders with them and they would fill my orders and that was going on like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And then one day this engineer said to me, "You know, why don't we teach your husband," who was sitting and doing nothing, "why don't I take him over there and we'll train him and we'll teach him how to do it so he can do it too, rather than sitting at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And what happened was that he actually learned how to do it, and I was selling our own merchandise and the merchandise of the other people, and that's how we all had a chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I have to mention that by then I had another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">This <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was not my own but through somebody I found a lady who was willing to share her very small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with me but I had to pay her more than more than usual -- this lady needed money, she was a widow, and she tried to survive; she was peddling a little bit merchandise here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And then she said that we could have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in one of her <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and that we could -- I would pay her, for instance, if normally she would take 50 or 100 dollars from another Polish person, she took 800 from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">She really did it for the money but she was a person that had a lot of heart and understanding for me but she really needed the money, it meant surviving for her too. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">She had to pay for the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and she had expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So at that point we lived with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Of course my husband was still in hiding and nobody knew that he was there and he also made a little hiding in the an ------- which I'm going to let him tell you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And we lived with that lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  And you were able to make enough money to --
ANSWER:  I was able to make enough money to pay her. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I was able to make enough money for us to eat well and I was also able to make enough money to save. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Because when the Polish uprising in 1944 happened, of which part my mentor was very much involved with and he was one of the officers in the uprising, I did a saving that I tried to locate somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Now, what I didn't mention that I lost my brother in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">It's a very painful thing to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">In July -- was it 1943? </span><span class="sentence" id="526">yes, in July he was sitting in that hiding with my husband, this other man, and he really had a very, very poor life because he couldn't play -- you know, it's hard to confine a nine-year-old to a poor little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , also he was wonderful, he was so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But I knew that this situation can't go on like this, he wasn't eating properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">At that time I didn't work yet, which was in the old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and one day I found out that there is such a thing as a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I don't know how much information there is in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> about this particular thing that I'm going to talk about but I would like to know because I can tell about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It was a scheme from the Germans, it was called <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Polski</span> that was was an old fancy <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and what the Germans did, they spread rumors that they're going to send people to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and that these Jews were going to be exchanged for German prisoners of war with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and they were looking for Jews to come to this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and they will transport these Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Actually they took one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and sent them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And now the people thought that this is a legitimate thing and everybody that was in hiding- because you see the Jews that were hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and paying all this money for https://collections.ushmm.org hiding eventually the money goes out, eventually these people get more tired and tired of keeping the Jews, eventually there is more people that 1s being discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It's a very vulnerable situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">These Jews had no assurance that they're going to survive and the matter of fact everybody that we know and the family ------------, everybody is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Sooner or later somehow from many <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and from many <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> these people were found and kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So, when the rumor was spread that there is such a thing as this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , people jumped at it and it was very hard to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Matter of fact, the Germans even had a way to take money from these Jews, so that it was really kept up beautiful and the people that was supposed to leave in two weeks were living there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I met the girl who was from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , whom I knew very well and she used to be a neighbor of ours and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with her younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Because when she saw me, she said, "Oh my God, what are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And she was dressed beautiful, she was a beautiful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I said, "Well, we're in hiding and I can't get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and I don't know what to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="542">She said, "Oh my God, I'll be happy to help you." </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It turned out that she was the mistress of the man who was arranging all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and she told me, "You know, I can help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">If you want to send your brother with me, I promise you that I'm going to take care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I remember my little brother and I remember he was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with you and if you want to send him with me, I'll take care of him" She said, "Were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I'm going out tomorrow to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span> -- I need some very fancy clothes, and I know all these people here and I know there's a group of students going. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And if you want me to, I'll take care of him." </span><span class="sentence" id="547">She was crying, she says, "I lost my family, I lost my brother, and I promise you that I'm going to take care of him." </span><span class="sentence" id="548">She did not know the truth of what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Now, that was something I couldn't refuse, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I said to my husband, "Look, we can't go, here there's still a long time to the end of the war, who knows what's going to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">People are paying thousands of dollars in foreign currency to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I met people, I talked to people that were actually getting out of hiding, paying in money to go; and they believed in it." </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Who was I to think that it's not so? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I was only sorry that we couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And we talked it over, I went and I bought a suitcase and I bought some clothes for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We were supposed to meet on a certain day and I was supposed to take him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And the morning when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was leaving -- incidentally, one of my relatives, my aunt, and her little girl also was there, and also ------ with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> because she knew somebody who was arranging for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And that's what it happened, it was in July '43 that I lost him. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I took him there in the morning, and I saw her leave with him in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> , I said goodbye to him, I said goodbye to her, she promised me she's going to take care of him, she was sincere about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I saw all the people go in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to the ------- wherever they were going to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , we said goodbye, he told me he's going to write to me, and that was the end I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Later, through the Polish underground paper it was mentioned that they took all the people from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and they took them to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , where they didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And also, the rest of the people that lived there and waited for the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> were also taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So, my brother would have been now 60 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So that's how I lost him, and there were just the two of us from then. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So at the time where I found this man who gave me a job, and when I was working and having the money and being able to support myself, there was just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So that what was going on more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I was working, and my husband was making whatever he could, and I was selling, and we https://collections.ushmm.org were living quietly because nobody knew about his existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And I lived with that lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">We had a few close encounters, for instance, her drunken cousin wanted to come and sleep over one night and my husband had to go in hiding and the hiding was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , he passed out in there, it was just terrible; I think that maybe he will throw more details on this particular situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And that's how we lived, quietly, incognito, till about shortly 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I have to tell you that this engineer, whose name is Selek -----sky (ph), he has been honored with a gold medal from the Israeli Government and his is the first place in the Valley of the Righteous that these people established, because most of those people survived the Warsaw uprising, not the ghetto uprising, the other uprising, he got them all out ------. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And there were rumors that he was killed I read, but then he did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">He really was honored by the Jews who are living now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and by the State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He also had a few close encounters. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">For instance, there was a woman that was in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was ready to deliver a baby and he did not know about it, she was apparently camouflaging it. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And in the last minute when she ----- the baby, he had to call a doctor whom he had to pay dearly and they didn't have the money, so he ran over to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the morning screaming, "I need 3000 zlotys immediately, this woman is having a baby in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So we gave it to him and she did have the baby, and apparently they put it right up to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ; but I understand that she survived and they got the baby back. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So I was not in fact with these people after the war but I know that most of them survived and live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It wasn't until 1944 when he came over one day to us -- he was coming quite often to us because he was lonely; and he was telling us that there's going to be an uprising, a Polish uprising, in October 1944, that the Polish people are beginning an uprising because the Russians are coming closer, and the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> is now on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> which was dividing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> into two parts: there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> on one side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> and on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> , and what was happening that the Russian army was advancing up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> and there were rumors that they're going to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">In the meantime the Polish Government in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> decided that there's going to be a Polish uprising, that the Polish people will try to save <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> from being occupied by the Russians and they're going to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So these were these people, who were organized who had munitions, but they were against a German army with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> with all kinds of bombs, and they tried to stake an uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And he told us about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">He said, "I want to warn you that there's going to be an uprising and things are going to be tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I want you to prepare food, and if you have any money, money's going to be no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So I want you to go and do something with it." </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I said, "What would I do with the money I have?" </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He said, "Why don't you go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy some rings." </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So here I went to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and ended up with eleven wedding bands and that was my treasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So of course the uprising was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We were both severely wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The second week of the uprising took about four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">350,000 people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Three-quarters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was destroyed; that's why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> is all rebuilt now because three-quarters of it was destroyed by the Germans because of the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They were coming in systematically and bombing all the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because they knew there's this new cry of underground here; and the Polish underground killed a number of Germans, but still 1t was no comparison of what the Germans had done and the Germans could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So it was terrible, it was a very, very terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">At night my husband used to go to work and help them save some grain from burning <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> because the population was https://collections.ushmm.org starving and the Germans were having a feast, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Some of them were being killed but still they had a hold on the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We had to go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, because the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I lived with this lady they were bombing every day and at one point we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and we saw some other Jews creep out from another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But at that point we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the Poles and the Jews, so at that point nobody really had time to care who was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , who was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And that was going on for two or three weeks until one day our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was destroyed and that's where I was buried in debris completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">My husband just pulled me out by a leg and I sustained permanent injury to my ear, and my husband was also injured at the same time and we had to move to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> still <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and we waited until in October 1944 the uprising was completely over, it was suppressed, and the Germans decided to evacuate the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">The Russians waited patiently while the Poles and the Germans were killing each other -- they were in no hurry at that point, they knew they've got the situation covered and they can come in any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So they suspended, you know, the quest for maybe three or four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">They sat on the other part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> , and mind you, the Jews that were fighting in that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> were already liberated and some people were trying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> , under the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , to swim through in order to be liberated; and here we knew that within seven or eight kilometres from where we were these people were already free and we still had the Germans, and God knows what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So it was really a terrible situation because at that time half of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was already taken by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">The provisional government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was established in 1944 in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , and we were still heavy under the Germans, dying every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">When the Germans decided to evacuate all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , we had no choice but to leave, and at that point we didn't know where they're going to take us and what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We knew that the war is going to end soon because ---------- artillery and we knew it's a matter of months but we were still under the Germans and we had no choice but to go with them whatever they're going to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So that's what happened: we were evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , everybody had to leave, all the Poles, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But there was an aura of thinking that whoever is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> 1s somehow connected to the uprising, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The Poles all over the <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> thought that we were all from the uprising, that we were all from the underground, and especially being wounded and being hurt, they didn't really think there would be some Jews among us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So at that point we somehow managed, and my husband too, to get through with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Also, at that time we were all taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krushkupf</span> (ph), it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and that was a gigantic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> that's where all the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And from there they were doing selections: the young people that were healthy were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work for <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , the old people we didn't know what they're going to do with them but this was the petrifying moment of my life, because we were never separate, we always managed to be together; you know, like families, and husband and wife, were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Up on this point we always managed to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Now, at this point we were kind Hof scared because I was afraid that if they take him to work to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we will have to go to a doctor to see if he's healthy and then they're going to find out who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So we were really in a limbo. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And then we were walking into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> not knowing really what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">While we https://collections.ushmm.org were walking in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there were nuns there -- I don't know what they were doing, I don't know if they were helping to evacuate the Poles, and one of the nuns walked up to us and said, "Why don't you go the right? </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It's ----- the wife to go to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Go to the right, don't ask any questions, go to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> named C." And you know, we didn't know if we should or not, but we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Once we got to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , it turned out this was <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> of sick people and when we walked in there they told us, "Oh you're not sick enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We've got some paint, we're going to make you bleed all over, we're going to put bandages on your head, we're going to put bandages on your knee, we're going to make you look real sick." </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So here we're sitting in this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , which was just terrible with a <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> for a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and with gigantic-size lice on the mats. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And this was just only a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> and we're asking the people, "What's going on here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="626">There were maybe 400 or 500 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Said, "We don't know, this is supposed to be sick <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , either they're going to send us some <span class="NPIP">place</span> to get better or they're going to take us some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and kill us because they don't need us." </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So that's where we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We sat there overnight, and then in the morning they took us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , the whole <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and they took us towards <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">There was no patrol on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , there was no guards on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and we really didn't know, we were very disoriented, it was like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> , we were 40, 50 people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But every time they stop, you could really go down; but where we going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We were afraid we're going to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and soon enough they're going to find who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So we didn't care any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Some people were getting off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- they were all Poles, mind you- some people were staying in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Somehow we decided to go to the end and see what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And in about, I don't know, a day and a half or so, we arrived at the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and we found out that what they're going to do with all of us is to put us with peasants -- each peasant of t his <span class="REGION">area</span> will have to take a Warsaw family and keep them there in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So we ended up in a very small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , with some quite poor peasants who took us in thinking that we are Warsaw underground fighters, and because we really were wounded -- and my husband developed hepatitis here -- they really thought that we are legit and it didn't come to their minds to think that we are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So this is October 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We stayed with these peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Some of them were kind, some of them weren't, but if they weren't kind it wasn't because they were Jews, they got once kind because they had to share with other people whatever they had but some of them were very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It was bitter cold winter, they made me a little fur coat from rabbits hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">They were very poor peasant and we had to work for them and do everything in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and with the animals and with the pigs and whatever had to be done, you know, with the <span class="DLF">well</span> , with the water; very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">They put up four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and a sack for us to sleep at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">In the daytime we needed the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because everything was in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a lot of children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But somehow we managed to get their confidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday, and at Christmas it was very difficult because the Polish people had a ceremonial Christmas Eve and we were invited to this [she laughs] to a very important person there, you know, for Christmas dinner and I had to pretend that I am really very sick and cannot make it at the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So 1t was touch and go, and because there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the children, my husband established a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , for which the peasants were very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And somehow they kept us there and we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">It doesn't mean that there wasn't rumors every day when they found a family some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , hiding, and that they https://collections.ushmm.org chopped them up to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">This was just like daily news. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But somehow we survived this ordeal too. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">In the beginning of January, when the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> was coming closer, we were liberated by the Russians, and that was the greatest that could ever happen to us -- to see the first Russian soldier come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was just like seeing Messiah. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We still had to pretend that we're not so happy, because the Polish people did not like the idea that the Russians are coming, and the anti-Communists especially, they did not want <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to take over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we had to kind of be very diplomatic about it and, you know, really keep it cool and now to show it how happy we are that the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And as the Russians were coming in, we saw Germans beheaded, we saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full of Germans with no heads, I mean they were really getting it from the Katyusha and from the artillery of the Russians coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And we slowly had to convince the Russians that we are Jews, they didn't believe us; because we needed certain permits to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , things were very difficult at that time you know -- people could not just move around, the Russians were still advancing, it was still January 1945, the war wasn't over till actually May. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">But we wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we didn't want to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">My husband had a very close encounter with a Russian who told him, "I don't think you're a Jew, I think you're a spy, there's no more Jews here, we know that Hitler killed them all." </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And my husband says to him, "Listen, is there any Russian soldier here that maybe knows Yiddish? </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I know a little Yiddish." </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So they found a little guy and this guy came over and says, in Russian -- my husband speaks some Russian - "You think you're a Jew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So: tell me a Jewish prayer." </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And he said, "Geshmah" (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">They started to kiss and embrace. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And that's how slowly we told the peasants that we have to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , we didn't tell them anything else, we want to see what's going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And we said goodbye to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And mostly on foot we started our migration back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Of course we didn't find anybody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Later on we went back to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we took some clothes and things for the children, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">---------------[proper mames] never found out who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Now, my husband developed hepatitis and we didn't want him to go to the doctor --

<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  -- and I think we should put up another roll, maybe a shorter roll. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Do you think you can End of Tape #2 https://collections.ushmm.org Tape #3
ANSWER:  Okay, I would like to just mention briefly an incident that while we lived with these peasants, my husband became gravely ill and he developed hepatitis. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He was really in very bad shape and almost dying, and he refused to go to a doctor, because he was afraid that being examined, the doctor is going to find out who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">But he was already so ill that the peasants would absolutely don't take no for an answer, and we had to go 13 kilometers in the winter in the snow to get to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a doctor, where they were very helpful, because they wanted my husband to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They dressed him up very warm and they took a couple of horses and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , and then we went to this doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">As we walked into the <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span> , my husband noticed that he had a little plague there which said that he was a railroad doctor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">My husband walked into him and he says, "Oh, you're doctor so- and-so. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I remember you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I used to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> too." </span><span class="sentence" id="682">They shook hands and they became friends right away, and actually when he needed a shot, he had the nurse just do it for him, and he did not really examine him. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So there was a little close encounter which I wanted to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Well, to make my story a little more concise, we went back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">There was some Jews coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and some Jews coming back from Polish, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but unfortunately we found out that there was nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">My husband found some uncles there, and he will tell about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We did not want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I felt that every stone had blood on it, and every <span class="DLF">wall</span> had memories for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I never went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my parents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I went back to the lady who send the Gestapo for me, and I really wanted, went to the police to talk to them about it, and to see if she can be reprimanded. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">But they told me there was no witnesses, so we just let it go. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Only God was my witness at that time, but it ended up well for me, so I'm alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We went to live in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because my husband wanted to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He had too his <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> behind him. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So we found out that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , which became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Broslof</span> (ph), there is a <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and that his professors from the previous <span class="BUILDING">school</span> will be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">He had no documents and no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">He was accepted to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> for the third year and we spend a year there. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">That we also belonged to Acubootz (ph) there, that was Acubootz (ph) of students. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And after he completed the third year and he could secure papers, we decided to go into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We absolutely didn't want to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">The memories were just too terrible, and there was an opportunity to leave into the unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We just took a knapsack and went to the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and then into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We were aided by the Breha (ph), by the Israeli officials who were helping Jews get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time, and we just went into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We were fortunate to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> my husband was able to continue <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> at that time, and we became a part of a group of 400 Jewish students who came from all over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and who were able to study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">The reason that the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was lenient to those people is because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was occupied by all four, and the Americans made sure that Jewish students were not only accepted at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , but they also paid very, very low tuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Well, anti-Semitism was great, and the German professors were not that happy to promote Jewish students, but people still studied there and my husband was able to get his medical diploma there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We stayed there for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I was working a little bit, and I decided to also to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">After I https://collections.ushmm.org was at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> for two years, he was ready with his <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , and we couldn't wait to get out, because we secured some papers to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from a distant family that I found and who were very gracious to send us papers, but they told us not to come before my husband is ready with his studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So four years later, on October 1950, we were brought into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and from then on we felt free, we felt happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">We were young enough to want to start a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We were young enough to try to cut off the past as much as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We decided that this is our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we are going to live here, there's not going back, there's no complaining we have to become American citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We have to take the opportunity that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has given us. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">My husband has a good profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I felt that I didn't finish my studies, so when the children grew up a little bit, I went back to get my degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">We were fortunate to have things fall into <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , where my husband was interning, then we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for a short while, and then we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> where we build our life practically from scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">But we were fortunate that we were able to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We have a great family. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Our nuclear family was two, then it became four, and now we are 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So we did a good job, a very close-knit family, our family is now substituting for the family we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">We are very fortunate to have great children. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">They are married, three granddaughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And I feel that we build our lives and we were able to project to the children a normal set of values, not trying to burden them with our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">However, they have to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They were maybe always more sensitive to us because they knew that that's all we have is them. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">They are very attentive. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And except for the bad memories, I don't think that I have much of a stigma of really what happened now, because I still was 18 and 20 years old when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I think that when you're older and when you have more of the past on you, like previous marriages and children that you lost, it's much harder to adjust in your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">But I must say that I adjusted to the life here very well, and embraced life for whatever it could offer me. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Tried to compensate for lost time and my lost youth, and grateful to God that it all happened that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  I want to ask you a couple of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You lived for a long time Azonarian (ph) Tell me what that ended up doing for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  Well, living Azonarian (ph) actually didn't do anything for me, because the way I was brought up, I always knew who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">My family was not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">My father was the founder of a Zionist youth movement in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I always knew who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I always had holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> where Hebrew was taught everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I was among Jewish people, Jewish friends, and I always knew who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I could have never lost my identity, and I was fortunate to marry somebody of my own faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Now, just to give you an example, I had friends, who at my age, 14, 15, were also in the same situation that I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">But they somehow found Polish mates, who maybe at that time were helping them to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">They never went back to Judaism or went back to being Jewish, and I cannot, I'm not the judge for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I cannot blame them for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But this is what happened to many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">This is what happened to a lot of males who married Gentile women, who were helping them and stayed in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and are raising Gentile families. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">That happens to women that encountered the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Some broke off and some stayed at the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So I was just fortunate always to know who I was, and to be able to share my life with a person https://collections.ushmm.org who was of my own faith, and therefore it was never any question for me to be anything else but a Jew, because my parents instilled that in me, and because there was just not a way for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It was just that everything else was just done out of need. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">If I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , it meant nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">If I had to be arrogant, it meant nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">To me it was only a means of survival, and I was fortunate enough not to have to continue this falsehood and get back to myself to be whoever I am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  And when you lived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Azonarian</span> (ph) you learned a lot about anti-Semitism, that you think you otherwise wouldn't have learned.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  Tell me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  Yeah, this is very unfortunate, because I lived Azonarian through the two years during the war, and also for a certain time when we were liberated, I did not want to go back to my Jewish name until I left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , for cowardly reasons, I did not trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">There were programs after the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , there were programs all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">There was a lot of hatred, and I didn't want to survive the war and then something happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">For instance, I always telling my husband that if we live in Europe and I have a child and it's going to be male, I would never circumcise that child, because of my brother, who I think I lost because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I had certain feelings and certain stigma. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">After the war, I encountered a lot of anti- Semitism, I mean sayings like, for instance, "Oh, look at this Jew on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Hitler didn't kill them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Here they're getting out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Here we have them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We thought that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is going to be without Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So, I couldn't help but hearing all that, and that just made me feel very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I could not say anything, because I still did not want anybody to know that I was Jewish up until we left, and then, of course, my husband came back to his own name, because he had to have false papers too, just in case they catch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And then, of course, as soon as we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we became students we decided that we absolutely want our name back and we wanted to be who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And that's why, you know, everything went back to our name. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Our kept my first name because it was so hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I was so attuned to it already, and there was just me, you know, between the age of 16 or 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I was just so used to it already, that I modified it a little bit and kept my Hebrew name as a middle name, and just stayed with that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But it's very unfortunate that I have to say that, but this is the very truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  I don't have anymore questions for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Do you have anything you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  Well, I feel that probably this interview will be completed was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">If I omitted things, it's because it's very hard to concise six years of tortures and trouble into a small amount of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I tried to be as exact as I could, and my memory still serves me so that I can remember events more or less, dates and at that point I think I was quite precise in telling the story the way it really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I'm grateful to have this opportunity to say it, and to put it on tape for posterity. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I always think of my grandchildren being able to press a button and see their https://collections.ushmm.org grandparents tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I feel that there's a great need of these things to be known, because of certain people that deny the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I am very grateful that I had this opportunity to do so, and I hope it will never happen again, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> will never have to face up to anything so horrible that the Holocaust was. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I thank you very much.</span></p>
