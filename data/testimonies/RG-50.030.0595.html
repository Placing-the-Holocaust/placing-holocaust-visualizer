ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Absolutely. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1">break] So Mr. Friedman, you just told us what year you were born, and I’d be curious to know what your parents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">What — what did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My father was a shoe designer, working on ladies’ shoes, and he worked for, initially, as far as I remember, for a <span class="BUILDING">Czech shoe factory</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bachia(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="4">This was in the 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">But then, with the depression, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> f-folded up and he went into the leather business, selling supplies to <span class="BUILDING">shoe repair shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And it was a — I imagine, a-as a child I really didn’t appreciate the — the difficulty that — that it was for him to earn a living, but we managed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Now, what did your mother do? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Did she stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  No, she was a housekeeper, and there were three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And my grandmother, and of course my parents, we all lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was October 17, 2010 about a — consisted of about two and a half <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">A-And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> — all six of us slept in that one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , but I would sleep with my brother, and then that was the custom. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And if we had visitors, by the way, which happened from time to time, people who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , where they had originally come from, then the two boys, my brother and I would sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Spread out a blanket on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and the guests would stay in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But that was the custom, and the — we really expected that this would happen, and di-di-didn’t affect us in any way, or didn’t bother us sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , because we slept just as well on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> as in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , as — as — as kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  What part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Well, we lived in the 20" district, known as the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Brigittenau</span> , about two blocks from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> , no running water in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">You went out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , where there was a cold water faucet that you got the water from, and then would bring it in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and — and then there was a— a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , it was sort of a — just a — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , which was shared b- between two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">A-And that — and that was the style, an-and that’s all I saw, and any people I came in contact with, they all seemed to have a similar setup except sometimes the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was even smaller than ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So, there was no — living in the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> , there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> , you walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And my grandmother October 17, 2010 would many times say, oh those steps, they’re killing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">You see, but at the time I says, you know, I don’t know why she’s complaining, there’s nothing to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">You know, I could take two steps at a time as a kid, running up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But the last time when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , two years ago, I walked those <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And — and — and I understood what my grandmother was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  So you said that you had siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Can you tell me their names, when they were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, my brother was two years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">His — his name was Benny, and he was born February of — of ’22. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I have a sister born March 8", ’26.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  And your sister’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Lilly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Did you have an observant family? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">What denomination did you belong to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Yeah, ultra-Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Ultra-Orthodox, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Come — come Friday, you know, the light would go off. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And we all, we’d have a light by the Shabbas candle, and we would have no heat, because it’s Shabbas, you know, you have to suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">A-And, you know, I remember — of course, you can’t get it on tape, but to show you, my grandmother would sit there, in va — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> it really gets cold, and sh-she would [indecipherable] she’d back and forth, you know, with her — with her feet and arm, trying stay warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But, no heat, until Shabbas was over, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">October 17, 2010
QUESTION:  So — so what did they — what did your family do for a Shabbat meal, given that there’s no heat? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Did they leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> on, or —
ANSWER:  Oh, we had the — a cold — I mean we had — we have a warm meal before going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Friday, and on Saturday we had something cold, that didn’t require any — any heating un-until Shabbas was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Which <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  It was called — well, my father would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Kasha(ph) temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I didn’t like to go there, so at first I— he would drag me with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I didn’t like it because I didn’t understand what was going on, and it was stand up and sit down and stand up and sit down and you know, and — and it went on forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So I would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Klikee(ph) temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The <span class="BUILDING">Klikee(ph) temple</span> was located on the Klikee(ph) gasse. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Many times in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> they — they would name the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> after the s — the <span class="DLF">street</span> that it was located on. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I liked the — the Klikee(ph) because after services, they would give candy to the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So it was — so naturally that was a big attraction for me, the candy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Now, when you say ultra-Orthodox, do you — do you mean Hasidic, or — or Orthodox?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">N-No, just ver-very much adherent, but not [indecipherable], no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  And you say that your family had originally come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">October 17, 2010
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">First my father came. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> to — because he was going to be drafted into the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He didn’t want to serve in the Polish army, so he ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And he heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , so he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And my mother later f-followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And as a matter of fact, she told me once that if — and you want me to say in German? [</span><span class="sentence" id="66">speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">When | arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , | thought I was in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">That’s how different it — living conditions were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , compared to the modern city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  And your — your father was trying to escape being drafted, was that during the run up to the first world war, or when was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  No, this was after.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  After?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Yeah, this was af —
QUESTION:  So what year did they come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  ’'m—I’m not quite — I think my father came there around maybe ’20, and my mother came a year later, ’21 or ’22, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Many questions tha-that I’m being asked now, I-I wish I had asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That’s why when I talk to — to my children, and when I talk to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , I always urge people — young — young children, to ask their parents while you still have an opportunity, or grandparents, what life was like for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Because I know you wi — are going to regret. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We all do, October 17, 2010 no matter how old, or — or — at the time, but eventually you — you’re going to regret that you did not ask certain questions while you had the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  So they came — both of them came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Did they speak Polish amongst each other, or Yiddish —
ANSWER:  Yeah, as a matter of fact, they spoke Yiddish normally, but Polish when they didn’t want us to know what they were talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So they’d switch to Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  So you didn’t grow up to — to know Polish, to learn Polish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We spoke yi — they would speak Yiddish, we would speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So — so I understood what they were saying, but we didn’t really speak Yiddish, w- we spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Di-Did your father have to speak German in his business life, or did — could he get by on Yiddish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Well, he spoke both. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So whatever the circumstances were, he could respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But the — most of the time, the people that he dealt with likewise were immigrants from adjoining <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was a more modern <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it offered greater opportunities than smaller <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , I mean — not smaller <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , you know, but — but th — not as advanced countries. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So he would speak — when he dealt October 17, 2010 with Gentiles, he spoke German, and with Jewish people, yeah, it was always — Yiddish was the international language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I always attended <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , and then —
QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> Jewish school</span> , or a <span class="BUILDING">state school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  No, a state. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Yeah, <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Which was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I attended <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , f-four years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary</span> , and then we switched over to something called <span class="BUILDING">hauptschule</span> , which was a sort of a— I guess in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> you’d call it <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And in my case, I — I couldn’t even finish the <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , because once Hitler came in, none of us were able to attend any <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we were kicked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and — and I sw-switched over to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> for a while, called Talmud Torah in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">second district</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">second district</span> was heavily populated by Jewish people, and they used to call it Matzoh Insel. </span><span class="sentence" id="102"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzoh Island</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  So bef — before the annexation, when you’re still able to go to — to a <span class="BUILDING">state school</span> , did you take any supplementary, or so-some sort of Jewish classes at the end of the day, or — or on Sundays, or —
ANSWER:  No, n-not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Only training for Bar Mitzvah, where a year ahead of time, I would sit down with someone, not a rabbi, but one of the Hassids, who would teach me the Torah portion that I was supposed to read at my Bar Mitzvah, which October 17, 2010 occurred in °37, actually four months before Hitler came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And it happened to be a very momentous occasion in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">You might find it funny, my grandmother was at first a little upset that I would have my Bar Mitzvah staged at the <span class="BUILDING">Klikee(ph) temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Why’? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Because the <span class="BUILDING">Klikee(ph) temple</span> had an organ. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And having an organ in a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , that — that was not kosher enough, so she wanted me to have it somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But I liked the Klikee(ph) temple, and I was going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So I had to tell her that although they have this organ, they never use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And the only time they use it was on Sundays when on occasion they have a wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But the mere fact that the organ was there, that was enough reason for her not to particularly enjoy being there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Since you went to a non-Jewish school until the annexation, did you have any non-Jewish friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">What was the distribution of Jews to non-Jews in your class?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  In— from grade one, I experienced anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Six years old, I go into grade one, another kid — they find out very soon whether you’re Christian or not, even at six. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And he called me a Christ killer, and you know, I didn’t know what that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I said — you know, what he was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And — and it was not — when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I asked my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And she said, oh, pay no attention, or this is something that they’re — where they’re taught at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> not to like certain people, but you’re gonna hear this, just — h-he doesn’t know what he’s saying, so just forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">October 17, 2010 But you mean — you very soon learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Later on actually, we would frequently have fights, wh-which — which occurred mainly when the priests came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and started showing movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And it dealt — you saw people with beards, and — and th-the payos and so forth, so you knew that — and they showed the crucifixion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Do you remember what grade this was? </span><span class="sentence" id="126">How old were you when these movies started to be shown?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I think I—I probably was around eight or nine, a-an-and — and when class lets out, then we started fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And many a day I’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a bloody nose because at that time, when somebody hit you, you — you struck back. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I was never hesitant, so it’s oh — you know, even as I went on to <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , you know, I — somebody said something to me, called me a dirty Jew, you know, I'd let him have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And you learn that if it’s one person, you take him on, but if there’s a group, I figured I’d better run. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But I was never scared, al-although my mother in particular always told me not to get involved, or — or — you know, walk away, run away, but I never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  How did your father feel about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Did he have an opinion about confrontation, or —
ANSWER:  I was always scared to tell my father, because — because he was the enforcer, you see, so I dealt mostly with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I — I had a mean — when I was — and — and October 17, 2010 also, many times, I — I admit, I didn’t listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I — I was — my mother would say, a reckless person. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">In the summer of ’34, I asked my mother if I could go swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I loved swimming, even as a child, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And she said no, you stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So I said to — okay, well, can I go downstairs, you know, be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">All right, be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but I want you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So I sai-said fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, I ran downstairs with my bathing suit to go swimming, that she had told me not to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I — in my eagerness to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> , didn’t look, and I was hit by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I had several fractures and lacerations and concussion and spent three months in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">That was an important lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But being somewhat reckless, rising to whatever challenge that came along, has always been a part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I-I was, to some extent, not to make myself some sort of a hero, I was always aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And sometimes it got me into trouble, but it never changed my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">This was in 734. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I have another event in ’37, when — wh-which had a great impact on my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">There were three boys, and we were walking along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> [indecipherable] only a three or four minute walk from where we lived, so — and this was in the winter of °37, late October, when, as we’re walking along, we notice something bobbing up and down in the wa — in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and we didn’t know at first what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And then we recognized that this was a person, you know, what is she doing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So — so it dawned on us that this person 1s about to drown. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So two of us ran October 17, 2010 down the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and jumped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was 13 — not quite 13, and my friend was not quite 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And the third person ran to get the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, if you know anything about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , and I know, since you are from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , you know the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , it’s a very swift <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">You’re not going to swim against the current, you just can’t, it just knocks you down. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So — so if you go in here, you’re gonna come out way, way down on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So after a while we — we struggled, but we were able to get her to th-the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and — and ou-out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And by that time, the third person had run to get the police, and when we got to — when we got her out to the side o-of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the police was there, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And they picked her up and th — it was a woman, and they took her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And then the police took the two of us to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And there they gave us some hot chocolate and d-dry out. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And a man came and started questioning us and then he took a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And we paid no attention as to who he was, or what was up, what — we were there several hours, and then they said to us, oh, now you can go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I ha — I hate to describe to you what took place when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">First of all, 1t was Friday evening, and I’m supposed to go with my father to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And, where were you? [</span><span class="sentence" id="171">indecipherable] So, I was so scared to tell what happened to — to my mother, so I said, do you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We were playing by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and I fell in. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Then came, how many times October 17, 2010 have I told you to stay away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">When are you finally going to listen, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And — and wa-was plenty of scolding and reprimand, you know, n-no food, you know, we’re not going to give you anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And of course I — I was so disheveled, you know, and tha — look — looked terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">A-And it wasn’t until the next day, when people stopped my mother on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and started congratulating her, and she didn’t know what for. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And then she found out that there had been a picture in the newspaper, which described what had taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And then she came back and started questioning, what — what really happened, you see, so sh-she was of two — two — two different feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">In the one, she says, do you realize how dangerous it was for you, what you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">A-And, this was very reckless. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And the other way she — she was proud that I had participated in — 1n saving a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But th-the recklessness was a major factor, that you would go to such an extreme, which was very, very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And by the way, I have a picture here, as it appeared in a newspaper, blew up and I’ll — Pll show it to you later; and also comments that were about me specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It just so happened that this particular event became a bone of contention between the Austrian more or less public press, which for the most part was anti-Semitic, and the Jewish press, an-and the Jewish publications, who took the German newspapers to task. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It — 1t just so happened that the two boys who jumped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The boy who ran to get the police was Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">October 17, 2010 It never occurred to us that this would ever be a problem, but it was a big bone of contention, a big discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The — I mean, in particular th-the Jewish press, because the Jewi — the Jews were always characterized as being cowards. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Jews — Jews didn’t want to be in the military, and Jews were afraid and — and unreliable, and — and they’re not really Austrian and so forth, and — but here was an example where two Jewish boys jumped in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We didn’t hesitate, we didn’t ask who it was, we didn’t ask what religion she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We just acted because we — we felt we — we should do something, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I have various correspondence which refers to that particular event, in — in several organizations who got involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">This was in October or — late October of 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">One month later I had my Bar Mitzvah, and at the Bar Mitzvah there was a lot of congratulation, because this was only a month later, and the Kultusgemeinde — the Kultusgemeinde, it’s called a cultural association, but really it’s not a cultural association, 1-1t was a sort of a semi- government authority for the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And every Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> had to deal with the Kultusgemeinde at least three times in their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The Kultusgemeinde issued the birth certificate, the marriage certificate and the death certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So — so every Jew had to register with the Kultusgemeinde, which later on also turned out to be a detriment for the Jewish people, because when the Nazis came in and wanted a list, all they had to do is go to the Kultusgemeinde and have a list of any October 17, 2010 — of a Jew living anywhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So at that time the Kultusgemeinde representative came to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , and th-they gave me a di-diploma of recognition for what I had done, and — and also a watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And this was the first watch that I had ever owned, so — so to me that — that was a big deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  You mentioned that there was a point of contention between the Jewish press and the mainstream press, and then you gave some great background about how Jews had been perceived, and — and obviously you being part of this heroic act was kind of going counter to the prevailing notion of — of how a Jew would act. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But I’m curious exactly how the Jewish press was making use of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">What were they saying, and what was — what was the conversation between the two <span class="BUILDING">presses</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Mostly it — it dealt — they were attacking the press for their attitude toward Jews, the reason for their hostility to Jews, and their idiocy as pertaining anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And their failure to recognize what we had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The majority of press had nothing, no comment whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">There was only one particular newspaper, it’s called “Das Kleine Blatt,” which carried a small picture of the two of us, and — and our age, and our name, and one paragra — one sentence, actually; and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">An-And no other publication — public — publication, who certainly at that time in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , if it had been anybody else, it would have been played up big, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, it’s interesting, no attention was — was paid to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Forty — 40 years later, my son, who October 17, 2010 was working in Congress, and I had just given an interview in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , where I was living at the time, and they wrote up the experience that I had, and my —my background and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And when he read it, h-he showed it to the congressman. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And congressman was Whitehurst from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He says well — well, we’ve got to do something, this is not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So he wrote a letter to the ambassador, giving him a — a copy of the article in the newspaper, and that I had never received any recognition. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So the ambassador at that time was Thomas Klestil. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Thomas Klestil went on from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , the ambassador being there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , to become the foreign minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And then, from the foreign ministry, became the president of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So the ambassador said that he had never heard of this, but he was going to investigate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  How old was the ambassador?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  I don’t know how old he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I — I suppose he was in his 40s, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But he would investigate, and it was maybe a couple of months later he came back and said yes, we have a record of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And they arranged a reception for me, and I met the ambassador, and he asked me if I would be willing to come back at the government’s invitation to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , they want to honor me. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And eventually I was given a gold medal for heroism, 40 years after the event.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  So this would have happened in the 70s and the 80s? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">When did this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">October 17, 2010
ANSWER:  I-It probably — I — I don’t have the — th-the date now. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It — probably in the 70s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  That’s a fascinating story. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He —
ANSWER:  It was a — let’s see now, I’m trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Yeah, ’78 maybe, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But this is not the end of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">When Hitler came in, as soon as Hitler and the Nazis took over in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , my mother was the driving force. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">She felt that we could not possibly stay on in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , we had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But there were many people at first, when Hitler came in that says, well, you know what’s going on, the — you know, with the plundering of <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and the beating up of Jewish people, and people s-stationing themselves, Nazi personnel in uniform stationing them — 1n front of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> , from — not to let anybody in. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I mean, not to let any Gentiles in to — to patronize the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They recognized right away that we cannot live — go on living in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , we had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So she wrote the letter to, you know, who — who do you write? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">A cousin of a cousin of a cousin that yo — she once heard of, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But she wrote a letter and she described our plight, that my —
QUESTION:  Where was this cousin? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">In the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Yeah, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , a-and whether or not he would be willing to send an affidavit, and then she asked for an affidavit for my father and my brother, and she — and at that time she felt, you know, let me get the men out. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">You know, th — October 17, 2010 nobody’s going to touch the women, and you know, and children and such, you know, what —
QUESTION:  Is this still 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  This was ’38, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Probably as early as April ’38. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Hitler came in in March, 13", I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  I’m sorry to cut you off all the time, but I’m very interested 1n this progression. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So your mother realizes pretty much immediately that there’s danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So I’m curious about the years °33 through 38. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">How are your parents, or adults around you, reacting to what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Did they talk about it at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Were you aware of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Yes, they talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And — and we knew about it, but we felt that the Austrians are very patriotic, and oh, we are social democrats, and oh — no, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ’s not going to become involved, you know — you know, this is <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And communications at that time were not what they are today. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So whatever was written in the paper and so forth, 1-1t was like a different world, going from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You — you — actually, you couldn’t go, un-unless you — you had to have visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You ri — you — you can go to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in an hour and a half, I’m in — 1n — today I’m in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Not in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">You had to have a — a visa or — to leave, and a visa to enter, a-and it was — you had to have a passport, and it October 17, 2010 was a complicated affair, you know, and — and transportation was not what it 1s today. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I mean, for me, as a— as — as a child, it w — it was a big deal to — to get ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and to — and to — and to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Oh, oh, that was an exciting event. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">As a matter of fact, somebody asked me once, how old were you when you first rode in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger automobile</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And the first time I rode in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger automobile</span> , I-I was a-around 16 years old, in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , trying to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> to — to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">That was in 1940, you know, and — and I’d never ridden in a — in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> before, but this was the first time.</span></p>

ANSWER:  N-N-N-No, you — you took a — first of all, the first means of transportation was to walk, you see, that was custom, the — no matter how far it was, you walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">A- And aside from walking, you took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And if you — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> were not available, except if you wanted to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , that’s where they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And —
QUESTION:  Did you ever <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  I didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Because if I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , I’d have to drag it up four f— four floors of <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I-I think that my parents would have been more concerned with safety, e-even then, because the — th-they knew that I probably would use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to go to <span class="REGION">areas</span> where they wouldn’t want me to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Where there’s October 17, 2010 maybe some traffic and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So most of the time I-I just walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I walked to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="306">I says, do you realize what problems that is? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I says, I gotta run here and there to get new identification and new driver’s license. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I got to stop all the credit cards, I says, it’s a whole lot of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And so he says, all right, keep the wallet. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And people couldn’t believe, you — you actually did that? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I says, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So, I—I- October 17, 2010 throughout life, I don’t panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I-I size up the situation a-as to what I need to do and — and act accordingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And — and I feel that when you panic, then many times the person who is the aggressor, will also panic, and then you don’t know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">People would ask me, they would — found it strange that the first time that you were held up, you had two blacks, right?

</span><span class="sentence" id="1316">You see, oh, I don’t know, maybe off a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet seat</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">It’s really nonsense, you see it was — so but this was — got a big laugh, and — and — and I would have the attention of the audience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">A-And when the war had ended, but I was still in <span class="REGION">Hawaii</span> , and troops were being repatriated back to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I asked the commanding officer if he will authorize me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there, so he said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">So I went to the — for a little while to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Hawaii</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">An-And then when I came back, I-I — you know, I thought I’d become a doctor, until one day I met a guy who had graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with me, and you know, hi Herb, you know, Phil, how are you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">We start talking to each other, where — what are you doing now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I says, well, I’m going to October 17, 2010 <span class="DLF">college park</span> , I’ve been accepted to be pre-med. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So he says, why do you want to go to pre-med? </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">He says, you know, when you finish it, what do you got? </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Then you still gotta go to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I says yeah, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">He says, well, why don’t you go to <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">I says, why should I go to <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">I want to become — he says, no, he says, you use that as your pre-med. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And this way you at least have a degree as a pharmacist and you — and you can work during the summer and then pay for <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> — because I had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">So I thought it was a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">The — the problem was that 1t was mid-August and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> starts in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">So — so, how do I get in? </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Because at that time so many thousands of soldiers came out, an-and they all wanted to go into — applied to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hopkins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1336"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hopkins</span> turned me down and said, reapply next year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Well, you’re not going to sit around for a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Now I’m in my 20s, 21 or 22 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">So I — you know, I’ve — I thought about it, I says, you know, it’s not a bad idea, but would I get in? </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">So — so I-I went there, and I asked to meet th-the dean of admission, was a elderly woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And she gave me the same answer, she says, we — we can admit you next year, but our classes are closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">I don’t think it’s gonna be possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">She says, well, 1f somebody last minute doesn’t want to come in, you know, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">I’ll give you an application, she says, but I wouldn’t bet on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I-I-I don’t think that it’s gonna be possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">So I said to her — her name was Kohl(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">I-I-I said, Dean Kohl(ph), if you admit me, October 17, 2010 Pll come back and kiss you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">The whole of — the whole <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there overheard this conversation, they all burst out laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">But I got in.</span></p>
