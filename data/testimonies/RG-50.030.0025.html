<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay, Sonia, the first thing I want you to do is tell me your full name, and when and where you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And then just tell me a little bit about your growing-up years, your community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , this was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novogrudok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">They had 10 or 15,000 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born in April 15, 1922, to a very rich father and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I had four brothers, two older and two younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And I had my education there. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was studying in a liceum, with languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I finished gimnazjum, and then I went for two years in liceum where I studied Latin, French, Polish, and History. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">When -- before the war broke out, I was two, three months before finishing my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I was dreaming to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , because we had a family there, to study dentistry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sorbonne</span> with the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My mother’s was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But the war came in, and my dreams finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The German came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in December 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We didn't know nothing about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">You know, it was small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We know only that very bad will be for the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">But we couldn't imagine it should be so, so bad, because when the first German came, they were dancing with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And one -- I was a pretty girl, and one told my parents, “Make her papers that she is Polish and let her go from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because it will be very bad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And that's what -- when they went, they came, the S.D. and the S.S., and the war began. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">In the beginning it was not so bad, because they begin -- After two months, they began to organize the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So all the people went out from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and they put us on -- ina small -- in a couple of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Pereseka. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">They're called, Pereseka. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">This was like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> , like one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And we were staying there till they said we have to go out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and this began the Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">When the Aktion began, my father saw that is very bad, so he took me, and -- I had a brother -- Jay, and he said, “Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I will show you something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And he ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He knew the policeman, the Polish, and they let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So I ran away to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where my mother was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> because my father know there the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We stayed there about seven days under the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">They had a place in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where the potato -- they were holding the potatoes should not freeze. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we staying there for a whole week. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He let us stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And after a week, he said, “The action is gone and you can go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We didn't know where my mother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But my mother was a very intelligent girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She was a rabbi's daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And she saw from far that my father went away with me, with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She understood that he will take care, too, on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So she took care on herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">She run to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where she was born, this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barabevit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And there friends of hers, what she was studying with them in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he keep her for 10 -- or two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Was he Jewish or not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  The friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Not Jewish, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The people -- they were very good people, too, not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Not every Jew is good, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There is certain people what are better than Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They were keeping us, and if they would find them, he would be killed together with his whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But he was keeping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">After two weeks, when I was already with my father and brother in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he came in and he said, “You know what, I would like to know if Mr. Boldo 1s alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He didn't say that he has my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So they said “yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They let him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And he said, “You know, I have your wife.” </span><span class="sentence" id="59">This was a shock for us because we were sure that she is not alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And after a couple of days, she came and she was with us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Will you tell me -- go back a little bit to the action and tell me what happened, and how your father got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I mean, were you right there or did--
ANSWER:  We stayed near my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My father was a tall, strong guy, and everybody knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So he sneaked in and he took me and my brother away from the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And you know this small <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so he keeps us in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for two hours or three hours till they took away everybody for killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The policemen saw him, but he didn't hold us. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They let him go because he knew him from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He was a Polish policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And that's how we survive for the couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">After the action, we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We didn’t -- we were not hungry because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , the people, knew that we are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They were bringing us food, bread, meat, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were beautiful, wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And till today, we are sending them packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They are not alive, but we send them packages to give to the kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Those -- the first actions, were they for specific people or -- I mean, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the first action was before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They took all the doctors, the intelligent people, and they killed them in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> — 50 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They took away the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And then in the month -- in December, this was a regular action for whoever was in the <span class="DLF">street</span> they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">This is the -- first of all, they took the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They said that they are going to work on a -- work in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Nobody knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But the paysans, that means people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , they knew because they saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And they were coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they were saying, “There is no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They are all killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This was the first action.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  That's how your father knew what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He knew everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So you came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And then tell me a little bit about living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and how long you were there, what it was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  We stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I think, a couple of months they came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- after the couple of months, this was a regular living. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I was working in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and the others was working in the <span class="DLF">street</span> because the <span class="DLF">street</span> were bombardment, bombard. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Everything was broken, so they were cleaning up. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And this was not so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Nobody — they were thinking, you know -- people were thinking what’s good is for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They were thinking, “I will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They are not touching us no more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And they were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Then one day, a son of friends of ours came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And said, “You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I saw 11 people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that went out at night and I know where they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , but nobody survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Because they told them where to go, and the Germans were staying there already and waiting for them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And this was the first group for the trying to went out, and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So, you know, that’s very difficult to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We can go out, but we will not be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So this was first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">This was -- I think this was already after the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The winter was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the winter is terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So this was probably in March or April another group went out, and we never heard about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The German came and the they were gave -- they went to segregate the young and the healthy, and they took them to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novogrudok</span> , there was a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And there in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> they were working, and the rest stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on the Pereseka. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There were the kids, the older, and the sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They didn't kill all of them right away, but after a couple of months, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They begin to talking about in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that something 1s wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They’re preparing something, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Nobody knew what and where. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My parents stayed in there, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pereseka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And my father said, “I don't want her to be there,” to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So they paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We had gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We had many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And they paid to a Polish man what he was bringing the bread to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So he paid him. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And he bring in -- one night, he bring the bread to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and he put me in the basket from the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And he brought me to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was there not a long time, because my parents began to receive letters from the partisan, from my husband, from Alex. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And he wrote him -- he didn't know me, I didn't know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">There is a big difference between from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He was from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , very small, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stankiewicze</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">There were five <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">One of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , one Jewish family, the Bielskis. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And they had, I think, about 10 brothers and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And his sister was married to uncle of mine, but I never knew him, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was great uncle, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And she said -- she was too, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And she said to him, “You know what, I saw by the Boldos’ a beautiful girl, and I would like you to send somebody after her.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And he was a very good- he had two -- he had a wife and a three-month-old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But he didn’t go -- after she gave birth to the child, she didn't want to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So this day when he send after her was the liquidation of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and she got killed with the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So he was by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he wrote a letter to my parents that he will guarantee my safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I was afraid for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was afraid for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I was afraid for everything because I never were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But when my parents saw what is here, they said, “Listen, I want you to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I would like you -- better to die there than I would see you dead here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And he send a couple of men with rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And at night, my father paid again to the police, Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I went out with the friend of mine, Leah, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I came there -- we went out there about 12 o'clock, we came there about four o'clock, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where we saw already about 18 people with rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was afraid of them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I was not used to that, but I got used to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then I met my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So it was very nice in the morning, about 6 o'clock in the morning, my friends Chaya’ that was already the girlfriends from mine other brother-in-law, Asael’. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She said, “You know, I have a commander and I am with him and I am very happy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I said to her — I was looking on her -- and I said, “Can you tell me maybe there's another commander?” </span><span class="sentence" id="169">She said, “Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">One is Alex, his brother, the younger.” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I said, ““Who is he? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Where is he?” </span><span class="sentence" id="173">She said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">About seven o'clock you will see him." </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And really about seven o'clock I saw a man with rifles, all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I saw a man, a giant. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He was six-two, and a young handsome -- I had afraid of him, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But life is life. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">After -- He was very good to me from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He was very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And he said to me, "You know, you came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I would like you to stay with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I said, "You know what, I will stay with you, but I want you to take out my parents." </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I made with him like, “You know, you have to take them out, then I will stay with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And it took him all about seven or six days and my parents came. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">After my parents came, after a day, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> went in flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But I came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> end of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">August 15 was the second Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And my brother died there, got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He didn't get killed in the action, but he saw that they were taking away my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">My father was staying with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So he went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">My mother, so he wanted to take care on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So he took her out from the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , dead, to the <span class="DLF">lines</span> of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">You understand what I am talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And the German -- the people were counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he knew that somebody is missing, but he couldn't give out my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So they took him in on the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Kozlowksi was a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">He born not far from my husband's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He were coming -- He went to the German, to the Polish, and he will bring all of the news to the brother Bielskis. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">If you need something, medicine or something, he went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and he bought it, or stole it, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But the medicine we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We got the salt and the sugar, whatever we needed from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">He was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Now the children become -- his children are alive and we are sending them money and packages and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He was one from the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But he was bringing us everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I know about him, because if somebody came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- people were coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> -- they didn't know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was Kozlowksi's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So he was keeping them. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And he said, "Don't worry, somebody will come and they will take you to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They were beautiful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">You don't have to forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">You cannot say that everybody was bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  Tell me what it was like in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Tell me about the setting up of the community, and tell me how it changed from that first --
ANSWER:  When I came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , they had only 75 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That was the group of the Bielskis brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That was the four brothers -- the three brothers and they had their brother, Aaron, 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And they have a sister, what she was married to Chaya's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So that was the Bielskis and the Dzienciolskis. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">This was the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But later came another seven men and they made 70 people, 70 or 80 people, when I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">This was the beginning of the partisans because people were -- went away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> -- went away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And they -- the <span class="DLF">doors</span> from the Bielskis brother were open for everybody, for old, children, sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And they had always food. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They didn't * Konstanty Kozlowski have steaks, but they have bread and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They were no different, but later, then many people came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So there were men that said, “Listen, why do I have to go and grab food and risk my life? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">My wife is not here, my children are not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Why should I risk the life for them?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But the Bielskis brother said, “Everybody who is coming has to have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And eerybody will have a piece of bread.” </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They will not have maybe something else, but bread they will give everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">This was one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , one big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they were cooking potatoes with a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And this was the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Later, when the people came in more and more, they went out and knew that the Germans were 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And the German came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and knew they will collect bread and butter and milk and meat, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So we were putting ambushes -- ambush is that the right word?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  ...and they were taking away the food from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And that's what we had the food for the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We made ambush on them and got their rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We got everything from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Nobody was sending us. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They were killing the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They took away the food, took away the rifles, and we were in business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Do you know about -- I think it was probably soon after you came -- the big harvest, when the Germans were going to get a percentage of the harvest, and so they burned the -- tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> told us everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Not us, to the Bielskis brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They were afraid of them, terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">One cannot fight, but if you three brothers, six-two with rifles and you knew you cannot live, you knew that he will touch something, whatever, you will not do the nght thing, they will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So they did everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They were telling us that in a couple of days they have to pay to the German so much and so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Not in money, but in food. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So the Bielskis knew that the food is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> are giving them. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We need it, too, the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So that's what we took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">That was the harvest. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">That's what you mean, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And we took away and we told to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , remember one thing, you giving them because you don’t want, because Germans, too, they were killing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They were killing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They put everything on a fire and they went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So you have to give them, half them and half to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And that's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They were not always friendly, because you see, there were Aktions. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The Bielskis were fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Not everybody, but they had a group of fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They had, the beginning, they had about 50 fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Later, the number went up and up and up. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And they were not only fighting with the Polish police, they were fighting between the partisans, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They were Polish -- not Polish, but German partisan — German -- Russian partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They were against us, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">First of all, because we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Second, because we knew better the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and we knew the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So this was a plus, a big plus for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And they were saying that we are taking away all of the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Remember 1,000 people in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You have to feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And they were not sitting all of them in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">We had afraid for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So in groups, this was about 20 people in groups, they were sitting in the summertime up. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">In the wintertime, we had under the -- underground they were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And when you are in the snow, every little thing you can see. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So we were very careful, but you know you cannot take away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They knew very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">The Bielskis knew the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but they knew, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So we have to be in peace with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">You cannot take away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">You have to leave them, too, for the family, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But we managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">In the wintertime, I never were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I was always -- it's called a hutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">This mean a <span class="DLF">farm</span> from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So I went with my husband and another 15 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They were riders. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And went there, sleep over about four or three hours and we went back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But they were very good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I cannot say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Nobody would survive if not the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They had afraid, but they give us whatever we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Later, already in -- this was in ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">In ‘44, we got already the rifles and everything from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They were sending us by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And they were bigger commanders than the Bielskis. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They were commanders what they put on the front from the Russians, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And they were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They said to us like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We were complaining always. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">You know, they have took a group of ours, 14 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They took away their rifles, took away their food, and let them go without shoes even. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They said, “Remember Mr. Bielski -- brother Bielski, remember one thing, this 1s life. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">You have to fight for them -- for that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Not once my husband -- My husband was always between the German and the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The Polish, they were working together with the German, the Kozaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">He was always on the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He was giving everything to the all partisan and from the Naliboki puszcza. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">You know what is a puszcza, puszcza is the biggest <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , you cannot live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">This is only for the animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">This is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novogrudok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">This was between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novogrudok</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But we were there in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And they couldn't find us because you have to go by foot or by horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They cannot go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They were surrounding us and we heard them talking and shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And we were sitting on mud without food for 10, for 12 days, till my husband -- I am telling you everything in one story -- till my husband said, “They cannot take no more hunger.” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">This was the only brother he said, “I cannot -- I have to go fight myself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So he took 150 people -- not 150, 90 people, and I was, too, in the group by my husband, and he opened the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We come in after the German who saw the fire still burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">They were warming the food, but nobody touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">When we went out to open the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , after a day, another 100 people went out and another hundred people because the Germans left us alone and we went away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And then we went to get organized again. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">This was the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We were fighting them not in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You cannot fight a German soldier in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We were surrounding them. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We know where they are and we were fighting them and took off everything from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And that’s what this was life of the partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Not only us, there were the Russian partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">The same thing, they were fighting, not in the open <span class="DLF">field</span> , because in the open <span class="DLF">field</span> you got killed from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They had better everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  So you hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and waited till they came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  And when you rode with your husband, that time when you first left the thick <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , were you carrying a gun, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Yeah, I had a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I had always a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But I never shoot the gun, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">When I was with my husband, I was not afraid of nothing, nothing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But when I didn't see him, I was afraid of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I had a gun for myself, for my protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">This 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I had a very good life in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He gave to me everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I never cooked. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I never did nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I was the commander's wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You met my sister-in-law, Lilly. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">There were three brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">The oldest was Tuvia. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">You know, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , the older brother is the head of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And when they got together, they put him, Asael, his older brother, and Zusia’, they made him a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They made him the head of the partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">He was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They, all of them, they were very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  If they hadn't been there do you think that things would have worked out the way they did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Nobody knew the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They were born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">They were born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and they knew the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and they knew the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">How could I survive, or somebody else? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">All 1,200 people, nobody would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Because there were people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , too, not only from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novogrudok</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baranovichi</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> -- the people never were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">You know, Jewish people, they are not going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Only they survived because of the Bielskis brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I cannot say because of Tuvia, because of Asael, because of Zusia. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">No, the three of them, they were one. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Because nobody did something where the other one didn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">All of them, they work together. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Whatever they had between them, nobody knew, but they were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And that is what we survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  How do you think they knew that the only way to survive was to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  Their instinct, instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You know, when you are born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , yes, you think that is the whole world. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That is the whole world for them, for the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They knew that if they would go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they will get killed because once Tuvia got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to take something and they took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">The German took him, hit him so, so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And he -- I don't know how he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">At night we were sitting, and he said, "What I am sitting? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">What am I waiting for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And he ran away to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">The first in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was my husband and his brother, Asael. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">How come the first? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">My husband, when the German came, he was in the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You know, the Russian, when they came in ‘39, they were taking the young > Aleksander Bielski people to the army for work, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So he was in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But he saw on the <span class="DLF">road</span> going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he said that was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Whoever came and they were asking him, “Are you a Jew, or you are Polish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="473">whatever, they got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So he said “no.” </span><span class="sentence" id="475">He was speaking very nicely Russian and speaks beautiful Polish. </span><span class="sentence"
