<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tell us your name and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Ruth Borsos. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I — my maiden name was Moser, and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  And when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Oh, when — in 1923, the 15th of October.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Would you tell us a little of your family life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I had a rather normal childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I grew up in a middle-class family and my paternal grandparents lived very close to us and so did my maternal grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I went — started to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Jewish children went there, like any other children of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and in 1933 it was the time that Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Things started to change radically. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Nearly overnight, when we came back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we were segregated in a sense that suddenly all the children knew who are the Jews and who are not the Jews, because we were received with words of “dirty Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They started to throw rocks at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We had to — every child had to learn to sing the Nazi hymn and — but soon thereafter we were forbidden — the Jewish children were forbidden to sing the Nazi hymn, so we were segregated and we felt it all the way from every morning that we came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was towards the end of the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> years that my parents took me out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and entered me in a special <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> with many other children who left the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I passed a few years in the special <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , then went on to the higher <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> and stayed there until 1938, and in 1938 the pogroms against the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Could you describe those pogroms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">The pogroms were only an excuse of what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">A young Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was very aggravated because his parents had been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he took revenge by shooting a German diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And, as you might know, in November the 9th, 1938, the famous Kristallnacht' broke out and it was because as a revenge, as a retaliation against the Jews, because this man had murdered a German diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But what I know was that <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> were attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They were raided. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They were raided. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">People stole, demolished and in general most Jewish males were picked up and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The duration during that time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was relatively short from what happen — will happen later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">After approximately two weeks most people were sent back to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Now this was in '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Already between '33 and '38 a lot of Jews had lost their civil rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">As for instance my father, who was a lawyer, he was already debarred. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He could no longer go to the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> and he — doctors had lost their privileges in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Actors could no longer act on the, on the public stages, and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Also in 1935 with the Nuremberg laws, a lot of discrimination against Jews occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was no longer inter-marriage possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There was no longer relationship with non-Jews possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">You couldn't even visit a <span class="BUILDING">Christian home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You no longer could have a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">If you had one who was — had to be over 45 years of age, because I think the Germans were horrified at the thought that their German race could be possibly defamed by some act. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Anyway also just before that time, during all these years between '33 and '38, I recall for instance that a friend of mine who always played with me, who we always together — one day she came and said, "I can no longer come to your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I said, "How come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And she said, "Well, my father told me I'm no longer allowed to play with you because you're Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So this friend disappeared and I never saw her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Other friends, Jewish friends, Jewish children who lived in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , left from one day to the next because they immigrated maybe with their parents or they went across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Whatever, it was a terrible time of real turmoil and repression, and in 1938 after the Kristallnacht, my family in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> tried to get me to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> with a children's transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My father — my parents were divorced at that time already and my father was traveling in Europe and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and trying to see how they could establish a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">When he came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 19— I believe it was 1932, he proposed to the family that we should leave immediately but my mother did not want to and she refused to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So when he went later to the different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to see where he could get a permit to stay, it became already very, very difficult because each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> only let in so many so-called “foreigners.” </span><span class="sentence" id="52">In 1938 at that time he had a permit to stay for six months in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and when I did not come with the children's transport because my papers were lost, he and my uncle went to the Dutch authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My uncle was a very energetic man who really pulled his weight — went into a meeting and said he has to have papers to get me out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and he did get a permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And he called us at night and my mother took me to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> and we — my uncle's chauffeur was coming across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and picked me up and withered me through the German and the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> guards and helped me cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> and so I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Now in 1938 life was pretty normal in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But we were, of course, strangers and first stayed with my family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilburg</span> , and later on I came to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But, but because of the work of my father — he was very rarely there and we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> and I — there was really no good home life to speak of. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And we always played with the idea that we had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because there was really no good future for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">My father worked at that time with the Dutch authorities who dealt — Dutch Jewish authorities, who dealt with resettling refugees, Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He also played a role at that time in as a Dutch delegate to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> St. Louis, who was not allowed to land in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And he went to, at that time, to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to help rescue the people and settle in so many only. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> tried to take a number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> took some. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And so he was involved with this work, so he was really very rarely there. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And towards 1940 we were able to get a permit to get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and in May 9th, 1940 we took the few belongings we had brought out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we took those and took them to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , and we were supposed to sail with the Veendam the next morning, May the 10th, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">May, May 10th, 1940 came. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I woke up in the morning and I hear these funny little sounds and I look out and I see puffy little clouds in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> and all the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch houses</span> , <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> , have very flat roofs and I see people on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and I wonder what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Anyway I went up on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and I see and I was told that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> were flying overhead and they had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I woke up my dad and I said, “I don't think we'll be going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Well, that was it, we didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And 19— May 10th, this happened, and five days later the Germans capitulated — I mean the Dutch capitulated and the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And pretty soon the German occupation started of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and of course with the occupation, all the repressions against the Jews started, started out. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I cannot remember exactly how it started out but what happened was that you no longer could pursue your work in, in non-Jewish businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Slowly things were taken away from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Your civil rights were taken slowly away. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It was really a repeat of what happ— had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You had to wear a yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Pretty soon you could no longer shop in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There were certain hours only between three and five in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You could no longer go out as much as you wanted at night because you had to be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">There was a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You couldn't even sit — if you had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , you couldn't even sit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in your <span class="DLF">garden</span> after the curfew hours, so—.
QUESTION:  What was this like for you as a young person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well, it wasn't very easy to grow up as a young person like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It, it was a very bad existence and the trouble was that each day something new happened and something more repressive happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the thoughts were always in the mind, “How can we escape from this and how — what can we do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The only possibility would have been to go underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But that was very difficult and it was very dangerous because you had to have the right connection to people who would hide you <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You had to have the right accommodations for underground, because you couldn't live freely because we all had an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So, people who had an accent were immediately prone to be discovered, even with a false passport or false ID paper or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So for a long time we were thinking how we could do that, how we could possibly find a refuge this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">There were people hidden on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There were people hidden in <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There were people hidden in <span class="INT_SPACE">back rooms</span> for years and years by Dutch peasants, by Dutch peo-people of good will and good heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">There were also people who were betrayed, but we really never reached that stage because it was not possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Had you made friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  I had a few friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I did not have very many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I — most of my friends were refugees themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I did go to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for refugees, a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because of the language problems but we did get some instructions and I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And my father worked at that time, as I had mentioned before, for a Dutch — for a Jewish refugee organization which later on turned partially into the Jewish Council and I later myself had a small job in the sewing division, making clothes for people, for German people really as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We never knew exactly for whom we were working and so I had a — also want to mention that during that during all this period I mentioned before, I believe it was in 1942, that we all had to wear a yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">This yellow star had to be on the left side of your clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">If you wore three layers that day it had to be on three layers of your clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It had to be attached. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There was — you were not allowed to be able to put one finger through the behind between your clothing and the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It had to be sewn on properly, and if somebody saw you on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you had to have ID papers, the proper ID papers with a “J” in it and your yellow star and if something was wrong, you were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And you didn't come back or maybe you were arrested and were sent on somewhere right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Well, also during that time, as I had mentioned to you before, during the night many times the, the SS or the police — not the Dutch police but the German patrol, police or whatever their designation was — came to various <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , looked for Jews, wanted to see their ID papers, wanted to see whether they had special permits to stay away from being sent for relocation in the east, and these special stamps were sometimes that you had a — you did quote, unquote, "a very important work" or that you had the possibility of getting a visa to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> via <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> or that maybe you had instead of four Jewish grandparents you had only three Jewish grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">There were a variety of little stamps, which were possible in your ID card which would delay your transport, but it didn't prevent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So we were — I personally was arrested at least three times during the night, taken to a special <span class="NPIP">place</span> which usually was the place which at one time was a Jewish theater. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And you never really knew whether you would be released again, what would happen to you the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We were sitting around, we were wondering and worrying what would happen, but on July the 6th in 1943 was the biggest razzia, repression against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They, they — big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with SS were driving through the different <span class="DLF">streets</span> with the bullhorns on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and they were calling all the Jews to leave their <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Now for weeks and weeks and months and * Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German) months we knew that this day will come one day and we always had prepared ourselves in a sense by having a backpack ready with a few belongings to take with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We knew that we were not allowed to take many things, but they would allow us one change, one sweater, a toothbrush, a pair of extra shoes, an overall and maybe a coat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  How did you know that? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">How did you know that would happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  It was known through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was made known from the Germans to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> that this is what is allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">There is not allowed anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So you knew that your day will come and you didn't know when and you knew that this is if you ever have to go away, this is what you can take with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">That day when we were all called out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , we — they marched us from wherever you lived to the central point. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It could be around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It could be a half an hour away, whatever it was, we were gathered all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We are standing in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> for a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We did not know what was going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They didn't give us any food, no water, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Well, towards late afternoon one of the highest SS was coming to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and he was doing the selecting of who would be sent away and who would not be sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And one by one we were called up to appear before him to show him our papers and he would decide. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">When my father's turn came, he said to him, “Mr. Moser, you have to decide whether you and your daughter will go on transport or whether you will stay behind.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He would not dispense both of us from transport but he would — considered my father to stay behind, so my dad decided that he would stay behind, hoping that, you know, he could do something for me, he would be able to get me out of this again. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And we were — those who had to leave right away were reassembled and marching in fours down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I looked back and I saw my dad looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> as, as we were leaving that <span class="DLF">street</span> and that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We were marched towards the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> where a big mass of people were already coming from the various neighborhoods in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , reassembled in that <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And in that <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> were rows of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> with Germans sitting who were registering us by name, by ID, taking everything we had like watches, rings, whatever we had of any little value — took it away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But they left us with that rucksack. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They went through it, too, mind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They looked through what was in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So, then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> at that time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> were running but there was — that morning there was absolutely nobody on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They put us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> started to roll and we did not know — we knew that we are going on transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We knew that we were going to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> which called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , but we did not know by what means we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They took us with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> and these <span class="DLF">tramways</span> were accompanied on each side by huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limousines</span> in which all filled with SS just so that nobody could leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , nobody could escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They were running over the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> , over the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and if there were any people they had to flee up into their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and, and <span class="DLF">roadways</span> — I mean <span class="DLF">entrances</span> so that they wouldn't be just crushed on by, by these SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But we came to a small <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> were already waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Germans were standing around with big — what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Big dogs, shepherd dogs, and pacing, pacing up and down the quays, loading the people into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and I sort of twaddled around, I was trying to hide first between some lamp posts, a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and so forth, and I was seeing whether it's possible for me to escape from this, but I really wouldn't — didn't know because even if I were able to leave that <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , where was I going to go since I didn't know before where. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But it was just sort of an instinct, “Maybe they can't catch me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Well they did and of course I was one of them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trucks</span> and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They closed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and we still were in a fairly cooperative spirit, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We try to sort of console our — one another and late at night we arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We couldn't even really see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> —
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the trip, what it was like on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  That, that trip, contrary to the trip in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , that trip — I remember there were a lot of young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I didn't know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But I know there were a lot of young people in that particular <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The ride was maybe three hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Contrary to the other trip I took — for days in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> — there was a much better mood than there was later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">You had lived so long with the knowledge that you would be picked up one day, that you would be sent away one day, that you would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> one day, that now it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">You were on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I mean it was nearly like no longer — you didn't have to expect it any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was there, which 1s really a terrible thing, but, but it was nearly like a relief because they couldn't — they picked you up, but you knew this was it, it couldn't happen over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So when we arrived finally at night in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it was already dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We, we didn't know exactly how that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> would look. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We knew it smelled when we arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It, 1t wasn't a very pleasant smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And we were given — we had to go through another registration, mind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That was the second one that day, but that was more that like a receipt, “Yes, these people have arriven,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we were, were told to go to various <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">There was no light in front of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">There was only this terrible stench, and you entered the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and you barely saw anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You, you saw a lot of things that you knew something — there was a lot of stuff toward the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> but you didn't really quite realize what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Your eyes had to adjust for a long time, and you wanted to find — what do you call 1t? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Can you cut it a minute?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Yes, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So we — I found something on the third level and I climbed up there with my backpack and I came to lay next to a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I didn't know her. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">She didn't know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But I remember we talked long into the night of how we got there and what our experiences were and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And the next days in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were put to work, real silly work. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We had to carry sand from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">It didn't make sense, but we had to do it, and as time went by they organized us into a variety of tasks, what we had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Well, I was really delegated to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were sewing clothing, again sewing clothing, for — I'm not quite sure for whom it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">That was the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Sometimes we would — I worked at a Dutch, but this was a Nazi, a Dutch Nazi farmer's farm. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He had us clean out the pig sties. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He had us work around his <span class="DLF">farm</span> , clean up certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He had us work in the <span class="DLF">potato fields</span> , or whatever, so that he didn't have so much — we were slaves to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He profited from, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> being so nearby and from being a Nazi and collaborating with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And as a reward he would sit us with the chickens in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and give us a watery soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That was the meal for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And we had to wear the Dutch klompen,° you know, the Dutch wooden shoes and if you're not used to it and you have no socks and you have nothing proper to protect you, these things are very hard and you had blisters every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And every morning before you went to work there was somebody who took a needle and punched those blisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It was not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Anyway, this time passed too and a lot of illnesses broke out already in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> I remember that I got jaundice and I was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I mean I was so nauseated and so ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And I didn't say that before, but every Tuesday night — every Tuesday the lists of those people who were going to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> — we assumed it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we didn't know one hundred percent, but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Usually the conductor or somebody would let on where they came from, to pick up more people and to send them off to away and towards the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Well lists were assembled during the day on Monday and on Tuesday they were read off in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">A Kapo* came to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and was reading off the names of those who were sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And as you can imagine this was some horrible, horrible times. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">People finding out that this was really probably the end or they — we didn't know hundred percent what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We, we knew it was terrible but we didn't know exactly how terrible it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And everybody would help always those who had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They would help them to assemble their stuff, to console them, to give them whatever they had, a little food left to give them on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And it was maybe four months after that I was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from the razzias, from the raids on the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and other locations in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> came all the way into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp compound</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So each afternoon we always heard by — there was always an underground kind of a communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I don't know how one found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">There were people who had special permits, maybe, who went in and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="212">One got little messages. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">This day one got the message that a big raid on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> had picked up the rest of the Jews, or nearly the rest of the Jews who still were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and we went to meet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">You could — were able to do that, to go the quays and sure enough my father and his wife were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . * </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Clogs (Danish) * Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor commando of prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And of course it was the same story for him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He was integrated into doing some kind of labor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but end of the year 1944 — I think it was early September — we were all sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And we packed up our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We went out to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">There were the SS with the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was no escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">There was no hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">You — there was no means. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">If somebody didn't step into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">That was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We came to another ride but that was at least two days if not longer in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And compared with the first ride and experience in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , this was a much sadder story because we knew nothing good was expecting us, even worse than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had a — I'm sorry, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It, it was just a wooden plank. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It was filled with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">You couldn't lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You could stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You could maybe if you were lucky you got in between, you could sit on one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">There was a big vat and that was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> for everybody for two and a half days. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">There was no drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They didn't — the <span class="DLF">doors</span> didn't open. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">There was a little slit in, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> and you could look out sometimes, but you didn't know where you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I mean you only knew you were rolling, rolling, rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When we arrived in at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> closest to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which was in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> , in the Luneburger Heide, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> finally opened and we were told to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Weakened and not very good condition already because of this days we pass in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And I'll never forget.... First of all I personally was kicked by an SS to get out, and so I really fell out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But when I got up on my, my legs, I looked up and I saw this <span class="DLF">bridge</span> going — a <span class="DLF">street</span> really, a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , a <span class="DLF">street</span> — going across the rails and there were children on this <span class="DLF">bridge</span> looking down on us and yelling “dirty Jews” and throwing rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I always remembered this because after the war I was told so many times, “Well, we didn't know anything about anything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And I never forget these children standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">How come they knew? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">How come they always — they waited for these for these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> to arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I know many more knew, but these children knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Well, anyway we were then led to march towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was a long march, and I remember it was through a beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">birch forest</span> and I kept looking at the birches and I thought, ““This 1s so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">How can this be? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">How is it possible that here we are the way, like cattle, they are pushing us to march along?” </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Nobody was — could stay behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">If somebody broke down, you had had gotten a kick, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">When we arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were assigned to certain <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and there the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were much narrower, much higher, many more, more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> closer together and instead of one person to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , we were assigned two persons to one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">There was a little straw on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and I ended up with Hannelore, who was my father's second wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We shared a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and we also shared the water, which was dripping from through the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> into our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So we had this tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> to us where we had to put our belongings, whatever we had, plus ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Two tall people in this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> with the straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But we shared a raincoat and so we spread that raincoat at night over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And in the morning you looked up and there was a puddle in the middle of it between the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And we had to somehow get rid of the water if we didn't want to splash it just over overboard so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Well, the food was minimal, to say the least. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was a watery soup as rutabagas, the smallest portion of bread which had to last for a whole week. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Some people ate it up right away because they were so afraid that that 1t might not be there when you went to work and you came back at night that somebody might have stolen it, the smallest amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So some people ate it nght away. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Some people were hiding it in some ingenious way. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Some people couldn't make — couldn't, couldn't last for the whole week because it was really such a small portion. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And the rutabagas were, were awful, too, because most of them were hard and if — I have seen people who did not eat the — you know, when it becomes real bad, sometimes dried out and gray, they took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And I have seen other people pick up those which were taken out and chewed over by other people and take it just because of the hunger cause they had nothing really to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">How one survived this I — to this day, when I look back I never understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I, I don't understand how we could have survived, but we did, with such a small amount of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Anyway the work we had to do was another useless work. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We were assigned to cut out from uniforms from German soldiers which were — had either died on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> or were shot by — I don't know by whom, but anyway and they were bloody uniforms, and we had to cut off all the buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We had to cut off all little pieces which were not blood-drenched and these were saved for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The Germans needed the buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They needed the little pieces, because the war had also left them with very few material goods and, and they used it to repair other uniforms, to, you know, to whatever, make do. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We had to work in this from morning to night. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But the mornings in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> life started off that you had to go out on the <span class="DLF">Appellplatz</span> ,” which means the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where everybody had to assemble. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">A huge <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">All <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had to come there at a certain hour, early in the morning after the Kapos woke you up very early, and two, three SS standing there and counting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Every morning we were counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Why we were counted I cannot tell you, but it had to be precise and if the numbers didn't come out, you had to be counted again. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">If it took one hour, if it took five hours, they didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You had to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Whether it was cold, whether it was raining, whether it was sunshine — you had to be counted and during the same time that we were all standing out there, they would run horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> where they threw the bodies of those people who were either shot or hanged or had died from hunger, from whatever, and they wanted to make sure that we see each morning these horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> drive by. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And I remember one time I looked out and I saw on the <span class="DLF">fence</span> two bodies hanging on the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">These people were hung > <span class="DLF">roll call grounds</span> (German) there during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Just — they wanted — and shot — I mean they were no longer living, but they let them hang there so that we could see 1t — what would happen to us if we maybe not obey. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">From the regular work you could be sometimes selected to do some special work like maybe cleaning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pit toilets</span> or, or doing something around outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Like one time I remember I was picked out to go with one of the SS and a couple of other prisoners to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We had to pick up something and we had to load it on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , on this big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">There was no extra food. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">There was no, not even a sip of water that we would get but we were asked to stand by as the SS was feeding the horse the sugars out of his hand and we could watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">That was a treat for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But it was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It was very hard because you were always so hungry and there was, there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I mean that was one of the terrible things that not only were you mistreated but you also were so hungry all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And I didn't know because I didn't have a mirror, I didn't know how I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But my father always told me towards the end of the war, towards the end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , he said I was very puffed up, that I had hunger, I had hunger-edema. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">You know, you've seen these little children from Asia who were blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Well, I wasn't so little anymore but I was — had this and it, it was really very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">If you were sick during that time, 1t was very bad because not like in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> where there was still the possibility of being in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> specially you, you, you still were treated a little bit more humanely. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But if you really got sick in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , that was a very bad thing.</span></p>

Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Can I just drink? </span><span class="sentence" id="333">That she, that she would arrange that we would leave by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and go outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She told us that the next morning we would have to go through a thorough cleansing job. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">By the way, we were many times taken to this "<span class="INT_SPACE">cleansing bath</span> ," so to speak — I want to back — track a minute on that, and taken there because we were full of lice all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">But we had to take off our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They were put into a big machine or something like that, in a container and which supposedly was heated up so that 1t should kill these lice but they never were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They were only worse every time that when you got your clothes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And meantime you went — had to go to a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower bath</span> and the SS — male and female — were, we were totally naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We were standing around. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They was standing there talking to one another, laughing their head off that we were all standing there in — with nothing on helplessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And then they sent us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I remember one time standing in the snow with the shoes on, no clothes whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The snow was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">It was freezing cold; and we had to wait for those de-liced, so-called de-liced clothing, which always came back with the lice crawling more on it because they never heated it up enough; and they said they had to re-do it because the lice weren't killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So we were standing for a couple of hours before we got our clothes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Now we had this experience, and we thought, “Oh no, we'll get again the same story,” which we really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But at the same time they also wanted us to throw away all the — whatever we had which could be used against the Germans as a document. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">For some reason I have few little documents left. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They must have been in some seams or hidden away or in a pocket they didn't see because when I remember — when I entered this, this <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where, where the people were processed, it was littered with paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was littered with clothing, with lice crawling over it and we were supposed to keep only what was on our bodies and as we went off we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> after this whole procedure and we thought, ““Was she telling the truth?” </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We didn't know whether we could trust her or not and as we walked again through the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">birch forest</span> and we came out and we saw—it was a cold month—we saw the steam coming up, this, this smoke rising into the <span class="DLF">sky</span> and sure enough.... We could not believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We could not believe that there was really a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> standing, which was apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and every <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> was heated. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We were living in cold <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for so long we didn't even know what a nice comfortable <span class="INT_SPACE">warm room</span> felt like. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I mean, in this case, the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Well, we came into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we could not believe it either, because they came around and gave us something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And said that we would go towards the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> , that from there on we would be exchanged against the German prisoners — not prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I mean, the German people who were outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And they wished us, so to speak, a good trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Well, we were started to roll and roll and we came across <span class="REGION">areas</span> where just before we had arrived there was a bombardment. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Because already during that time the Germans — the Allies had advanced into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and there were also occasionally bombardments of various <span class="REGION">areas</span> which was strategically important to the Allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And we were held back at various <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> because the train rails had to be repaired and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And we, we made a terrible detour, I remember, because suddenly we saw that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and we couldn't understand it. “</span><span class="sentence" id="365">If we go directly to the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> how come we are going through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we got very anxious and suspicious again. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But, indeed, we, we came through <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> and we were heading towards the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Well, as you can imagine, people who had lived through that were not — their health was not the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And there was one person in particular, I remember we stopped at a certain <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and his body — he had died during the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride and his body was taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and probably taken to the morgue of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we had stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">As we approached the Dutch — the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> , the SS stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at a certain point and called people who were responsible from the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They assigned certain people — one of them was my dad — they called them out and told them that they had to tell us that only a small number of the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were going really to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">That we were in such a bad condition that we — they did not want us — to send us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I guess they had a little feeling of shame left or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We ended up in a — in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> actually, and made one military person responsible for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It was — we were assigned actually there for a couple of nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Quite nice <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And we — they gave us something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">It wasn't very much, but we, we didn't have to starve during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Wasn't too much — it was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It wasn't too much, because our body and stomach didn't tolerate any more food really. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But what we were not quite sure of — what were they going to do with us? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Where were we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We knew that the war was towards an end, but we did not know — until the day we left we were not informed that they had negotiated with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to send us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Because the reason <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> didn't say, "Yes, send them," they couldn't do it right away because the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were even further damaged and the communication — lines of communication were severed. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So that it would have been an eternal ride on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , probably escaping from here to there. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Instead, they decided they would put us into an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> for the time being. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And so we, we ended up in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> ; and in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> were people from the islands of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guernsey</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jersey</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Germans had occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guernsey</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jersey</span> , and had interned most of its citizens in, in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">One of them was that camp where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">During that time when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> it was very close to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Was more illness, more — there was more help available for us because people had supplies from the British Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They were trying to de-louse us, cut off the hair because we were just full with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They gave us some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They had to share — could share with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We were getting a little more fed and a little oriented where we were, what happened to us; and on April the 23rd, 1945, the French Army liberated us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  What was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We couldn't believe that this.... We had hoped always that the war would end and that this would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">But when it happened, it was so, so unbelievable that we should suddenly have our freedom again. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Although we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we didn't like that idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Free. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And there were many — quite a number of weeks went by when we had to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then we were, had to go to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRRA camp</span> .</span></p>

but we also knew that we had wanted to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So we had to, to make a plan to use <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> only as a temporary place of, of, of sojourn, that we had to hopefully get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was not possible for us at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was more, more likely for us at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was a matter of time, everything, but we had already so much times waited and spent and suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We, we wanted already to arrive somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">There was a possibility for me to go much earlier than my father, because I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And the German quota to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was much smaller because the Americans rightfully did not want the Germans to at that time to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They had to be de-Nazified, or they wanted to make sure who it was so the only German-born people were essentially a few exception scientists and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And the German-born Jews, because that quota was more open. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">My father, who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , had to wait much longer than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I was able to get to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in 194— end of 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">This was nearly three years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Oh, longer — more than three years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And after a few months in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I finally was able to get a visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And the nice part of this was that when we had left — when we tried to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in 1940, we were going to go with the Holland-America line to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And we had booked the tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And the man who was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , for some reason because of my father's work he knew my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , after I had gotten my visa in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , I said, "Well, let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I go by the <span class="DLF">Holland- America line</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I had no money, really, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ; but I went there, and I said, "Let me try." </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I said — I go in there and I said — I told my story, that I had left — was supposed to leave that time, that I never used the ticket and 1s it possible to use it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And so the clerk to whom I spoke said, "Just a minute." </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And he went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the head of this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , the director;
