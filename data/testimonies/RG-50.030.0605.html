<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  So they apparently thought you were talented as well?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Because of the dance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Because of that boy's phone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But it was a different time, and those people were different people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Mmhmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  And it was three stories, one on top of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It wasn't very wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There was no indoor plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But it was still summer, so it was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">After awhile, that didn't seem to be a solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they stuck me with a vicar in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lockerley</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Why did they move you to the vicar?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I wasn't always consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It seemed that you didn't really bond with those people that you stayed with, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Never, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And the people that the lady there, the vicaress, if there is such a word, there isn't, but the lady, she had four daughters, and her husband was not allowed to smoke in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He smoked a pipe. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">His sermons were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I had enough English by then, but I went to the sermons. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> when they had services because it was the only entertainment then. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">After that, somehow was it a joint committee who used to transfer people? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You don't know about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Yeah, that is somewhat obscure, but I think that's
ANSWER:  It's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And they moved me on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North Hampton</span> where I got stuck for awhile longer, and there was a curate who took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Curate 1s an assistant vicar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  And she was a very glamorous lady, and he was a very sweet man. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Their name was Evans. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And so I stayed with them, again being sent to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I don't think it really knocked in, you know, kicked 1n at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  It didn't?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But anyhow, it was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">It was tiresome. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Among the other interesting things, this may interest you, your group, there was a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And because in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North Hampton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And he wore a clerical collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I don't know if anybody else ever told you that, but it 1s a very unusual thing for a rabbi to do, but he said the other clergyman, they wore a clerical collar, so he did too. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">This was an edification on his part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That is actually pretty unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Mighty unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  So okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So I spent some time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And then my mother kept running to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> she was by that time she had come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, anyway, my mother kept going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And somehow I don't know how that all worked out, but they found out that when I was born, my father was an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for 25 or so years. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to visit relatives after World War I, met my mother in doesn't matter where <span class="REGION">Quebec</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  That's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But at least we are coming back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  In the meantime, the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">There was a new law on the books, the Nationality Act of 1940, and that because when I was born, my father was an American citizen, I could be an American citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Well, that was a good thing at the time.</span></p>
