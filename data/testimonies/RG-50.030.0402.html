<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  My parents had married after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My father had been a front soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And of course when Hitler came, he said that some soldiers, Jewish men who had fought for the <span class="REGION">Fatherland</span> , they would be not hurt in any way, which of course was a lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My father was a very prominent lawyer, made a lot of money, we lived very nicely and comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He was also, as a lawyer, not prepared to move to a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with different law. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">A doctor can move anywhere, learn the language and check the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My father, by the time we got here was 60, and he -- he did -- his English was pretty grim. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So there he -- we all had to start over. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Now, before we get here, let me tell you where it began.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Could we begin also by having you say the -- the name of your mother and the name of your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  The full name --
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Q -- and your mother’s maiden name, if you know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My father was Mac Zellner. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My mother’s name was Gertrude Markus, M-a-r-k-u-s. She was one of the first women who got a doctor’s degree, at a time when most of them didn’t even have <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , she started at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Breslau</span> , and had a PhD. She never used it, too bad, but she -- she was a very intelligent woman, and that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My father studied law in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he was just a young lawyer when he was drafted into the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">After he came back, he met my mother and they were married very shortly after. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">You know, after the war, there’s always -- the men come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the same thing after this war, they want to settle down. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We were two children, I am Ruth, my sister who was younger, was Margaret. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And we lived in a plain <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the beginning, because you couldn’t get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Then we had a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And we were beginning to look to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We did get a visa from my father’s cousin, whose parents had come to the States already, we didn’t know her. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But, as I said, the Polish quota was oversubscribed by that time in ’37 or so when we started looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">You just couldn’t get on it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So we looked around to see if there was any <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we could wait, like for instance, <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  I-I want to spend a little more time on your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Do you know anything about your grandparents from either <span class="NPIP">side</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Do you remember them, do you know their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  My father’s parents had died long before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I somewhere have a little family tree, but it’s not very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They must have been born early in the previous century. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My mother’s parents I knew, but they too -- my grandfather died very early of a gallbladder operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">My grandmother, we had to leave her behind, because she was old and a little weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We couldn’t have left with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So wi -- my parents took her into a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , paid forever, and one thing I really like to mention that, we had a lovely cook with us forever, she was a very devoted Catholic lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And when my grandmother went to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , she rearranged for her to have a job there, so my grandmother had somebody who was familiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">What we were told 1s that she died in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I hope it’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I come back to that life -- cook of ours later. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">As a -- my childhood was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">When things became difficult, I left the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I was, because these were the daughters of the big shots of Nazis, and my parents sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> run by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The teachers were not nuns or anything, but they were [indecipherable] with everybody was from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">There were quite a few Jewish kids there. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">In the beginning when we came, the teacher would come in [indecipherable] crystals, I don’t know if you understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">When Hitler came, heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So that wasn’t so great after awhile, but they were very dedicated to helping the Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But in ’37, things became too uncomfortable, and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I still measure [indecipherable] I don’t know what -- if you know what that is, it’s a little more than the metric. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Some of my children from my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> got two years credit in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> here for what -- our exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Many of those who got a lot of credit were veterans. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So they, of course, they were very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">When I sent my paper to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> I think it was, they didn’t get too hysterical about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I didn’t get credit, but I never studied for credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I only took the courses I needed for my work. [</span><span class="sentence" id="79">indecipherable] jumped ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Then, in ’39, we were told that the -- no, I think I want to tell you about the 10" of November, that was the Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  But before we get there, I'd like to spend a little bit more time on your childhood, and your schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You just mentioned that when you were younger, you went to -- you implied that you went to a mixed school of Germans that were non-Jews, and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Could you tell us more about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">How did the children get along?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Before Hitler, fine, they didn’t know the difference, you had friends all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Once Hitler came, those who were your friends, were your friends, but they wouldn’t invite you any more, you wouldn’t invite them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was difficult, it got stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The last year that I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , I was the only Jewish girl in my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Lunchtime, nobody talked to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I was -- it wasn’t that they didn't like me, but they were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Their fathers had positions in the Nazi party, and she has a Jewish girlfriend? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They couldn’t take the chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But by that time, I was 17, and I really didn’t like it there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">As a matter of fact, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where the children of the <span class="BUILDING">em-embassies</span> , American, English, would go and learn English, and speak -- get their own education, the British education. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I wanted to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I thought that would be the right thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My parents didn’t want me to do that because they thought if there’s a quick emigration, I’d be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , they’d be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They said, if you don’t want to be in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I was very happy there, I was one -- one among equals. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I was relaxed, we had a lot of fun, until th-the Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  H-How did you -- how did you understand what was beginning to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Did your parents speak to you about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Did you speak with your parents when you got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , for instance from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  I had the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They said this paper is not in the national interest, it will be suspended for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Well the two weeks are 60 years now. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So I mean, I saw what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Also, you had all these Hitler talks on the radio, and were -- this was a very noisy way of controlling people, they were marching along. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But it did not really affect me so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , we had our own <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So what did I care? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And that -- there was a -- a th-theater group, Jewish, concert Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So the last year, when Hitler really was getting going, it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cocoon</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Which I didn’t even mind, I was too young, I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There were nice boys, there were nice girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So what’s wrong with that? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And as I said, y -- that came to the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Until that time, life was okay, I knew I would be leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and everybody wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But there was no hardship yet, thank God, that came after we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  C-Can you talk a little bit about homelife, even before Kristallnacht, really, the early 30’s, the mid-1930’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Wh-What was it like to be in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">What was your mother like? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">How -- how did your family spend time together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  It’s -- to tell you the truth, I took it so for granted, that I can hardly tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was a big nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I -- in -- I remember once I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I had a shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">When you took your dirty boots off, they didn’t come back clean by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The cook did it, so -- I took that for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Th-There were so many things that I later thought, gee whiz [indecipherable] spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I was not spoiled, because we were told to clean our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , to do this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But still and all, I remember one of the girls, one Jewish said to me, “This 1s a nice pin, 1s it real?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="132">I wouldn’t wear costume jewelry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And you know, these things stay with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And one of the girls -- and also, as I said, before Hitler, invited me to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I said, “Mom, you say these people are poor, they have five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , we only have six.” </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So my mother said, “How big were the five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">As big as our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You know, it -- that’s why when you asked me, it seemed so terrible away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I lived in the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And of course, anything I wanted I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">When te -- again my parents trained me. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I know I wanted to have a writing thing like this, you know, with envelopes and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I bought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But it was 15 marks maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">My father said, “No. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Poor children have to live on that for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You return it, and you get your money back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So I knew you can’t just buy anything you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But what you needed, you got plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So if you must -- 1f you remember my life before Hitler, if somebody who lived not on Park or <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , but on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Upper East Side</span> , going to the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that you knew and knowing the people you were supposed to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But when you are 12 13, you are not [indecipherable] very often, nowadays they are more than then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Can you tell us some about your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">A-A-A-Again, during this pre-Hitler time, before a lot of anxiety had come about for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Well, my father was very well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He wrote a column for the newspaper about anything new in laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">When the laws was the -- not Hitler law, he had a reserved column, whenever he wanted to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He had the clients from here to there, very important cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He was a very charming man, and a very good speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So he would tell socially anecdote about all the doctors and lawyers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">He was very well known at the -- by the judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">His word counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I don’t know if I should tell you one case that’s really -- by that time Hitler was [indecipherable] already. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">There was a couple, an Austrian woman and a German man, and the laws were that -- I have to get this -- they wanted to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And the laws are, you have to go by the marriage laws of your <span class="REGION">home country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The woman was Austrian and Catholic, and couldn’t divorce and marry that man. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So they had many cases, I mean, they tried it, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Then my father got the case, and my father, as a Jew said, I think I have an angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It is important to the German country to have strong German children. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">If you keep that woman from marrying the man, having children, then it is against the national interest and the Austrian law should not apply. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My father won the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The judge said, “As a Jew, you really made a case.” </span><span class="sentence" id="173">My father said, “I’m a lawyer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The joke was, she was over 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">No children. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It’s just one of the stories that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But I mean, he had an angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He knew what -- and it -- he wasn’t sarcastic, he had a client and he worked for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He also said -- and that is very different from lawyers here, for every marriage, divorce, he reunited half the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He said it is not right to take money if you can protect a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Another thing I remember from my father as a young lawyer, he worked -- he was associated with a much older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They went for a com -- how shall I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It was -- it [indecipherable] of a contract they were working on. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They spent five hours on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Eventually they hashed it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">My father and his mentor went back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The older man opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> , took out the contract which was almost exactly what they came to. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He had written that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And he said to my father, when you argue with people, or have a contract with them, you’ve got to remember their point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">You don’t say it in the beginning, but you have to know how far you can come to make them meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I wish they had it now in a few <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So, I mean, my father had a very solid background, but my mother said she used to go to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> when he was pleading, sit in the back and monitor it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">She would tell him what the reaction was of the people, also whether his voice carried. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I would have loved to go because I was always fascinated by the law, and as a kid I was reading all his law books. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Some of them weren’t so kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I mean, some of them had things there that [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So I learned a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I used to tell the other kids what was going on, you know, things that nowadays you read it in every book, but in those days -- my parents didn’t mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They always felt that what I can learn, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">As a matter of fact, I had a reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">My mother used to say -- and then 40 years later the people in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> said it, you cannot keep secrets from Ruth. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My mother said to my father, “If -- she will always find out and tell everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But if you tell her it’s a secret, she not say peep.” </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And that was from when I was 12 til I was 80. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Well, it was funny.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  Can you speak some about the role of faith in your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The role of religion in your family?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  The role of religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1040">ANSWER:  You know, the whole thing is like a blur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">You lived one day and you wondered, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">You lived for the bulletin, and you hope th-that what anybody said didn’t mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">You just didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I know that the bulletins were in English and in German because my father say people misunderstand the English one, they don’t know enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Now there was one bulletin, there is still hope it -- to land in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">That still was not a negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So my father translated it to there 1s hope to la -- I mean, in German without [indecipherable] you know, with the flavor of this [indecipherable] because they looked like eh -- so that was -- that was all we did, watch what every -- we got telegrams maybe three, four times a day from Europe Jewish community, from American community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">They collected an awful lot of money, which they had been prepared to give to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And what nobody could understand, why the Cuban didn’t just take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">but it was a matter of principle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I think they were afraid of the Nazis, of the Hitler people there, because there was a very large underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And they were afraid if they displeased them, it would topple their government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">You know how governments get toppled.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">QUESTION:  So -- and you began to tell me about that sh -- that -- that ride to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Wh-What was it like when you docked there, and where did you dock?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  Well, when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we had no chance to do anything, they did for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">There was -- they called it the <span class="BUILDING">Rowan house</span> , that took care of refugee, they ar -- are -- it’s when we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> we were given a number by one of the -- I guess, social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">She said, this is the number of your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train car</span> , and this is the number of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that will meet you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So that’s what we did, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> took us to a little pension, you know a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , mostly students were there, and we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> arranged for by the <span class="BUILDING">Rowan house</span> for one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And my father [indecipherable] got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">My mother asked if we could stay longer, they said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">They probably thought we were just telling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">In the meantime we found out that my uncle from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> had arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and we found out where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And we went -- he was in what you call a brownstone, I don’t know what they have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they have the refurnished brownstone houses, and the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> are rented out to people, each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- not <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And he and his wife and son had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and here -- the landlady gave my parents a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but she had no other <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , she said she would in two weeks, and my sister and I were in another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that belonged to her, under the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">It was slanted attic and there we were, and what impressed me was, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , where in daylight, 1t was pitch dark and in 15 minutes was bright sunshine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">That was near the equator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , dawn and dusk were [indecipherable | especially during the war when they had daylight saving, you could read at 11 o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So there we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and after a month, I got a job doing millinery work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I put labels into the hat, by appointment to her majesty the queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I’m sure she never wore my hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I wasn’t very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And then came the war, September ’39 [indecipherable] arrived in June. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1080">indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">By August we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I went sightseeing on Saturday after work, but most of the things were buried already for safekeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Children were taken away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Things were getting ready, but not as ready as they should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">When the war started, I was working in that <span class="BUILDING">millinery</span> , and one of the girls said, did you know that trouble had started? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And I said, trouble, does that mean war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">She says, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">So in those let -- last few days the ambassadors went back and forth, but then it was war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">They called it the blitzkrieg, they thought the Germans would come like this, which didn’t happen, and they made fun of it and called it the sitzkrieg, they were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">But by April -- my <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> kicked me out, they weren’t busy any more and me he could do without. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And in the spring, of course, Hitler ran over <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And at that time, the English were afraid that among the refugees there would be Nazis hiding as refugee, and all -- most of the men were put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , my father, and everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">So he was -- I think it was the Isle of Mann where he was, from June, July, August, September, three month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">In the meantime the blitz had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Every night the bombs came down when it got dark until it got daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And of course as the la -- nights got longer, the bombs went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">We -- I know we were- one time we were standing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , sitting there, and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was shaking, and I was thinking, I hope the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> will stay up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">If the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> stays up we’ll be alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Then, after the all clear, you went around looking what <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> weren’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And my father came back in September, and he managed to get passage for us to come to the State, which was very hard to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I mean, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were being sunk, and they needed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> and went on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Blackout. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">You couldn’t go on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> with [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">doors</span> , because you know, you couldn’t even smoke on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> because a light carries very far in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">We had air raid alarms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Mostly they were just tests, but sometimes you could hear <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , and you didn’t really know where, what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">So we went -- I think it took about more than two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">There were three groups of people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Children with their mothers or their nannies, that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> for safekeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And some refugees, and a whole batch of young men who just came on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">No paper, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Well, what we find out, we were full -- I think two full crews for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , which Roosevelt had promised Churchill cash and carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">They picked up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and take them back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So, I remember one thing, everything was blackout and no -- no identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And when we were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> , there was a fog and an old English man said, well, when the king and queen came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> , they were befogged too, so it’s all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And I was standing on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> with some guy and we saw the captain come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">We hadn’t seen him before, because I mean, it was a heck of a job getting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And he was looking up and saluting, and we saw it was the Union Jack wave, and that meant we were in <span class="REGION">Canadian waters</span> , and we’d done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Now that moment I will never forget, because on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , you [indecipherable] you never got undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">You had your lifebelt, you had your winter coat, and your boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">You had to have the winter coat in case you went into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">You had to be able to throw it off in case you went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Same thing with the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I mean, that was another scary ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">I didn’t take a cruise until years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">But we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> , we -- they took on foo - food, and oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And then we sailed down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I didn’t see the Statue of Liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">We had to be showing our papers downstairs, and when we got off, there was a man from the HIAS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I don’t know if you know that [indecipherable] on Esther Place, I think it’s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">They would take newcomers in who had nobody to meet them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Most of them had some relatives, we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So he took us down to the HIAS, and that was really scary, I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">We were sitting there, they told us to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">It was it -- two days before Thanksgiving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And the two men came over from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And my parent -- my sister and one of the guys went out one <span class="DLF">door</span> for a little walk, and I went out another <span class="DLF">door</span> with that guy who was very scruvy looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Unshaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">He walked me around and around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I said, I want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">He wanted to sh -- he wanted to show me something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I was say, gee whiz, I can’t even tell the cops where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I didn’t have an address, what was going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">But he wanted to show me Woolworth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">In those days, for one dollar, you could buy candies, and stocking, and stationery, everything was a dime or 15 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I was overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Then he took me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">But it -- it’s very uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">So we were in the -- that was Tuesday we arrived, Wednesday we went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> where the Jewish organizations were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I was very disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> in daylight was very scruffy, even then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And the woman who took our particulars said we should come back on Monday because tomorrow is Thanksgiving, we won’t work, and Friday we don’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">What was Thanksgiving, we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">So she gave an -- an appointment for Monday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And I -- my sister and I, we went back to the HIAS, and my parents went to see that cousin, and -- who invited us for Thanksgiving dinner next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">There were all kinds of family there, a big to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I don’t know if you know -- your -- “Life With Father’? </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">You don’t know the play? </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">That was new at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">A whole string of redheads, Irish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And when we came in, they said, the Irish fam -- “Life With Father”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">We didn’t know what it was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So we met a cousin of mine and he took us out, and he said he had a friend who was in the <span class="BUILDING">employment agency</span> of the [indecipherable] and we should go there, and she introduced us, we had coffee with her, and she said we should come on Monday and see if we could get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">So we were there on Tuesday, on Monday we had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">It was a -- two Viennese men were making gloves for the Army and Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And my sister sat on a little machine and made all those fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">You had to make, I think 10 dozen pairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">You didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">It was piecework. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And we were still in the HIAS because we -- everybody told us to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">They said it would be better in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a small community would take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">My sister and I, we sat there and my sister, she was a tough noodle, she sat next to the fastest person and matched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">She became the fastest one in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I wasn’t bad, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">So in those days, the minimum was 10 dollars a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And she and I each made 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">That was a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And my -- we took work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for my mother to finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with big bags of gloves, and she finished it and we took them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I mean, she didn't work all night, it’s the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And so she earned some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">My father had all kinds of funny jobs in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">He was working for a <span class="BUILDING">dental lab</span> , delivering the false teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">That’s for the lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">But he was really terrific, he did whatever came, and after awhile he got a job as a bookkeeper, where he stayed the rest of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So between 18 and 18 and maybe my mother eight, my father maybe 12, that was, in those time, livable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">But of course, we bought yesterday’s bread, was cheaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I went to my first movie after one year, on my birthday somebody took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">A date was an ice cream soda with two straws. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I mean, it took doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And at first I could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I was war work, so you had to work long hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And once they did -- somebody told the Army and Navy, knitted gloves are no good, they wanted a -- what we made were liv -- knitted gloves with leather palm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">But they wanted leather gloves with lining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">All the soldiers in the ar -- [indecipherable] said ours are better, we have a better grip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">But, government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">So we didn't have government work any more, we made gloves for skiing, and that gave me a chance to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And I went -- I don’t know if you know it, on <span class="DLF">Lexington Ave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">in [indecipherable] is part of <span class="BUILDING">City College</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Brandeis Institute</span> , that’s for business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I didn’t take credit, but I learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">You know, auditor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And when I thought I was ready, I started in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , very much at the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I worked my way up, and my sister got married, and my father died in ’56. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">He died on the last day when he retired, he didn’t come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">He collapsed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">We didn’t know where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">But eventually I co -- went to the police and declared him missing, and they found him in the <span class="BUILDING">Roosevelt hospital</span> , he died the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">That’s where that doctor was who thought he was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">So that’s how it went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1210">QUESTION:  Why did that doctor think your father was a Nazi?</span></p>
