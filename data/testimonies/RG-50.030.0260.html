<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well, in 1939, we were invaded by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Two years later, I think in the month of June,’ we were invaded by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And ... six months we stayed in our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then they took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .* </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which it was towards, towards some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was like the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They gave us one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Can I go one second before, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And, actually, I wanted to hear a little bit about before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Your memories of when the Germans came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Well, the Germans came in, and my father, He, as I said before, he was a barber. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He worked in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in his own <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So food, we had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He used to bring in from the peasants who -- those years, they didn't have those shaving things that you shave yourself and you threw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I mean, they had to come to a barber to take a shave, and to take a haircut. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">As a matter of fact, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the war in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my father worked in his own <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> for the Germans, because they needed him for this particular reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They couldn't shave themselves, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They needed a barber. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And after six months being in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they told us that we’re going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and this is where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> 's going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Where there were two <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , so they took up the area of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and they, they, segregated with barbed wire -- it was extremely tall barbed wires -- and a peasant next-door neighbor came. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My father told him to and asked him *The Germans entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lachva</span> on July 8, 1941. “</span><span class="sentence" id="79">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lachva</span> was established on April 1, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">to, and they came and they put us, whatever little belongings -- we took very little, and they put us in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , we were six people, and I was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I didn't want to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I remember when I left my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I looked back and I cried my -- as little as I was, as young as I was, I knew I'll never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I cried my eyes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They gave us aroom. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I mean, one of my -- my father requested it, that they gave it to us just because he worked in this <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> , and he knew a lot of German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So they gave us -- there were two families in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , very small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And we slept like two, three in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We were six people, and there was another other two people, also a barber, but only two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There was no family, they elderly people. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And my mother never took me down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I never saw how the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for about ... at least 20 families, 15 families. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So I guess they didn't want children there just to take up the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And there was really nothing much to cook there, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Whatever, as far as I could remember, whatever my father used to smuggle in through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , because in the morning he used to go to work, come back at night, as a barber. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So he used to hide on him something, because you, you were not allowed to smuggle in any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So he used to hide, let’s say a piece of fish or a piece of bread, or a piece of potato to smuggle in, they shouldn't see it on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And this we lived on. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And then I saw my mother was swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I said to my mother, I said, "Why are you so swollen?" </span><span class="sentence" id="102">She was only 36 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">She said, "Nothing, nothing, nothing." </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But then I find out that what she did whatever food she had, she gave it to the kids, and she never ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And she got swollen, and then she had also an olderly mother who lived with her older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And they had nothing because they couldn't go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to bring in any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So they had to live on whatever they gave them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And the little kids died of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">There were little ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And my grandma was dying, so she used to send me whatever she had to give it to grandma. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Finally, she died a hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I came one day with the food, and I saw her laying against the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they lived in, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I don't know how long she was laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">There was -- they didn't give any funerals or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They just took her away, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">This is how we lived for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">At least six -- between six and eight months, I think it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Did you have any activities, or did you just stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="121"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  I -- there was -- I did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I went to -- I actually worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They used to send me, they used to send my mother, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But my mother was a pretty woman, and one German was after her. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So instead of her, I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">What was my work? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My work was to dig <span class="DLF">graves</span> for other people, so they used to pick us up like ... half'a day, like 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock, and bring us back like in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we used to dig those long, long, long <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Long, long, long -- I didn't know what it, what it was for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">This was night after night and mother was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the younger kids and with my grandma and this was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But as far as I hear, there was no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> but they did -- it was some kind of a little activity there. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">There was little activities there, but I really don't know what it was because I never went. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">In my girlfriend's book, she, she knows more details. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But it was something -- she had an older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But I think that it was -- life was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There people were in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Some of even got married, I've heard, later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Like just a huppa”, you know, or something and some kind of a life, but people were dying of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">In six months, eight months, people were dying of hunger.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Outside of different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , not our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">What they did, the Germans, they used to send from those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> to dig our <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , we dug different, from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And that's what I used to do, until, until one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Were you aware of the governing structure in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the Jewish Council and all that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Not much, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There was a committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I have all the names written down there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But if you can just tell me as much as you remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You don't have to name names, but ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  Did you know people involved with the underground?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I knew the people who was -- they were on the committee in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I have all the names written down. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I have all the names.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  The reason I'm asking this is, I mean, you know that in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> sometimes the Jewish Councils were not so -- I mean, they had to do their jobs, and they weren't -- they often followed the German orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They weren't as sympathetic to an underground activity because they were afraid, I guess, for themselves.</span></p>
