QUESTION:  What did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Uh my father owned a <span class="BUILDING">junior department store</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Originally he worked as a salesman and slowly improved himself and was opened, able to open his own <span class="BUILDING">business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">He was, he was selling ladies sports clothes and uh my mother worked in the business with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">She used to style the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">At that time uh there was no wholesale buying and all the inventory used to be produced by seamstresses who used to come to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> after it was closed in the evening and my mother used to give them out the work and discuss the various fashions and they did, did the work at their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and used to bring it back and this 1s the way we we acquired inventory. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And my mother used to go once in a while to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to get some styles, to copy styles and and she was working hand-in-hand with my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  What was what was your family life like as a child, growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Well, the general situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> before the 2nd World War - <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> was an independent <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from 1918 to 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And even though there was some anti-Semitism prevalent, the Jewish people had had many cultural activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We we had many <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We had <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museums</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theaters</span> and a very active cultural and social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">my father and mother worked very very hard in order to provide a decent standard of living to the family and give their children the best possible education. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We went to <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> . , </span><span class="sentence" id="19">as a matter of fact <span class="BUILDING">private German schools</span> until 1933 when Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Then all the Jewish people demonstratively took their children out of the <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> and I started attending the Hebrew 01:03: <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Gymnasion Ivrith, and I visited the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was attending the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My brother went to a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was called <span class="BUILDING">Ezra School</span> which was also, was not Hebrew but it was also diversified in various languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And we we had a very interesting social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We belonged to a Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">we were very much interested in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and most of our young people used to volunteer to go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> whenever possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we were strong supporters of the Zionist movement at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Our social life was very active and we had really had a nice a nice growing up period. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And all this of course changed when in 1940, when the Soviet Union occupied our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">overnight things were not the same anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">first of all my father lost his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was no private enterprise allowed under any circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">One day somebody came into our business and asked my father for the key and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And my father had to go and work in the <span class="BUILDING">lumber factory</span> , after all those years trying to build the business and provide a future for his family - all of a sudden everything was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">All our Zionist organizations were closed immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was forbidden to have any kind of nationalist groups under threat of incarceration. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Even the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> were closed because the Soviet Union does not recognize Hebrew as as a Jewish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That that is nationalist and anything which is nationalist is forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So life changed dramatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">In addition they they arrested five thousand prominent Jewish families from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and sent them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , their only crime being that they were capitalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They had large business and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And that took all of 1940 until 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">we had heard, we had heard already about things transpiring in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We had heard rumor about persecution against Jews, even Jews being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and all that, but nobody really believed that these things would lead eventually to mass murder or mass persecutions against Jews, so when when the war finally broke out on the end of June, June 22nd, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declared war on the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">the German army swept through the <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span> , within eight days occupied the <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span> and there was very little time to make up one's mind whether to stay behind or to leave with the retreating Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We had a discussion about it in our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and my father felt very very strongly that it is a temporary situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Yes, there might be some privileges which will be taken away from the Jews and there might be a certain amount of persecutions, but nobody in their right mind could ever imagine what was to come, so my father said we're going to stick it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We're going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So we did - that's the reason why we stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Some of our friends left with the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">the men were taken immediately into the Army and most of them died fighting the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Some of them were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Some of them were sent to <span class="REGION">inner Russia</span> and some of them survived and came back after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The minute the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and particularly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> on July Ist, 1941, the Latvian population, the Latvian civilian population, turned against their neighbors, the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Anti-Semitism, as I said, was always prevalent, but the year occupation by the Soviet Union increased anti-Semitism by so much because as usual the Jews were used as a scapegoat and the Latvian civilian population accused the Jews of being the culprit of bringing communism to their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And that is why immediately, when the Russians pulled out, the German civilian population started persecution, persecuting Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They, before even the Germans had a chance to institute any kind of change, the the Latvians used to sweep through the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , used to drag people out, used to murder, plunder, rape, everything, in the last, even the last the first few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">In this, in the first few weeks, our family was lucky because we had a maid who was living with us and she used to go out and do all the shopping for us, so we didn't have to venture into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , which was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And she used to go buy food for us and and help us as much as she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But then came out orders that every Jew was supposed to wear the star, the yellow star of David, left front and center back. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And we were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Like cattle we were driven into the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Not allowed to go to <span class="DLF">parks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Not allowed anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was a very very sad and nervous time because Jews were continuously, continuously arrested, taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Most of them never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Few later, a few weeks later, an order came out that all Jews have to get ready to be moved from their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> into specially designated <span class="REGION">area</span> called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was supposed to be in a dilapidated section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where about four thousand poor Russian and Polish families lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They vacated the <span class="REGION">premises</span> and in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> thirty thousand Jews were brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">All we all we were allowed to take is what we could carry in small little hand-driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">By October we all were supposed to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  How did your family prepare to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Well, we knew that there was really no possibility for us to do anything but to follow orders because the majority, the overwhelming majority of the Latvian civilian population, didn't have any kind of feelings for their neighbors, the Jews who who who who were struck with this particular disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And there was no chance of getting help from anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So when the day came, we just, sad as it was, packed up a few little things which we could carry and we - I remember the day very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was about a mile and a half from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and we carried a few pieces each and had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> which we pushed and took a few bare necessities, what we could carry, and we made the transition from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of course, the situation was disastrous because we had to share - in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we were assigned a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to share with another family. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">One <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a two or three room apartment usually was occupied by six or seven families. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was guarded on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> by the Latvian military guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> a civilian administration which was in charge of the sanitation, in charge of police, employment agency and whatever, and every morning people used to line up and the German or Latvian guards came and took people to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">At night they used to bring them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">my mother, my brother and I were working at that time for a German police unit called BDO, which 1s translated into German: "Befehlshaber der Ordnungspolizei". </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We were, my brother and I were doing menial labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My mother was working for the for the chief in in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She cooking for his family, which enabled her once in a while to get some extra food to help to support the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My father of course stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he did the the the menial chores in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in so far and so at night we used to come back, but all this took a very very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That is from October till November. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">On November 27th, the orders came out that people who live in a certain section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> supposed to line up on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> the next morning and they will be sent to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And of course all kinds of rumors started sweeping the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Nobody was sure what's to come and everybody was concerned and worried and but then, after lining up on the 27th, they sent every...everybody <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But a day later, on the 29th, thousands of Latvian and German police came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , drunk, most of them drunk - shooting, chasing everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Raus. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Everybody raus. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Schnell, schnell. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They chased everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Whoever couldn't walk was shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Children, women, elderly men, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And German officers were walking around and telling the elderly and the weak and the ones who couldn't walk very well that they will provide transportation for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They, it would be much easier for them and they provided special blue <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">At that time we did not know what was happening to them, but they were chased through certain sections of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumbola</span> and there Russian prisoners of war had prepared large <span class="DLF">graves</span> , <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> , and when the people got there they were told to undress, put their shoe in one pile their shoes in one pile, clothing in another pile, driven to the edges of this <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> , and machine-gunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was going on all night and the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Fifteen thousand of our people were massacred in that particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My brother and I were taken with a group of other men and told to go to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they established a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of four thousand able-bodied men, and we were immediately separated from the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My father chose to stay at that time with my mother, but somehow - they lived in a different part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so they were spared the first murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It didn't last long however, and on December 8th, they started the same thing all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And my father came over to visit my my brother and myself, wanted to go back and all of a sudden they closed, they closed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he was stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He couldn't go back to my mother because he really wanted to be with my mother, so that's how my father stayed with us, and that particular day my mother with most of the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Another eleven thousand, five hundred were massacred. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">There was another small Aktion the next day of five hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">There were within a very short time, two weeks, twenty-seven thousand people massacred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  How did you hear about your mother's death and what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well, as a matter of fact we, even after it happened, we were not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There were all kinds of rumors circulating what had happened to them, because the civilian population we didn't have any contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We didn't know for sure what was happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">All we knew that my mother was taken away in the second aktion with another eleven thousand five hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We were still hoping against hope that maybe it was some kind of a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> where she was taken to. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Nobody was sure but but after a while, the the real picture started emerging - that it it was just a disaster, that they were just murdered and there was no hope of anybody coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And of course my father and us were totally devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">A lot of tears, a lot of crying, saying kaddish after my mother, but really there was not, nothing nothing much one could do at those those at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I remember while they were taking out those people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I was standing behind the barbed wire and I saw those wild animals, those drunk Latvian and German soldiers beating, killing in the most brutal and barbaric way. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I saw a woman walking with a child, with a baby in her arms, and somehow she slipped and the baby fell out of her arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The Latvian policeman grabbed the baby, held it by its legs and put a bullet through the head, and when the mother started pleading with him and crying, he shot the mother on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I saw that just in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So when I saw that I had no doubt in my mind what was happening to our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And it was the futility of the situation which made me raise my eyes to the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , say my God, it just cannot be. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Human beings cannot do that to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It's just impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Day had turned to night. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">People became worse than animals, blood-thirsty without any pity, any feelings for their fellow human beings, and the Latvian civilian population and I must get the record straight, the overwhelming majority of them just couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They were hanging out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and they knew what was going on, and the majority of them couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Yes, there was some exceptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">A few people even risked their lives to help their fellow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But a percentage and it was so minute and so small that it really doesn't amount to anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">After these big exterminations of November and December, life went on in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where just four thousand of us able-bodied men were left, and a few hundred women were kept in a special <span class="BUILDING">house</span> away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Then the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> started arriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The majority of them were sent immediately to their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Some of them were brought to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the in the place of of our people who were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And every day new shipments kept arriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And as time went on, we got to know them, and in the beginning there was a certain understandable resentment from the Latvian Jews because somehow we felt that we had to make room for them, and when when you are emotionally overwhelmed by happenings, you don't think rational and you blame the the new arrivals to to a certain extent about what had transpired. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But soon we became friends with them and even though we were separated by barbed wire, we had contacts with them being that they had also women and girls, and in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was only men. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The contact came, used to be boyfriend-girlfriend relationships and all that, and a certain amount of social life under those primitive circumstances took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My brother and I, who used to in in 1n 1n pre-war times belong to a band, used to come to, on Sundays we used to go the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghetto</span> used to call it, and have social meetings and and sing and and even dance a little bit, just, you know, just to pass the time away, and , you know, life was going on and everybody was trying to do the best he could under the circumstances. (</span><span class="sentence" id="143">pause) A lot of my friends from from pre-war friends volunteered to join the Jewish police force in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The Jewish police force was there for the purpose of keeping order within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They had no weapons of course, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They just keep order, make sure that the sanitation is properly done, that they that they maintain order. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There there's no criminal activities whatsoever, and my first reaction, my brother's and I when they asked for volunteers, we wanted very much to volunteer for that too, because it meant have a uniform, have a little bit larger rations of food, not to have to go to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , be inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and all that, but my father, God bless him, was very much against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He says I don't want you to volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Just do whatever you have do, do your work, and don't be in the forefront and try to keep a low profile. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Little did we know that indirectly that saved our lives later on because as life was 01:25: going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and as our situation started to become hopeless, some people started thinking of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I was not directly involved but I knew about it because I had a cousin in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who was directly involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They were smuggling guns and other military equipment into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , with the sole purpose of whenever it comes to it, that we will not go to the slaughter voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We'll fight back as much as we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">As it happens many times, somehow the Germans got wind of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And till today we still don't know exactly how, but the fact is they came in, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> one day, and they discovered the arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And immediately everybody who was there in that particular <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So were many other ones, and nobody ever saw them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And a week later, they took, they lined up the whole police force of forty-five young, of our youngest and bravest men, most of them were close friends of mine, and the German officer who was in charge of the of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> said to them that they're holding them directly responsible for not maintaining order in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And they took them out to a to a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they machined them all, machine-gunned them all to death, forty-five of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">One of them escaped somehow, but later on they caught him too, so not one of them is alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">One night when I came back from work with my brother, we heard the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And it was devastating, but we first realized that by not letting us join this police force my father had saved our lives at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So life was progressing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">On and off they would come again and take away so many hundreds of people - whoever couldn't work, whoever was elderly, whoever was sick - never to be seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And finally in 1943, the order came out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> will be liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And the ghetto population will be transferred to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They didn't liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> all at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Used to came an order, tomorrow we'll need five hundred men. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Then three days later another two hundred men. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So every time an order came out for so many people, every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and every family had to supply a certain amount of people, and everybody of course wanted to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as long as possible because as bad as things were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald concentration camp</span> is going to be much worse and we had heard already rumors to that effect, so when the order came that that in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so many people have to be volunteered to go my brother and father and I consulted. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">One of us had to go and I felt that I was the younger one. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I was the stronger one. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">My father was out of the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It was between my brother and I.
QUESTION:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  I felt that I would have a better chance to survive in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I I really felt that somehow my brother who is who was not in excellent good health at that time already, would have a more difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And we discussed it and in the beginning of course my brother didn't want to hear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He wanted to to pull straws or things like that, but I said no, it's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So next day, about three hundred of us were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> was a very very difficult <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Was a <span class="DLF">hell hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were ruled by criminals, by German criminals who were also prisoners 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but they were above us. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And they used to beat the hell out of us and food was very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">See every day they used to line up in the morning, at five o'clock in the morning in the cold winter, without any clothing, and used to, they got so many people to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And many of those German war criminals were were murderers. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for murder, and they were in charge of us, so there was one particular guy, we used to call him Mr. X. He used to take a group of hundred, two hundred people out to work every day, and for sport every day used to drown one or two of them, just for the sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Used to bring back less than he took out. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Fortunately it didn't last too long for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I was able to volunteer to a group which was supposed to to go a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , and in about three or four weeks I was able to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> and go to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was about a couple of miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , and there I was working for a unit called TWL, which is in German Truppen Wirtschafts Lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It it was a unit which supplied the clothing and the food for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We were working there in assorting clothing and many other duties as far as the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">A few weeks later I found out that my brother and father also were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had been liquidated, so they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I was working in this TWL and I was doing everything I could to try to get them to join me, because the conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> were horrible and I knew that particularly my father couldn't survive too long there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  What kind of things did you try to get them to join you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Well, there always used to be some contact with with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , and I used to try to get some messages to them to try to volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">The minute they asked for volunteers to come to us, to volunteer to come to our to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Also every couple of weeks they used to take from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> people who had to go to the dentist, problems with their teeth - the dentist was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , and what he would do is when you used to come with a toothache he just would pull your tooth, and when I heard about this I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I said I had a toothache and I volunteered because I wanted to see my brother and my father and see them personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So that morning when I was working in the <span class="BUILDING">clothing depot</span> I took some socks from the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I hid them underneath my pants and at night we were lined up, a kommando of about fifteen, twenty people ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Low and behold we were stopped at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Germans control. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">When I heard that I knew that I'm going to have a lot of difficulties to say the least, and I had to get rid of those (pause) socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I was able to establish contact with a German, not with a German - it was a Latvian guard outside the barbed wire and I told him in Latvian, I have some socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Keep them. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I was able to sneak the socks to him and get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">However when I looked at my group, all of a sudden there were some socks which somebody else had thrown down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and I had told the people who were with us, fellow Jews, that I was carrying some socks for my brother and my father, so the people felt that they were my socks, and when I told them that I got rid of my socks they didn't believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And when the Germans saw the socks laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , they said who, who do they belong to. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">In the beginning I wasn't going to volunteer because I, there was no reason for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They wasn't mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But I was pressured in into admit, to confess by my fellow Jews because they really felt that it was mine and they said if I'm not going to volunteer, everybody was going to be punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I had no choice, and I stepped forward and I said they were mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And next, immediately I was given a merciless beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I was dragged to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> where they used to keep the people before execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I was almost unconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I was thrown into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and I blacked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">A couple of hours later I must have woken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was still completely dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It was night and first I did not realize what had transpired. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Slowly it started coming back to me and I started to realize that I was doomed. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">People were executed for much less than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I just couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I was holding my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I was aching all over, but I just couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I was twenty years old, and I just couldn't believe that this was going to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">All kinds of thoughts started flashing through my mind - the kind of life I was hoping to build one day for myself and it all goes down the <span class="DLF">drain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It's not going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">An hour later I heard footsteps nearing the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> where I was incarcerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I was a hundred percent sure they were Germans coming to execute me. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The <span class="DLF">door</span> swung open and there were two Germans, officers in uniform and the camp elder, the Jew who was the camp elder. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">His name was David Kagan, and as they entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , before the Germans had a chance to draw their guns, the camp Aeltester started beating me, saying you lousy son of a gun, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">How dare you to steal from the Germans, and kicked me and beat me and kicked me and beat me. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I started bleeding profusely from all over my body and he beat me into unconsciousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But somehow, ironically, that saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He beat me so much that the Germans assumed that I was dead or close to dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They just turned around and walked out, which I was told later because I was unconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I was laying in this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> for another two or three days and then finally the camp elder came and got me and took me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it is something which I have never forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Mr.Kagan who did not have a very good reputation from everybody because a lot of people felt that he was too strict and sometimes too merciless, but I must, if I want to be honest I really have to admit that if not for him I wouldn't be alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Another few months passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was 1944 now. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And even though we did not have any radios or any newspapers, the news kept trickling 1n to us that the tide of the war had turned. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The Russians had won the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and the Germans were starting to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And of course for us it meant some kind of a glimmer of hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Perhaps, perhaps the Russians will be liberating us before the Germans have a chance to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">In the meantime, periodically the Germans would come into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> line everybody up in front of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> where one of the Germans would sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Everybody had to undress naked and walk in front of him, and if there was something he would like on your body, any scar or anything like that, you went to the left, and left meant certain death. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And my father who was an invalid and who was with us at that time yet still on many occasions he would have been doomed if he wouldn't have somehow we're able to save him by not letting him go into the <span class="DLF">line</span> , by sneaking him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">When once I remember my father was taken out and and sent to the left, and he was still standing there and waiting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to take him away, and the German guard was walking back and forth, and as he turned his back I snuck in. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I grabbed my father and pulled him out of there which at that time saved his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So my brother and I and my father were still in this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when 19...when the fall of 1944 came, and that was when we started already hearing rumors that the Russians were getting closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And one day we woke up and we heard already the Russian guns and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> and we could, you know, we were starting to to have hope against hope that maybe, maybe salvation is near. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">If I were what is what is it was not meant to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It was not meant to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We were all driven out of our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , lined up with the Germans and taken to the <span class="DLF">port</span> where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferries</span> was standing by, and we chased on to those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferries</span> and taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Stuthoff</span> , and we heard, after we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> , when we heard that we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> , we were devastated because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> was a camp which was very well known as one of the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Was a lot of brutality, a lot of killings and hardly anybody esc...got out got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> , so the three of us, my brother, my father and I, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> and spent several weeks there. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> were beyond any description. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">People were dying left and right from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">People - you woke up in the morning - next to you people were dead, emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And the condition was deteriorating by the day because the tide of the war had turned and as bad as it was before, now the Germans were letting the anger out on the few remaining Jews because they were, it was clear to them by this time they were loosing the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">A few weeks after we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> , we were all lined up one day and a German officer said they are looking for volunteers to work in a German ship building firm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> called Schiff ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Werke. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My brother and I and my father volunteered, but as my father was going across to join us, the German officer noticed that he was invalid. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He was dragging a leg as a result of scarlet fever which he had in his youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">The minute he noticed that he says you cannot go. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Back. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">My brother and I started pleading, it's our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We have to go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Just to spite, he says you're going and he's staying here, and no matter how much we begged and no matter how much we pleaded and cried, it did not help. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We were kicked and beaten and forced to leave my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">It was clear to my brother and myself that the minute my father would be left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> he would be doomed. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And we were we were absolutely heart-broken to leave him there, because we knew it was going to be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But we were forced to do it and that's how we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> we were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burgram</span> ? (</span><span class="sentence" id="278">ph) and from there every morning at 4:30 we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">shipbuilding company</span> to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And that was going on for a couple of months...
QUESTION:  Tell us about the work you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  Well, they were they were building <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> there and we had to carry the heavy steel parts and hand it to the mechanics and to the engineers, whoever wanted them, and we were guarded by German soldiers all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The working conditions left a lot to be desired, but we used to get an extra piece of bread so it was still better than staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Besides while going to work we could always have some communication with the outside world, learn what was happening, find out that the war has definitely turned, that the Germans were retreating on all fronts. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We also learned that <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> had been liberated and we missed it by not more than a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">My brother got sick in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he could not go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He had a had a problem with his stomach and with his legs and he was staying in a <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span> there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I kept trying to look in on him and see that he's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">One day in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> he saw a glass with white liquid and assuming it was milk he drank it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And it was rat poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And that completely destroyed his stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Completely destroyed his stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He was very very sick from from then on. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He was in very very bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And to make things worse a few weeks later the order came we are moving out because the Russians were obviously coming closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That was the winter of 1944-45. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It was a very very - the climate was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We were driven on foot through the <span class="REGION">German countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">My brother could hardly walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I supported him as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It got so bad that he pleaded with me to let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Don't he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Let me die. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I I cannot, I I really cannot handle it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I I want to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Leave me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But it was it was clear that the minute I let him go, he would be shot on the spot because anybody who couldn't keep up with the march was shot on the spot, and you would walk on the <span class="DLF">road</span> - you could see corpses all over because it was an actual death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I just couldn't give in. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I just couldn't drop my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I carried him. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I schlepped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I kept talking to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I'd say we're not too far away from salvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">You can't give up now. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">You can't give up now. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Anyway, somehow I was able to schlep him to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottendorf</span> in <span class="REGION">eastern Pomerania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There the conditions of course got from bad to worse because the Germans didn't have enough to eat themselves anymore because the armies were retreating and the Jews didn't get anything to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">If we got a piece of potato peel we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We used to press it against the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> which you had in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and and roast a potato peel. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Every morning you used to wake up in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> - the fellow on the left, upstairs on the right used to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It was just a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was, you know, it it - another few weeks and there wouldn't be any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And in all that I still was able once in a while when they asked for volunteers to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , come in contact with civilian population in my work, once in a while got a little piece of bread which I could, I would I would be able to bring to my brother who who really didn't get anything to eat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , because he was not in a position to be able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">In the meantime it was 1945, (pause) March. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">March 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">My brother was near death. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">He was very very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They had a little <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> on the side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they sent the very sick people there, and they were just laying there and dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Once in a while I used to come in and bring him something, but what they needed we couldn't give them - medication, any medical help or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Beginning of March I started feeling bad myself and I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Typhoid fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I started, I tried to carry on as long as I could, but I just couldn't do it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And one morning the order came out again we are leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We are marching out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I couldn't march anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I took all my strength to drag myself to the little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> where my brother was laying, and I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I laid next to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">If we're going to die, we're going to die together. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">In the meantime everybody who could walk was lined up and marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We could hear them shooting and we could hear them yelling, but all of a sudden it was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">They were gone, except for two German guards who were left behind with the instructions to shoot the sick fifteen minutes after everybody else leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were so sick at that time, hallucinating - we didn't even know what was going on. (</span><span class="sentence" id="344">Pause) All of a sudden, we could hear shooting, gunfire. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The two German guards ran into our <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> and said to us, we have instructions to shoot you, but we won't if you won't give us away to the Russians, because the Russians are coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They took off their German uniforms, put on our striped prisoner clothes, and laid down right next to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">A few minutes later we could hear 01:54: some more shooting and before you know it, the were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">All of a sudden a young Russian officer wearing a short leather coat and I remember it so well like it happened yesterday, with a machine-gun strung around his waist, walked in, looked at us and a seasoned Army veteran broke out in tears and started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">What have they done to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">He says: "Ikh bin a Yid.” </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And he says we will take revenge for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">For every one of you, we will get thousands of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And somebody pointed out the two German guards who were laying next to us and they took them away immediately, and that was our liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">That's how we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Yes, we had freedom, but many didn't survive the freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">There was no medical help. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Yes, there was some more food but our stomachs could not handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Many people died because of over-eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The Russians couldn't be bothered with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They had a war to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So all they told us is you stop the German refugees who are on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and you make them take you back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Needless to say, the minute the Russians were gone the Germans couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They left us laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Finally a Russian stopped the German horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and he said to them, you take them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and if you don't we'll shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So finally this German family or whoever they were took my brother and myself and another two guys, put them on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , took us back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauenburg</span> , which was also in <span class="REGION">eastern Pomerania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was in the center of fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">There was a lot of shooting, a lot of bombing from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The the Germans dropped us off in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> - just dropped us and took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We were staying in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We could not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">01:57: We didn't know what to do, how, what, so we was crawling on our legs and hands, hands and legs until we came to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">In the meantime it had gotten dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">All we could do was feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We didn't know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">We opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , crawled in, found some kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and laid down there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  We've got to change tapes, and this is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">We're just going to change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We're back. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">You've collapsed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Several hours later we smelled smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The Russians were burning the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> down and as sick as we were and as tired as we were, we had to crawl out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> again and look for other <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Finally we found a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we collapsed there and then the long tedious process of recovery started to take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Took us months. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">As a matter of fact I recouped a little faster and...
QUESTION:  Tell me - just a minute though. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">What was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Tell me something about where you were and what they moment was like as the Russians came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  Well, we were, as I said we were in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">eastern Pomerania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The Russians were occupied with their march. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They were going straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> they were telling us. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So we had very little possibility to have any kind of a real contact with the Russians because they were only coming through. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They were only coming through. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">All day long troops, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were coming through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But they left a certain amount of people behind for the running of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and administration and all that and once I was able to get around again, the Russians did help us to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">My brother was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We lived with two, we stayed in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with two other friends of ours who were also liberated and one of my friends and myself, we were able to get around better so we used to go around. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It it was a very unusual situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We, at that time we really were not concerned about our new life, about thinking about the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">All we were concerned was getting enough food to eat and getting well again. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We did not think about plans, where we going to go, whether we're going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> or 02:03: whether not going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We really didn't give 1t much thought because all those years of of this incarceration and living under certain circumstances , you know, you you don't think the way a normal human being would think - that I have to start making plans about my future. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">All we're thinking in terms of just survival, day to day survival, and it took a considerable amount of time simply emotionally we were ready to start thinking about other things than just the day of survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  How did you feel at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  Well, of course we were very anxious to find out what happened to the rest of our families, whether there was still anybody alive, try to establish some kind of a contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">But our primary purpose was to really get back on our feet so we could function again. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">In addition, the Russians were taking any, every able-bodied person was taken into the army, and they couldn't care less whether you were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Then they used to put you 1n a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , give you some care. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">The minute you could well enough they used to give you a uniform and a gun and away you went. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Many people who were liberated at that time had to go to the Russian army and still in the last few months were killed on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , after surviving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for over four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I slowly was starting to get a little better and we made contact with some Russian officers who were coming through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they asked us whether we would like to work for them as interpreters, being that my brother and I speak fluently Russian and German, they asked us to to come with them to help them to deal with the with the civilian 02:05: German population. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And we accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We felt that if if even if it was temporary, it was...we did not feel like going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> right away for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Was it you know, because we had emotional apprehensions about going back, what we were to find, but we just felt that in the meantime if we worked there, we'll be provided for and they'll take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So we started working for them, and four or five months passed by and we were doing quite well...
QUESTION:  What were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Mostly interpreting between - you see, the Russians were running big <span class="DLF">German farms</span> to get the food to the troops and the Germans were working for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And the communication, we used to help to communicate between the Germans and the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And we also - I was in charge of a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I was managing a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">My brother did something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So we we had a pretty good job with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">For for for a while they didn't bother us, you know, they pretty good to us, but four or five months later, maybe even less than four or five months, in the middle of the night, they arrested us, my brother and I. And we were not told why we are being arrested because under the communist system you are assumed guilty unless you're proven otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">In other words it's an opposite like it 1s in our system. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So they don't give you any explanation when they 02:07: arrest you. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Just took us away, put us 1n <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and later we found out that the reason we were arrested there was one Russian officer, a lieutenant, who was anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">He went back to the general and says the only reason the two Jews survived is because they were Nazi collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Now as I said, they don't investigate whether it's true or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They don't give you a chance to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Didn't give us a chance to prove that it's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They just arrested us. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Put us in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , with the most undesirable element, Russian element who fought in the well-known Vlasov army. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was army of Russian volunteers who fought against their own brothers, and we were sitting with those criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It just, 1t was it was hard to believe for us that after surviving over four years of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> , we would have to deal with that and truthfully speaking it wasn't much better than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">We were kept under most inhuman conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">My brother and I were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I was thrown in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , in a Stall [stable] without <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I got boils all over my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I really felt that it was our end after all this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It the situation looked hopeless. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But somehow we were fortunate again in the respect that it was a Jewish major in the Russian army and his name was Auslaender and one day they called us to interrogate us and we told him that we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and what they are accusing us, we have we have hundreds and hundreds of witnesses who were with us to dispel any doubts and all we're interested is to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , on to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Somehow he felt pity and he let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Yes, it took some other doings to persuade him but our our our wives - we were married at that time already - yes, my wife was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">She was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we had lost track of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">After the war, while I was working for the Russians, I was able to find her somewheres wandering around in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I brought her to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Her and her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And my brother had met a girl, Jewish girl, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">At that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span> , today it's <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he also got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So they knew, the the the girls knew where we were incarcerated and were able to follow us, and somehow they were able to establish contact and also it took a little bribery to get us out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">In addition, you know, to this major who felt pity on us, took a little certain amount of bribery. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">They let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They didn't give us any papers but they let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">At that time my brother and I made up our mind that we're not going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We aren't going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> after this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We didn't want any part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We didn't want any part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Said we're going to try to make it to to the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So that was very very complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And first we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and there we were able to establish contacts with some Russian soldiers who smuggled us over the <span class="DLF">border</span> also for bribes, smuggled us over the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I was I went with a special kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> which delivered mail from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and the Russian soldiers made a business out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They hid people underneath the sacks of mail, and that's where I was laying and all the sacks of mail on top of me and that's the way I went over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">My brother and the three ladies were smuggled in a different open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with a Russian captain who was able to get them through and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we all met. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We my sister-in-law was a native of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> from before the war and she was able to get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It was 1946 and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for a little while, a few months, and then I applied for a visa through the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society [HIAS] and 1947, March 10th, 1947, I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">My brother stayed another six months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He came six months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Of course when we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> it wasn't easy, but I never took the attitude that anybody owes me something like some other people had, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And I was content to be here and have an opportunity to try to rebuild my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We worked hard, two jobs, three jobs - whatever was necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">My wife worked hard and slowly we kept rebuilding our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Family - my first son was born in 1950, and my second son, 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">My oldest son Stewart is 39 years old today. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">My youngest son Charles is 37. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I have since been divorced, after 29 years of marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I have remarried eight years ago to a wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">My brother has had much much of tragedy even after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">His first wife who was also a survivor, died in 1952 or '53 from a heart ailment and left him with a four year old son. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He remarried a year later and was married to another woman for twenty-five years and she died from cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Now my brother has remarried again. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He's married now for almost eight years to a very nice, charming woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">A few years back, quite a few years back, my dear friend Mr. Max Kaufmann who was the mainstay of Latvian Jews in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , Mr. Max Kaufmann wrote a book about the destruction of Latvian Jewry about five years after the liberation and this book has been served, served as reference to many historians and many people who wrote books after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He was a very close friend of my father and I felt almost like I would be his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He used to always try to keep the remnants of the Latvian Jewry in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> together by arranging yearly memorials during December for the twenty-seven thousand Jews who were murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And he asked me to get involved, to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So maybe twenty years ago I got involved in that and I assisted him all through those years to go on with his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Max Kaufmann died about five years ago, and I felt that it was most imperative for me to try to carry on with the work which he so bravely carried on for many years by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I called a few of my friends together from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and we formed an organization called Jewish Survivors of Latvia. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We try to pass on the legacy of the once beautiful Latvian Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> to our children and children's children. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">We also incorporate in our organization the new immigrants from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> who arrived who arrived in the last fifteen years and are still arriving today. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I am involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">A lot of work which has to do with keeping the flame alive, perpetuating the heritage, trying to tell the world what was done to us and never let it forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I personally feel very very strongly when people ask me how come that so many died and and you didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Usually I feel, I answer is first of all it was a certain amount of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You had to have luck because no matter what you did, nobody can resist a bullet, but I also felt that a lot had to do with the fact that I was young and strong and also most important I felt that it was meant to be and I maybe I had a mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Because I was fortunate enough to survive, I have a responsibility and mission to do my very best to try to tell the world what was done to us and what man's inhumanity can do, where hate and bigotry can lead to. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">When we start looking around us today, we are witnessing the awakening of anti-Semitism, of national anti-Semitism in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> to a point where the million six hundred thousand Jews in the Soviet Union, they do not feel safe anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It's not anymore a question of looking for a better life. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It's a question of being frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I have 02:20: so people who I have met in the few months from Soviet Union and some as recently as last week from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , there's hardly anybody today who does not consider getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We are unfortunately anti-Semitism as a result of the liberalization of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , nationalism and with it anti-Semitism is rearing its ugly head again. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And therefore I feel it's twice as important now not to leave one stone unturned to make the world aware of what is happening and to try and do everything possible not to let the same mistake to happen again, where the whole world stood by indifferently and watched our people being slaughtered. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I feel as long as I possibly can I would love to go on with this important work whether it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , whether it's in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , whether it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> or in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Wherever I have a chance and opportunity to get involved I'm sure going to try.</span></p>
