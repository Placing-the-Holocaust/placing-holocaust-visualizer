<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Michael V. Vogel. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">V-O-G-E-L. I was born November 29th, 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacovce</span> , J- A- C-O- V -C-E, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me about your childhood, about your growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">What was it like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  I come from a family, my parents, my father was a businessman, he was a cattle dealer, in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacovce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacovce</span> until I became six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I had an older sister and a younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We then moved to a larger community which is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topol any</span> , T-O-P-O-L-C-A-N- Y.C with a umlaut [ha ek]. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And the reason for the move, because of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father wanted to put us into a larger <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topol</span> any. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topol</span> any, we started, uh, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , and soon after, two more children were born in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I can give you their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My name used to be Moshe, which was, uh...they used to call me M - I - S - O, S with an umlat [Miso with a ha_ek]. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My sister who was older than my, uh, than I am, was name was Rose, Ro_1--R -O- Z with an umlaut [ha_ek]- I. My younger brother, who was not quite two years younger than me, his name was Arpad, A - R - P- A- D; and I had a sister Marta, M- A-R-T- A; anda little brother, the baby brother, whose name was Maxmilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We lived a fairly happy life in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Well, it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> --this was the region of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but our part was called Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We were the Slovaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Antisemitism was there, always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I remember when we used to play soccer as kids, there was never boys against boys, it was always the Catholic against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That was the kind of soccer games we used to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But we got along as well as one could get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We stuck to our ways and they stuck to theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh, we were quite religious, especially our mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I even remember my bar mitzvah in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh, my grandparents on my mother's side, my mother by the way came from another community, uh I would say sixty, seventy kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topol</span> any. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Her maiden name was Feldman, and our grandparents, her parents, were there at my bar mitzvah, which we called the <span class="BUILDING">grosse shul</span> --the big <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , the big <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Our rabbi was a very famous guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">His name was Abraham Weiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , every morning and especially before I became bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And then of course after that, every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We all went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , except my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My sister was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Now she was a pre-teener, pre-teenager, where my father's youngest sister lived; and she stayed with her a couple of years to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh, I would say from '35 to '37. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And then she was sent back when Hitler started the rumbles. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">This was before the Anschluss in 1938 in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We knew of problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We knew of some problems but no one...no one paid much attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Everyone felt ah nothing's going to happen to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But we found out later that it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Because in 1938 when Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> so to speak as part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he started to take the Jews on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We heard on the radios, those of us who had radios, what was going on - the beatings of the Jews, the break-in of the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and that type of hooliganism that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And pretty soon we found the Austrian Jews were running away from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my mother took an Austrian lady in to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We didn't have a huge <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but the five children but we gave her a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But most of all I remember is when the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> mobilized its armed forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And the reason for the mobilization was because Hitler wanted to take part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> which known to us as Sudetenland into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He wanted to annex <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">That was a Germanic-speaking part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I remember my father was also taken into service, and I still remember the narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> as the five children and our mother walked with our father to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to wish him well, to say goodbye to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And, of course, the famous Neville Chamberlain quote, "peace in our time." </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And peace in our time never came; because as soon as he [Chamberlain] probably closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> of 10 Downing Street, Hitler marched not only into Sudetenland but he took over the Czechs, Bohemians, Moravians. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , the <span class="REGION">region</span> where I was born, didn't, never seen a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Nazi soldiers never marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So what happened with us, the Hlinka Guard, Guard, Hlinka, which H - L-I- N-K - A, was formed, and then in March 15, 1939, is when <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> became the puppet government of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The Hlinka Guards, these were people that were our neighbors, people that our parents did business with, that grew up, and lived with practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They became the Guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  O.K., the Guards did what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Guards? </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Their function was, this was the Nazi-type, almost like an SS-type guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So what happened with the Jews in particular, of course, only to the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> as a matter of fact, all Jews from the age of six had to wear a yellow Star of David, sewn on the left breast of their outer clothing, with the inscription, Jude, Jew in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I remember we couldn't, couldn't walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">No more than three or four Jews could walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And, of course, curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">By eight o'clock all of us had to be in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We couldn't shop, uh, uh, any time we wanted to, only designated hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And since my father was, uh, a cattle dealer and horse dealer, while my father was, uh, gone, I became, I was the oldest boy, my sister was older than me of course, so I was sort of in charge of knowing some of the millers, some of the flour millers, and go to pick up flour for our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And you couldn't do it during the day because if you got caught, the Hlinkas would get to you and of course you were punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Midnights, uh, middle of the nights, was when my mother and I and a couple of other Jewish ladies would go, go to the <span class="BUILDING">miller</span> and pick up flour so we could have bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And it was all <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , and you always paid through the nose. (</span><span class="sentence" id="74">Laughter) Everyday there was a new law read to us or posted on, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin boards</span> - they had these little round, uh, <span class="BUILDING">stalls</span> where you would come and read the bulletin what happens next to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh, we were harassed, beaten on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and of course the businesses were taken away from all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My father business, my father's business was given to the person who worked for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And my father had to work there to show him how to do the business, to sell the cattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And my father never believed that anything would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Almost to the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He said no, he - the reason for that was because most, most of these people, first of all, we were Slovaks, Czechs, we were born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">No one's going to bother us. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And second, my father also dealt with the Czechoslovakian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He sold cattle and horses to the government for, for the armies and that, uh, type of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So he said no, nothing's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">This will, ah, this will pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Because we were harassed, we were beaten, and in early 1942, end of 1941, early 1942, we heard that they are going to put us into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">There was a rumor at one time, too--which was not even a rumor. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Actually it was the truth, that the Jews will be shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Uh, I was a kid, I never knew, I was a small young teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But it didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Instead of <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> , myself, my older sister, and my next brother--Rose, myself and Arpad--were told to report to the <span class="DLF">Town Square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">All young Jewish boys and girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">When they rounded us up, they told us that we're going back to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're going to be relocated and your parents will join you. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They took us about two hours from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitlager</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp was</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky,</span> N -O- V - A- K - Y, manned by large group of SS, of, uh, Slovakian Hlinka Guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Mind you, we have yet to see an SS officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Let me, let me re-track back for a moment if I may. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Uh, the first time that have seen German soldiers was when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was invading <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , September Ist, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And how we seen them, the German army was going through <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because we were first and then came <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But we felt them. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My father had to take the cattle from his <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> , from his, and the horses, and deliver it to the <span class="DLF">Town Square</span> for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Beaten by these, uh, by the Hlinka Guards behind him, going fast, to give this for the Germans to take with them as, as food and and horses for, for carrying their materials, war materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That was the first time that I'd seen a German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And when we'd seen them on those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> with the side little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and, and, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and horses pulling their, their - that's how we've seen - that's the first time we've seen the Nazi soldiers, the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">This was the Wehrmacht at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, we never had anything to do with them as far as being our guards yet, because our guards were the people that spoke Slovak just like we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And when we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> , they loaded us on to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> after we loaded, after we packed our belongings at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They came with us to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> so we wouldn't run, we wouldn't hide, and they had enough of these guards all over, all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Did you know any of your guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely, by names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Tell me about your conversation with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Well, they would come, first of all they became ruthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">O.K. The word "_ id" was common. "</span><span class="sentence" id="116">id" is a Jew. "</span><span class="sentence" id="117">We finally got you _ids," and that type of words, and beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They all had clubs and rifles and canes. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Whatever they had they would beat you. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">These were people, this one guy in particular, his name was Martin ek (ph), who was the barber, who was our barber. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">barbershop</span> - he worked for a Jewish barber called Dezider (ph) ' The Jews were never deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Banau, B - A - N - A - U. The poor guy perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And this Martin ek (ph) was my barber. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He cut my hair, cut my family's hair, and he, you couldn't ask for a nicer guy during the time (laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He was also an alcoholic but most of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And when we arrived to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we seen guards from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You would go close to him and would ask him nicely, you know, please don't help or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Boom, the first thing would happen you would get hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">When they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , by, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> , and when we arrived there it was a huge complex. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">With wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Girls on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , boys on the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And we were assigned to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , unloaded our belongings, and then we had to line up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and then the guards would read us the laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And, by the way, food at the time was still plentiful in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134"><span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was a farm country, so the food was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The cooks were our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The Jews became, those who were appointed to be the cooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We had meat, we had, we had potatoes, we had eggs, we, we still that. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we were also allowed at the time still to be receiving packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So the parents would send some stuff to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So that was still allowed because it was our, you know, still in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">When the next morning when they woke us up and lined us up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they told us after breakfast, you're going to report to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">What kind of work? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Something which really, uh, none, nothing, uh, useful, just carrying bricks or stones and making piles. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Because they didn't build anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There was nothing to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , just a big <span class="DLF">grounds</span> with <span class="DLF">holes</span> where they were digging, some people were digging sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My job, I was assigned to carrying stones in my bare hands and making a pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And after we made that pile high, then we take that pile and make another pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And this was the daily, daily routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was some people, there was even <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> with small, small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that ran on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , that we pushed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And we would just carry sand, dump it and carry more sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">No reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">There weren't <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> built. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">There weren't <span class="DLF">roads</span> built. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">detention camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Yea, we still had music and our singing groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">None of us believed what, what was waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">When in April 1942 the first transport, well actually it was the end of March, the first transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> was taken and my brother Arpad was there and so was my sister Ro _1, Rose. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Of course, I didn't know, we didn't know where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Neither did they. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I found out of course much later, my sister Rose ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">My brother Arpad ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin-Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Couple of months later my turn came. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I, I left with a bunch of people, Slovakian people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> also, and we, this is what they told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">This is how they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They lined us up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They told us we're going to be relocated to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Pack whatever you owned, report back in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They loaded us into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and I will never forget, just as, just as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> started to move, in unison we all started to sing the Hatikvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I'll never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Just the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> moving, and we singing the Hatikvah anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And when we finished the Hatikvah, still being Czechs and Slovaks, we sang the Czech national anthem. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">When we came, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> stopped at a <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177"><span class="DLF">Railroad siding</span> is for the, load, uh, freight. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We've seen, oh, I would say about twenty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> lined up, on the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , and each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> had a wooden plank, <span class="DLF">doors</span> wide open, and the plank leading into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They loaded us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , between eighty and hundred of us, boys and girls together. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">A metal bucket was put on each end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which was used for <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> 's <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked and sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We could hear them locking it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">This was the last time that we have seen the Slovakian Hlinka guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Some of the boys got friendlier with the guards, and they say, "Goodbye to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">You know, this 1s it, we won't [see] you no more." </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> is approximately 24 hours distance from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Of course, we didn't know we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They told us we were being relocated and our families will join you. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Your families will soon join you. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I would say approximately 24 hours later. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Tell me, before you go on, tell me about those 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> - first of all, it was jam packed, uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">People were fighting for <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">You could not, not all of us could sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Hardly anyone could lay down. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">People were crushing each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And of course they were fighting for the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom facilities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">That was the worst part. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Those people who couldn't hold, and then of course the buckets would be over-filled, and there was nothing else you could do, just relieve yourself as close to the comer of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> as you possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We stopped once, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , just the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> stopped once to relieve the buckets and they gave us some water, one, on one trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I don't remember where - I was told it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jinna</span> , that was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but who could tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And we got the buckets out and then they gave us some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I would say next morning, now I would say next morning we arrived to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> were opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And this was the first time that we have seen SS guards, SS soldiers, and SS officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And every SS guard had a dog on a leash, either a German Shepherd or a Doberman Pincher. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Mostly German Shepherds. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Their rifles with bayonets sticking up, and either wooden walking cane, a bamboo cane or a whip in their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And of course, most of us, all of us in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> I should say, spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">If you were Czechoslovakian, you spoke German, Hungarian and Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">That was our language. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">These were our languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And they yelled, the Nazis would yell, "Juden raus schnell!"-- "All Jews out fast, fast!" </span><span class="sentence" id="215">With a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And we have seen, among the SS, people in striped uniforms, prisoner striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And these were the boys that worked the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Of course we didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The Nazis, the SS would tell us to line up. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And the boys, the prisoner boys, the people in prison uniform, would come to us and tell us either in German or in Czech or whatever language, line yourself up in rows of five. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Of course, all done with beatings by the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">When they separated the boys from the girls, when we were all lined up in rows of five, everything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi concentration camp</span> was five, because of easier count, and with the Nazis, with the dogs on the side of us, we started to march. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I would say a mile and a half maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And we came to a <span class="DLF">gate</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">A <span class="DLF">gate</span> with a half moon sign, that says "Arbeit Macht Frei," work makes you free, or gives you freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">After we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I'm going to jump a little bit 1f I may, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for what, three, four months, and we used to march through this <span class="DLF">gate</span> , in and out of this <span class="DLF">gate</span> , with the orchestra playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">As we marched through this <span class="DLF">gate</span> , we used to say among each other, "Arbeit Macht Frei, <span class="BUILDING">Krematorium</span> drei"--"Work makes you free when you end up in <span class="BUILDING">crematorium three</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And those of us we always looked who survived, who's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">As we marched through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , the girls on one side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the boys on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="230"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is built of solid brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">It's, everything is brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Even the <span class="DLF">road</span> , the <span class="DLF">streets</span> are made of brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , solid <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Before the Nazis invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , this part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> used to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish Army camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So they marched us through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> with whips and beatings and dogs jumping at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We came to a huge <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They shoved us into the huge <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> , and there were prisoners and SS telling us what to do next. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">There was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The first <span class="REGION">area</span> we had to undress, strip our clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">There were hooks behind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">You put the clothing through a piece of wire, hang the clothing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Take our shoes off, put the shoes on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> were the barbers, the camp barbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Where they shaved our head, cut our hair, shaved the entire body. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They said this for hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Then we moved to another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> where the tattooing was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So the tatoo was done on left forearm. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">There was one person who rubbed the little piece of dirty alcohol on your arm, and the other one had the needle with the inkwell, and he would do the numbering. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So my number is 65,316. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">That means there were 65,315 people numbered before me, tattooed before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">After the tattoo, tattooing was done, they put us, they gave us the clothing, but not what we came with. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">They gave us, issued us a striped brown cap, a jacket, a striped jacket, a pair of striped trousers, a pair of wooden clogs, and a shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">No socks or underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Then the last <span class="REGION">area</span> , when they gave us the uniform, they gave us two strips of cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">The cloth I would say was about six inches long, maybe inch and a half wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And it would star, starred with the Star of David, corresponding with the number on your left forearm, sewn on your left breast and on the right pant leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And then the last 1tem which was the most important item that we received was a round bowl. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And this bowl was the life blood of your being. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">First of all, without 1t you couldn't get the meager rations that we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And second, the bathroom facilities were almost non-existent. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Uh, uh, even at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> on the bottom had a <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But you couldn't use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It was only for the privileged. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">You could use it special times if you were quick, because they only gave you like two, three minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But most of us couldn't use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So, when they gave us the numbers and the bowl, you are now, we were recorded, also by prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">This was the, what they call today the Nazi documentation department. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">These were, they were the officers that did all the paper work. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And these were prisoners that worked in the Nazi documentation department. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Every transport, how many people arrived, and what their names, where they came from, where was the transport from, where it originated, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">These people were the ones to do that type of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And most of these people were actually office workers from <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> - bankers, uh, people that worked as accountants possibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So after they documented all that, we no longer had names. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The Nazis called us Haftlings, prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I became Haftling , prisoner 65,316. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Then they marched us to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as well as all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , all <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where prisoners, Haftlings, were housed, were known as blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I was assigned to <span class="BUILDING">Block 16</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , our main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , each <span class="DLF">block</span> , had between three to five people that were in charge of the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , and their name, their, their ranks and names would be such. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The head guy was called Blockaltester, block elder. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Next to him would be a guy called Stubendienst; "Stube" means <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , "Dienst," "assistant." </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He was the assistant of the Blockaltester and the third guy was the most important guy actually he was the Schreiber or the register and the reason for which he was so important because he would write people he had in each <span class="DLF">block</span> , and how much artificial tea or artificial coffee was served, how many slices of bread, and how much potato peel, potato soup was served in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That guy was the one responsible for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And everything was done by number. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">One of the most cruelest things in any camp was called the Appell, the roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">The roll call in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I will, uh, so many people got killed during roll call, murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Many people ran to the wires just, just before roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Of course even that the Nazis didn't let you do, run to the electric wires and fry. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But that was the most cruelest thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I, I, that was so bad, they would wake you up with beatings anywhere between four and six o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It depended on how early they got up. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And then, you had to line up in rows of five. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was counted with the main prisoner, who was called the Lageraltester, the Lager elder, who in most cases was either a, a German criminal or came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I also want to make one thing very strong, very clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The people in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in most cases, and I would say 90% or better, were Germans or Poles, Germans or Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">These were the ones with the green triangles - then the green triangles were, were the criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The red ones were the political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And we had some red ones also in charge of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But these people had better way, better living, better uniforms, underwear, regular boots or shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They had little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Blockaltester had his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Stubedeinst and Schreiber had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they had food which was organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">These were the murderers, the murderers among us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They were prisoners, but these are the killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And during roll call they would kill many of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Kill us for the simple reason that someone did it in their pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They, uh, soiled their pants, soiled their uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Poor guy couldn't hold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Dysentery was, was something very, very common. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">After two weeks of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> your eyes would swell up from water. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Your, your whole face would be blown up from water. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Your legs would puff on you because of malnutrition and hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And then you became a skeleton which was called Muselmann by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">After the roll call, and only after the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was counted and the count was correct, only then we were able to go to the labor, slave labor work sites we were assigned to, labor Kommandos they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Every group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as well as all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> was called Kommandos. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I was assigned, well, let me give you the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There were four people in each tier. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">There were three tiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Two men to a blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , no nothing, just one little blanket for two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">You never dared to take your uniform or shoes off, clogs off, because if you did the next morning you couldn't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Because during working hours when we were working, many of us lost our clogs in the mud and there, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">No shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">You died sooner anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So after the roll call they gave us our first ration of the day which consisted of artificial tea, artificial coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The Nazis called it Ersatz tea, <span class="BUILDING">Ersatz cafe</span> , Ersatz's tea, <span class="BUILDING">Ersatz's cafe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Then your Kapo Kommando, Kapo who was in charge of the Kommando, you would have to report to him to be assigned to slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">My first job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">munition factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We did, uh, artificial tires, rubber, uh, synthetic tires. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">There were two main <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">One was the <span class="BUILDING">Krupp Werke</span> and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Krupp is well today in American because they sell the coffee makers here. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I see every time I walk by the <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> coffee makers I just cringe. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> , I survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> I would say almost three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  Describe the work please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  O.K. The Buna work, there were a lot of civilian workers which the Nazis brought from different <span class="REGION">European countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The masters, the foremen, uh, the engineers. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I want to make this very strong that a prisoner could not converse with these civilian workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We could not talk with them, although some of us snuck through and tried to, uh, they would throw us sometimes a piece of bread if they weren't afraid, because these, these people too, they had an arm band and the arm band would identify them as civilian workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">See. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They knew what was going on, but, but they couldn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">A lot, there were some from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , those Yugoslavs, there were Poles, the Polish civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">There were some people from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">These were the people that were building, that that did the work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Actually these were the masters, we were the laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They would tell the SS how many people they need and what they want us to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And it was hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Most of the time you didn't work with tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Everything was done with hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">There was a break for lunch right around noon. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The factory whistle would blow and you'd go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And prisoners with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> would bring our noon meal which consisted of the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The soup had mostly potato peels -

<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  They were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The Nazis would take them behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> after we unloaded the people and slowly torture and murder them. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We carried a poor, a poor, poor soul back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Nothing stopped the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">In many cases, an SS man depended where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="426"><span class="REGION">Western European countries</span> for instance which people came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Well dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">When they came, an SS officer would get over a bull horn, and he would tell, ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize that you've been a little inconvenienced, but you know this is a war on, and we don't have the facilities for to better <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , but you will be soon taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> and if you work you will live. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Just leave your belongings behind, and everything will be brought to you after you are cleaned, disinfected. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">You will get hot tea and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And of course we couldn't do anything about that type of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Although many of us tried, tried by telling them, don't take, to a mother we'd tell, don't take a child with you because if you do, you're not going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Excuse me.

QUESTION:  Take us back, you were starting to describe the <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Can you do that please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The Canada Kommando, after we unloaded the people, after the Nazis made sure that we go to the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , and that we don't speak to no one, the main job was to tell the people and try to keep them calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And when, the first thing that would happen after the people were unloaded, in those days there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dump trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The first people they would get rid of were women with children, the old, the sickly, the ill, uh, the people with, uh, cripples. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">These people would be loaded on to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and taken away right away, and the last people that the Nazis would march were the people that were selected to go to slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">With the belongings, some of it on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , but most of it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And when these people were taken, men to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> , women to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> , and the same process was dealt with them as it was done with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Numbered and shaved and showered and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Assigned to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Only then we started to work on the mountains of luggage which was loaded in to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and it went to the <span class="BUILDING">Canada warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">It was a huge complex where girl Canada Kommandos, mostly Slovakian girl Canada Kommando, worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And their job, they were, they were the only ones dressed up almost like, not a civilian but nice, a dress, and they all had babushkas [NB: kerchiefs] tied on their heads, because their heads were shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And these girls worked with the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Disinfecting of the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And when we, we, first we would do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Load it into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Unload it into <span class="BUILDING">Canada warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And there were boxes in front of us, SS guards walking back and forth watching us, what we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And we would take first the valuables would we put into boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Monies in one <span class="REGION">area</span> , gold and watches and rings and that type of stuff in another box. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And everything had its <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Then we started to work with the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Of course, we search the clothing - search the pockets, the shoulders, the shoulder pads were, were, were felt for any, any hard stuff or any soft clothing, or soft monies, and then we had to rip some of it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Even shoe heels were opened, because the Nazis found out that the shoe heels the people saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And toothpaste, in those days because the toothpaste in Europe was not the greatest, not like <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and they would squeeze and look for diamonds and gold, which was found there. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Then we started to work with the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Separate the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Men's, women's and children's clothing separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">There was a blanket on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> always where we dumped the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">After the blanket was full enough, you bundle, you put on your shoulder and took it to the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Now, let me make a very strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">When these bundles of clothing were taken to the girls, many of us brought food to the girls, in the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But, there was always an SS man standing by, he was watching of course the girls too. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But the girls, he couldn't watch the girls doing that, because the girls wanted to, working with the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They were watching what, as we were dumping, if there was any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They knew we were bringing food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">In a way they let us, we played a cat and mouse game with these guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">If they caught you, you got beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Twenty-five on your behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">You bend down and then you get twenty-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You had to count them, twenty-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And you count twenty-five on your buttocks, and the Nazis stop you. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">They say, how many did I give you. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And you say, seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">All over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">This was a sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They called it sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And that's how we used to bring the food to the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And, information to the girls from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="513">She had a brother there, or a father there, not working in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> Kommando but working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marashar</span> (ph) which was uh, uh, people that work with the bricks and, and, and, mortar, that type of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And they would say, your father told me to say this and that, they could keep up and so on, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And then they would write, they would find pencils. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  How, how did they find pencils?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  From us. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">From <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We had the pencils, the papers, the watches, the clocks, the compasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We, we, people from Europe, from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , they used to bring stuff with them that you wouldn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And of course everyone brought the finest finery they had because they felt they can sell it to save their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">That was another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They even told them, some of them, bring, bring, because winters, you need, a lot of them came with nice fur coats and, you know, it was all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And so, I mean, I mean, so we would bring these girls and the girl would send a note to their father or their brother or their cousin or their husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">There was one boy who died last year, his name was Fisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">His wife was working in Canada Kommando, in women's Canada Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He worked in the men's Canada Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So that's how these boys, that's how that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And I, I worked there, the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Then I was put on the night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You know, you see, you couldn't survive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> by yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">You had to have a partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">In Yiddish it was called, in Hebrew it was called shitif (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Shitif (ph) is a partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I had three partners. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Not one of them 1s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The last one was Fisher, who died uh last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And without a partner you couldn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">After we finished a day's work at Canada Kommando, you just couldn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , without being searched, first at the <span class="DLF">work site</span> - lined up, stripped naked in most cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And if you weren't stripped naked, your pants dropped because they knew that some of us carried money in the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that is, uh, kind of dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Uh, but we do, we also knew how to smuggle out, smuggle the stuff in. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">For instance, you in this row, and your friend is in the row in front of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">You always stood behind your friend, behind your partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And as you partner was already searched, you shoved it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And he stepped forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And then you were clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">A lot of times we got caught, beaten and caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Let me give you one incident what would happen to the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">After the girls cleaned the clothing, it was bundled again, and carried by us, there was at the <span class="BUILDING">Canada warehouse</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> , <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And this was taken by us, loaded into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> , and shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I remember one incident very, very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I don't know, I don't know if names, German officers' names mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Uh, there was one guy named Otto Graff (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="554">There was another guy named Unterscharftthrer Wiglet (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="555">That's a rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">Canada warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And a young boy from <span

and stacked the bundles, and the other ones like us, we would carry the bundles. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He would fill the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">This boy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> hid himself with the bundles and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> took off. </span><span

Mietek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">He was a murderer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">He was a Polish, uh, uh, murderer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">He was our Blockaltester, and he, he pride himself that he could kill one person with a blow to the proper <span class="REGION">area</span> in his neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So he could kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And this poor, poor Jewish prisoner, Jewish boy got murdered with one blow and taken away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was standing still, holding for Heinrich Himmler to come and inspect the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I, I, in my time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , Himmler came twice to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but I will never forget with this happening in my <span class="DLF">block</span> , this, this murder in front of my <span class="DLF">block</span> when Mietek, Mietek murdered him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And there were number, there were more than one person like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">There was one other, a German prisoner they used to call Monkey Tin (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">He was another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Mietek and Monkey Tin would have a bet who can kill more people with one blow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And that's...this was Himmler's visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">That's how they cleaned up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">First, they got rid of all the people that didn't look well enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were swept, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were cleaned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Of course, Himmler never went into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">The only thing, he came is just march with the Lageraltester whose name was Rudolph Hoess by the way.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And this commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , Mr. Rudolph Hoess, would walk with Heinrich Himmler and other lieutenants, their... their lieutenants, and just go from <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> on the * Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Yes ma'am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">QUESTION:  We would also be talking about Mengele and could you tell us about your meetings with Mengele? </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I gather you did so often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">ANSWER:  Yes, well, Mengele arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , not to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in May 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I still remember when, uh, there too a big fuss was made about the doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">The doctors were the ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Because 1n all the Krankenbaus, all the, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sick bays</span> , where ever they put prisoners, there never doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">The only reason doctors came there is to make a selection in who was no longer was fit to be kept alive or selected to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And they had a holding, they was a 7, 11 block in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Block 7 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And this 1s the <span class="DLF">block</span> that they would take prisoners that were already on their way, on the to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And they would hold them there until they had enough, and then they would just walk them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to, to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorias</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So, but mostly I remember Mengele, first about the Mengele selections in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Of course, we didn't know when the selection would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">But all of a sudden, in most cases on a Sundays, cause everyone was in, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was taken out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appellplatz</span> , to roll call place, lined up in rows of five, stripped naked, and your clothing was dropped by you in front of your feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And Mengele, with the, with the Lager... Lageraltester, who was a prisoner, and the Lagerfuhrer, and also the commandant; they would go from <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , block to <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And behind Mengele was a prisoner registrar--a Schreiber what they called--and as Mengele would, this is how, how it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">You in a row of five, always in rows of five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">The first five, step forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Mengele would walk in front and in back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">As he walked this way, left or right, left or right, and those who picked up their clothing were still staying alive, because, we didn't know, we found out later how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">First, first time, second time, you didn't know which, what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">If you living or if you going to die now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Those who left their clothing were taken into a <span class="DLF">holding block</span> and Mengele's selections would last practically all day because by the time he completed - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> - by the time he completed the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , OK, after he finished the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , those who of course the clothing stayed behind were taken into another <span class="DLF">block</span> and waited until everybody was taken from all, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , then they were standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">You could hear them yell, scream, and beg for water, beg for, for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">They knew where they were going see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">See, and those of us who stayed, we picked up our clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Then with whips and sticks by the SS and by the Kapos and by the Blockaltester, by the Stubedienst, all the big-wigs of the prisoners and the SS, we were beaten into a, uh, <span class="INT_SPACE">shower area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And we bundled our clothing with a piece of wire with the number <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and threw them in a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , in, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , where Zyklon B gas was put on the clothing to disinfect the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">They disinfected the clothing while they disinfected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Spray a little water and they sprayed us with some disinfecting, uh, water, some sort of a disinfecter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And then they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where, where the clothing was, and you started looking for your clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">But the gas fumes were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And I'll never forget, I got weak and dizzy from the gas fumes one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And, uh, I was fainting and my friend, Buchler and Fisher, which I mentioned before, grabbed me under their arms and took me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and ran me back and forth, breathing for <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And that's how they got me through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">That's how I came out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I already had enough gas in me so if, if those two boys weren't there I wouldn't be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I would have died right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">So we picked up our clothing, we put our clothing on, were taken back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , back to our own <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">The other thing I remember about Mengele very vividly is when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">He was the one who would be in charge at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , at the <span class="DLF">siding</span> , at, at what they, the Nazis called it the Rampe, the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">When he came to the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> , the first thing he would do when he, when he, he had the people lined up, the able-bodied ones, he would get rid of those first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">He would ask them, how old are you, what is your profession, what is your name, , what is your profession and how old are you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And left, right, left, right and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">After he got rid of all these, of course, another thing he was looking, pregnant women and twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">We really didn't know what he was doing with them at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">But he would, he called them "Schlingen" (ph) [Zwillingen?], </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">the twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">He would take the twins into his <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I would see Mengele every transport and especially in early May 1944 when the Hungarian Jews were brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">When the Hungarian Jews came, Mengele was there constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">He had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , and he would ride in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> up and down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> just looking, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , looking for anything that he wanted to look at. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">Of course, we didn't know what he was looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Always afraid of this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I can still remember his, his piercing eyes and he'll, he'll, Mengele had dark hair and when he, when he, there were two people that we were deathly afraid of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Actually three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Palich (ph) was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Palich was another one who was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">He, Palich actually did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Palici's favorite thing was to do to line people up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> --Auschwitz I-- against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to see how many he could kill with one bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">A friend of mine, close friend of mine, knew of Palish quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I didn't know much about Palish except I knew who he was, that he was a murderer, and he also ride, rode a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">He would line up people, two three people in a row, see how many he could kill with one bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Lined them up together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And the third person, who also came in '43, actually end of '43 I think, whose name was Hauptsturmfthrer Moll, M - O - L - L. He became in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorias</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And also, he also was the mentor of the <span class="DLF">pits</span> , the <span class="DLF">pits</span> that they were digging because the <span class="BUILDING">crematorias</span> couldn't, couldn't hold enough people, burn and gas enough people fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">So he used the <span class="DLF">pits</span> to burn the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">But the <span class="DLF">pits</span> didn't work well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Because I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Greek transports</span> that came and and he, he took some of the Greek boys working the <span class="DLF">pits</span> and with bare feet they were, they were stomping the hot ashes for after the people, the hot coals after the people were, were burned tn there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And the bodies just kept, kept coming back up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1252">QUESTION:  To come back to, you were talking before about twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">You had mentioned a particular set of twins.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">ANSWER:  There was a French set of twins, French boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">One was already there already, Mengele already had him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And, I remember when they came for the second set...second guy, second person, the second twin, this poor boy yelled and screamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Oh yeah, I still...I can still just about hear his screaming, screeching, as they were taking him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">The Nazis came, the SS came to take this guy to Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And they took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">That's the last time we've seen him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">He was castrating the boys, lot of boys, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">QUESTION:  Did you actually see any of the experiments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1263">ANSWER:  No, I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">None of us have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">There, oh, I shouldn't say none of us have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">There was some doctors, prison doctors that worked with Mengele, but of course, we didn't, we didn't have anything to do with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1268">QUESTION:  What happened with the pregnant women? </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1270">ANSWER:  Only what I heard from, from people that were connected, that he was, uh, trying to, uh, uh, force the labor out, to pull the babies out of...out of their wombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I heard that from from other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And we knew girls that that worked...worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> that also knew some girls that worked closer to the, to the <span class="REGION">Krankenbau area</span> so a lot of times when Mengele worked in some of the sick, <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> - he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , he had <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there where he did the experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1273">QUESTION:  You talked about one other person, um, and that is the man whom you identified for OSI. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Can you talk about him and give us his full name and what did he do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">What did you testify?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1276">ANSWER:  His full name is Hans Lipsky (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">He's a Latvian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">Latvian national. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">He was an SS guard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">He worked the <span class="DLF">railroad sidings</span> where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">He was a murderer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">He was a killer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">To him, I...l remember, not only him but people like him, when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came, we would sometimes unload the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And take them off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">I remember one of the boys holding a little child, a little baby, and he takes out his pistol and shoots the baby in the, in the prisoner's hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">There was another one, Untersturmfuhrer Otto. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">There was a Graff and another one whose name was Hans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Hans would whistle, uh...uh, operas, and at the same time would murder these poor people coming off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Just right on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">Right on the <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">This guy would sing and, and murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I seen him once kick a kid like a soccer ball, when the kid was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Kicked him from his mother's arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And Hans Lipsky was a guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">He was not an officer, he was just a guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">A murderer, like most of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">And most of these people when they, those who guarded the the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> , would be drinking before they got there so that they were fortified, so that they could do, do this job better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">That was their ration, this booze. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And and I remember they they all had flasks with whiskey in it and they would just drink enough so they could be practically immune to anything that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So I identified Hans Lipsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">It's been five years now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Uh, from the OSI came a person who was at the time the Assistant Director; because then there was Ryan, who was the main person, and Neal Sher was in command. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">He got my name from some, some other Auschwitz survivors, and he asked me if I could come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to identify this person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">I said, well I don't think I can get away you know, so fast, so he said I must travel to see some people, could I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Indianapolis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">This is where I live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Could you meet me at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">So he came on a Saturday afternoon, and I met him at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and he identified themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">He checked in, and then we went to his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , he started to investigate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Started to actually interrogate me like I was one of the prisoners, one of the Nazis, the way he was going about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And, uh, after, he wrote everything, whatever I told him, he, he had it down, he had a tape, and one of the last things that he did, in his briefcase, he had eight mug shots of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And he told me, I want you to study these mug shot, mug shots, and if you can identify anyone, I want you to put your finger on it and hold it there and I'll let you know what to do next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">I looked at this mug shots, photo of eight, eight mug shots, and they were marked from one to eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And I looked, and I put my finger on number three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And I said, here is your man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And if I remember what I said to him, I said, and this is, this guy's name is Hans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And he said to me, Mr. Vogel, I want you to sign your full name under this photo, and date it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And all the other ones I want you to initial and date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And after I completed the, the paper work, he says to me, you have identified Hans Lipsky who's going to be tried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> on such and such and such a time and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And the trial was due to be the day after Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And on my way to work I was listening to NPR, National Public Radio, and they mentioned that Hans Lipsky elected to be deported instead of going to trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">He was deported to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">When I got to work I got a call from Neal Sher's office. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">This Eli Rosenbaum was working for Sher and he gave me the call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">He says, there is no trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Hans Lipsky elected to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">He is being deported to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">He's been by himself to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> but we do want you to know that if in case there is going to be a trial, would you be willing to go to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">And that is the last, last thing I heard about Hans Lipsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">He is probably living, ah, a life of Riley in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1330">QUESTION:  Anything you want to add to the tape, recollections...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1331">ANSWER:  Well, I give you a Sunday life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">Sunday was the day of rest for the Nazis, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">But the damn day of rest was sport, sport with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">For us, it was shaving each other, trying to get clean; which was almost impossible because water was nonexistent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">We shaved each other; and in summer time we tried to air our uniforms off, delouse ourselves with our hands, but that was not allowed by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">They would come and do calisthenics with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">They would make us go on our down below and do frog jumps, frog leaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And then they would make us roll on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Then roll back and forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Do push-ups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Get into the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> into mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">Roll in the mud in the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And if you didn't do it fast enough, you got beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And then they would beat us up because we were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Or muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Everyday in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , you never knew when your number came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Another thing was to see when you went to work, when you went to slave labor, who was no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">Who was, who's left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">And it became, it became like, like, like an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">Oh, I'm, I'm living another day, or he's, he's no longer, and and you know, the worst part, that you couldn't cry for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">You couldn't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">You couldn't cry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">You cried, you died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">If you, if you, 1f you show even more weakness than you already had, you didn't survive the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">You know, I remember once, here's another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">I got caught in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> Kommando picking up sardines and giving it to a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Gave this sardines as I was carrying the bundle, Nazi picks me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And a Kapo came there and the Kapo starts slapping me around, starts beating me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">So, for punishment I was put into a Strafkommando [NB: punishment brigade]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">And how do I translate Strafkommando? </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Straf is a...1s you being punished, "sin kommando." </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">I don't know if it translates well in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">Always the Strafkommando consisted of, first of all, the Kapo of the Strafkommando was a murderer, a former German prisoner who was a murderer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">He was our Kapo, our leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And the job was cutting seaweeds in water, with two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">It was, was a chain saw, it was a saw on a chain, like a, like a, how would you call tt, like , OK, that had sharp thing and you cut it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">And what the Nazi would do behind us, they would send a Kapo, a Unterkapo...an Unterkapo, his assistant, and they would dunk our heads in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> to see how long we can stay in, under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I was there for two weeks, and one of my friends paid off with a kind of riches, he paid off the proper people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And I was taken back into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And when I came back the SS man who caught me, the greeting would be such: . </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Till next time, you old bandit, you still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And they, in a way, they say, oh, this guy survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">They, they were, you know, say, look, what else I can do with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">Another thing that you learned as you became an older prisoner, to be at the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the right time, which was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">They, Nazis, SS would say, . </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">They would yell out, three men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">You went, most cases one of you didn't return. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">They would kill you as you were doing some sort of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And as you got an older, became an older prisoner, when an SS man called for three men, you would say, , cause they always meant three plus you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">You stayed behind, because if you went again, your first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I've got a mark on my neck here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I was hit by a shovel, on my neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I thought I was going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">That mark is still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">Also, when they called drei man, it was digging and wasn't digging fast enough, and the SS just hit me full force on my neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And they indented my neck, and its been there ever since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1388">QUESTION:  Did you ever think of escape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1389">ANSWER:  No, no, I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">When these two boys escaped, and when anyone escaped, we were in a way not happy about, about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And again I must explain, we didn't know what was going on on the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">But the reason we were not happy because we suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">We had to stand and on roll call until this poor soul was either caught, murdered, and then we were all beaten anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">Because the Kapos and Blockaltesters who were also out standing there at the roll call with us, they would be the ones who beat us because the Jew escaped, see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1395">QUESTION:  You had said before about the misconceptions about Canada Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Did some people believe you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">Could you talk about that and talk about the woman that you mentioned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1398">ANSWER:  Well, uh, now, uh, you know, after thirty years not speaking about my experiences, finally, our youngest daughter Elaine, who practically made me do what I'm doing today, speaking on Holocaust, and the most important reason 1s because I want to bear witness because very soon there will not be an Auschwitz survivor or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> survivor and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> will only be a legend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">But I must be very blunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I survived because of Canada Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">Good, bad or indifferent, I survived because I was assigned to work in Canada Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">But I must say that Canada Kommando was not just a group that worked unloading people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">We were told before we went to the transport what is expected of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">If any one of us will ever dare to tell the people what is going on, will not live the day through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">So now that I talk about it and I tell them that I survived and the reason, everyone survived for a reason, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> the Nazi law said that was no one can survive longer than three months on the food, the hygiene, and the work and and the torturing that he gets longer than three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">If you live longer than three months, you are doing something that is not according to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp's</span> rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">You either get more food someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">You do get more food someplace, or you have someone else helping you to to survive, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">So when I tell some people about <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , I told, I was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Indiana University</span> a couple of years ago, and I'm speaking to graduate students, a class of graduate students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">They were learning Holocaust, teaching Holocaust there, and I told the group about Canada Kommando, and of course questions and answers are usually very strong, and I really am quite immune to the questions because I answer them exactly, right from the shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">This young woman told me that her mother told her than the Canada Kommandos in her mind were murderers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">Murderers, because when she arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , 1t was the Canada Kommando who lined them up 1n rows of five and one of the Canada Kommando slapped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">And I said, "It is possible, but a Canada Kommando person was only doing what he had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">If he didn't do it he was shot right on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">He was murdered right on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And I give you another example, another little story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">I remember a transport came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">Early spring of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And we were unloading this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , busy, this was the busiest night I ever seen at the railroad, uh, <span class="DLF">siding</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">There was a young woman with a child with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And the child was restless and and crying, and the mother was trying to calm the baby, calm the child--six, seven-year-old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">All of a sudden, the mother looks; and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross truck</span> is moving towards us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">And she's telling the little girl, "Oh, Red Cross is already here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Pretty soon we will be in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">And a young Jewish Slovakian boy ran by there; and he told them, "Lady, that's not Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Take a look behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">You see the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">In one hour's time, you're going to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">You're going to be burned." </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And she went and sees an SS officer and tells him that, this woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">She tells the SS officer about this man: "This man told us you're going to gas us, you're going to burn us." </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">He said, "Look, Lady, he's a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Don't...he's going to be dealt with." </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">And he dealt with he was; because after we had loaded everybody, we all went behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and slowly they murdered him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Everyone of them just murdered the young boy slowly, just murdered the young boy slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">Carried him back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on our shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">You know what the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross truck</span> brought? </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">The Zyklon B gas cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">That's how it was carried into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">So that was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And there are so many things, you know, that...the...as I'm talking to you, there's just, you know, for a survivor, every survivor has a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">Is a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">The end is always, always the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">And every survivor survived because of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Not because he was strong; because the strong ones were falling just as easy as, as the weak ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">And really, none of us believed you're going to survive that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">It...it was...I'd been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> two and a half years; and I was in--between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , I was over three years just in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , plus so many months in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitlagers</span> (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">So from 1939 to 1945, we all suffered and, uh, uh, because of the Nazi regime and you know, every survivor, we didn't believe that we're going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">There 1s no survivor that will tell you I'm going to survive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">They never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">You know what the main, the most important thing was, to go to sleep at night with a full stomach, so if you die, you don't die hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">Another thing was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , "Organizierung"-- organizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">We all had to organize. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">We all knew how to barter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And of course, the resistance group, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">People say the Jews, we the Jews walked into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> like lambs, like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Believe me, those of us who were there a long time, we had an underground organization, without radios, without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">Communications such as we all knew how to communicate from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , somehow or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">For instance, there was a Leichen (ph) Kommando, which was the people that picked up the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">This man, he built a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and he built a false bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">This guy's name is Joe Newman (ph) and he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skokie</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And he would carry things to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">girls' camp</span> , information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">Information to person...you had him here not long ago, Erich Kulka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And Erich Kulka would carry it from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and to the resisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">To the girls that worked in <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">Which was Kulka's job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Kulka did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">Kulka was the one who, uh, got the girls from the <span class="BUILDING">munition factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And they got enough gun powder so the Sonderkommando blew up one of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorias</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Of course, they were murdered unfortunately, they were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1472">QUESTION:  Did you watch that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1473">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">We knew about it but I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">So you see, when, when people tell you that, uh, uh, surviving, those that survived, they are, they are a story, that's a different breed, and especially those who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as long as I have been, as long as, you know, myself and the others, Kulka, Vrba.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1477">QUESTION:  Did you help to smuggle information and material?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1478">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">From, we used to bring...for the escapees, we used, we used to smuggle stuff in ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1480">QUESTION:  Talk about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1481">ANSWER:  Uh, clothing for them, so they have civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And that would be given to group such as Kraus and Kulka, that type of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">Shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And we didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">They didn't tell us these tomorrow, you know, you never knew who would - there was a Hebrew word, a Yiddish word "moser." </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">A "moser" is a guy who tells on someone, who goes and snitches on someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">There was snitches among us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And the reason there was snitches, again, selfish, trying to survive that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">The Nazis, they didn't let them survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">They get their information, then they kill them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1492">QUESTION:  Would you tell me the story, an incident where you smuggled things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1493">ANSWER:  I was very small, and my pants were kind of big. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">I would be lined with clothing, civilian clothing <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , after examining us, the clothing would be in an <span class="REGION">area</span> as they put us in <span class="DLF">line</span> , some of us snuck in and you put the clothing in your pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">And we snuck it in and someone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> already knew that I had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">But you see, it was a dangerous thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">Because the Canada Kommando was not only searched on the <span class="DLF">Canada grounds</span> , we would also be searched sometimes at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">See. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">And if you got caught you got killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1500">QUESTION:  Who did you get the clothing for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1501">ANSWER:  The clothing would be picked up by a courier like, like, not a prisoner, who couldn't wore them anyway because he had to have a striped clothes like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">And he would take it to the person that would be doing the escaping.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1503">QUESTION:  You helped on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1504">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">Constantly.</span></p>
