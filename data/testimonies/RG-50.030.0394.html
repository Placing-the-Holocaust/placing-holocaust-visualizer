<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  I want to continue with that, but I -- I feel that we need to talk a little bit more about your family life, your Jewish identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Tell me --

<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Were they well off, what kind of business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  My parents were in the tailored supply business. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Everything in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was tailor made, every suit, and every dress, and every hat, and every underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And my parents had all the supplies for tailors. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And that was our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My father was originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and he came from a family of -- he had three brothers and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">His father died when he was young, and the mother was a real -- they call it a queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">She was a real go-getter, and she worked her boys real hard, and they were very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And as a matter of fact, I used to go visit them, and then my father would go to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> with his father, which was in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merkow</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And we went there every year, and in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merkow</span> is where my father had grown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And we went to visit where he used to live, and I had to stoop down, and be on a <span class="INT_SPACE">dirt floor</span> , that’s where he was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And they did very well, and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And they were in the dried fruit business, and my father was at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> checking out carloads of fruits going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when they came and said they were looking for him to go into the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So he got on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with the fruit, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And there he met my mother, and stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, that’s how I came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">His whole other [indecipherable] his family stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and as a matter of fact, they all ended up on Schindler’s list, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But my father became very Viennese, and loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and my mother was a very wonderful business woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">She’d rather be in business than at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And they always had somebody to keep me, either English miss to teach me English, or a French mademoiselle that teach me French. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So I knew a little bit of both languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Were you particularly religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Not very. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We belonged to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">conservative synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I remember the rabbi’s name, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And the men and women did not sit together, but because I was a young girl, I was allowed to sit with my father every now and then, and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But we only went for holidays, and I was confirmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And -- but we weren’t very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My mother did not grow up very Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Her mother was Orthodox, but her father grew up in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , and therefore wasn’t, and he loved to eat things that weren’t kosher, and -- to the great concern of my grandmother, who was. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And there was an interesting thing, my grandfather on my mother’s side, his father loved symphonies, and music, and so forth, and he was in -- attending a concert when fire broke out, and all the -- the <span class="DLF">doors</span> went in instead of out. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And many people died from the smoke inhalation, hundreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And when they told his mother that the father had perished, she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And she left two little children who grew up in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And he was still Jewish, but had not been brought up with a lot of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I was a mixture. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My father was -- came from <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox home</span> , but my mother didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And we never had any pork or seafood, or anything like that, but we weren’t kosher.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  You didn’t feel different, or your community didn’t see you different than everybody else 1S, Or --
ANSWER:  Not very, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">On holidays, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Also in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because we had religion in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and a given hour we separated, and I always thought that was terrible, I still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It made us different, and -- and that’s what I remember most.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Mar --
QUESTION:  -- in 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  This must have been very shocking to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  It was a complete shock to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was a life changing hour, and a growing up hour, and also of taking things in hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My mother was an extremely nervous person, very hysterical for everything, so I became the leader with my mother, because I was more calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so I aged very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">At that time, that day when everything went awry, my father started to say we’ve got to leave here. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But then, things happened so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The very first week of Hitler’s coming into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , somebody came with a rifle, knocked on our <span class="DLF">door</span> , and said, “Car keys.” </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That wa -- that’s all that -- that was the whole interchange, and we handed over the car keys. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And then somebody came and said, “I like this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My parents had bought it before they were married, and had put in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and -- a co -- like a co-op, they had done all the alterations and everything, it was ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And we had to be out 1n six hours or die. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And what do you do first? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Do you pack, do you find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , do you moo -- what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So one of my parents went and got boxes, and one went to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, and I started packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And in six hours we were out with as much as we could pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The rest we had to leave just like it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You know, we had all kinds of built ins, and things, and was all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And the -- we moved to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because it was an very old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and most of the people there had to move out quickly, had to move into <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that, so that was quite a shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We had two <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and you were no longer allowed to have employees that were not Jewish, and we always had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , living in, and she had to leave, and the people in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> could no longer help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So -- but they were still open, and we were trying to sell enough to have enough money to -- for every day things, because the bank accounts were closed, and all in all, this was our income. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So we lived like that until Kristallnacht -- Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Kristallnacht, we woke up in the morning, and my father had said -- we didn’t know it was happening, and my father said, “Things are getting so bad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="143">This was already November. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He said, “Why don’t I take some of our valuables to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and hide them there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And he took out cameras, and some jewelry, and -- and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And as he left the phone rang, and my girlfriend called and said, “Don’t let your father leave,” and hung up. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We had no idea what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You know, what people don’t realize is there was no television, and there was -- there was very little communication, so that nobody knew it was happening, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So about two minutes later, doorbell rang, and it was my father, and he said, “I’m lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I’ll never see you again, they arrested me, and they’re taking me away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I knew one of the men, and I ask him could I leave some keys with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So he had all this camera, and jewelry and all on him, and he took that and put it somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And then he put on long underwear because he was cold, and my mother was almost screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And then she had an idea, and she went next door to the neighbor, it was a Jewish woman with a son who was not well. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He was Si -- a very sickly man at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And she said to her, “Would you hide my husband?” </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And she said yes, and she put my father in her <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They came and took her son away, and she didn’t tell them that my father was hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Luckily at that time, there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> yet, so they send him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they -- they didn’t know what to do with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So we felt better that we -- you know, that my father survived, and he did, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But this is how it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was -- it -- it snuck up on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It -- it -- we couldn’t believe people would do things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So then we didn’t know what to do about my father, then we found out from the radio that the Viennese had 24 hours to do with the Jews as they pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And they were taking away Jews from everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Men. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They -- they put men into <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and things, but they had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the women yet, that came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But I went downstairs and got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxicab</span> , and my father laid down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> , and the cab driver did not give us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- one of our <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and we have a friend, a mutual friend of my husband and mine, who was helping us out in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and he had opened it that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And we went in there -- we closed the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with the <span class="DLF">iron gates</span> from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We wen -- we went in there and we closed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And this young man and I, and my mother and father stayed in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We had a telephone, and my girlfriend kept us aware of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She also sent somebody with some sandwiches to po -- put under the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We didn’t know how long we didn’t there -- we would be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We stayed about 30 some hours in there, and even though it was so terrible, we told stories -- we had no light, we couldn’t turn on a light. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">People knocked on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and we didn’t open. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And then finally my girlfriend says they have lifted this terrible thing that -- of Kristallnacht, and she said, you can come out now, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But we were still scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And when we looked out, the Nazis had put a swastika seal on the key lock -- on the -- where the key goes, and at that time the keys were these large keys with the long tops. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I took a key, the key from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and I unlocked it, and it didn’t tear. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Because that would have been certain death. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Nobody could hurt the swastika seal. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We ha -- w -- I had an aunt that wa -- had no husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">She lived with her sister and her daughter, and my father went in to hide there, because they didn’t expect a man to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And he spend the next two days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The young man that was with us, was -- they looked for him many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He would not have survived if he had been hiding with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">It was a horrendous day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  When you went out of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and this was right after Kristallnacht --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  What did you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">What was -- what was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  A lot of broken glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">All <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> had been torched, or broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">All the merchandise was either looted, or thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">It was -- it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And w-we couldn’t believe we survived it, or that my father survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And h-he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after two days, and we had no more <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , we had nothing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I remember going out of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , I even took money out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cash register</span> , I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But we -- we- thank God we survived it, and we were looking for ways to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">As you know, nobody wanted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">No <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> wanted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , most of the time just were closed to us, and you couldn’t get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> unless you had a permit to go to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So we had no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And then, after that, it was probably in January, my father got an invitation to come to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And nobody ever came back from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And that same day, the same friend was visiting me, and my father said, “I’m leaving.” </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And -- and my mother says, “Where are you going?” </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He says, “Pll find something, but I’m not going to the Gestapo.” </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And this young man said, “Please take me with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So they each put a shirt and a shaving brush into one of my dolls suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I still had dolls with suit -- I never liked dolls, I liked teddy bears -- and put it into little suitcases like that, they each had one. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And my father and I had made up a whole language between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And a few days later, I got a call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">My father said, “We’re here, we’re safe,” and he told me what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And what he did was this, he got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Well, there was no more <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but there was a <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And before he came to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , he contacted one of the waiters that looked simpatico, and he said, “I have money I’d like to give you if you would hide my friend and me under <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And he said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So they got under <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , they put tablecloths over them, and then they stood in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> while they searched the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">They found the two little suitcases, and nobody claimed them, so they searched some more. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In the meantime they had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">heating unit</span> in their back. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They said it was unbelievable, and they couldn’t move. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But they finally left, they couldn -- nobody knew what happened to these men. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So, when they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , my father said to this young man, “Get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and stretch, and act like you’re lighting a cigarette, like you’re going to get back on, because they’ll be looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And then make your way to the <span class="DLF">exit</span> , and go to the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and when you find the -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that has a kosher sign on it, they’ll help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And that’s exactly what they both did. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with a kosher sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They went in and told them they were refugees, and what should they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">These people knew -- these Jews knew that in an -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , they were giving 30 day permits to people to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So they made them up false papers, and they send one by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and one by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And that’s how they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And our family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> send us money -- send my father money so he could exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And my father said to me, “And you do the same with mother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I said [indecipherable] gave me all the details, he described the waiter, and said, “He said he would help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And have twice the money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So my mother and I packed up huge boxes, and send them to my father in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They did not get there, they took out all the valuables, but I do have my things that -- from my grandmother, and pictures, and all that really survived by going to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">My mother and I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that we knew he would be on. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> of people who were -- turn out to be some Jews, and there was one young man that had a shaved head. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He had already been to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they let him out and said, “If we catch you again, you’re dead.” </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Nobody had any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and I couldn’t tell them what we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I felt like a traitor, but I wasn’t going to say, because there’s no way that many could be under <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining car</span> , and I spotted the waiter, and I s -- I -- sit in front of me -- I had the menu in front of me, and I spoke to him, and I said, “I have twice the money, you promised my father.” </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I identified myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And he said to me, “Don’t speak to me, I’m being watched.” </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So here were my mother and I going into no man’s land. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> and one of the people there had gotten a telegram from a friend that -- on the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Achen</span> -- no, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , there was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , an <span class="BUILDING">hourly hotel</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">fleabag hotel</span> , who would allow Jews in -- un-under the eaves for a certain amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So we went with them to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it was a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And they put us all under the eaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They also had people there that smuggled people across, that came there, and for money they said, “We’ll get you across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So we -- we did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I was a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">There was a waiter there who liked me a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">My mother was hysterical with this, there was nobody to protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I[ had to really get out of his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I learned a lot very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And then we started with trying to be smuggled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It took five weeks of unbelievable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We were caught five times. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">There was ice and snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">My mother had a 105 temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And we used to walk like half the night through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and then be caught and sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They didn’t know what to do with the women, the men disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  Were you -- when you were doing this, were you with other people, or was just you and [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yeah -- no, they usually took five or six for one trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Some of them had bought out the border police, but not all of them, just some of them, and they’d let us go on, and then later on we’d hear a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> coming, we’d throw ourselves in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Then we’d hear a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , and that didn’t catch us, but then the man came on his mot -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and he caught us. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We once made it to no man’s land, to a -- we had walked all night, and I had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> so bad, and they had an <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> surrounded by German border police so I couldn’t go, cause they all liked me, because I was a young, big girl with no protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I -- we sat -- we were soaked to the skin, and we sat and waited to be picked up from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And the German border police came and send us back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And one of the -- one of the people there had send me a note that he was in love with me, and that he knew what I was doing, and he wanted to join me when I got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I should -- gave me his name and address I should write to him, and I said sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And when the border police came in, I dropped it under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , I didn’t want to be found with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And that was a terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Each time they send us back as far as our money would go, and you become very wise, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">The men disappeared, the women were sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">You become wise, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">You become street-wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So after five weeks of this, constant trying to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> with fashing, which is Mardi Gras time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , going on with -- they wouldn’t even have us at that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , we found some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and my mother was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And we were like up under the <span class="DLF">eaves</span> , and had -- we had no ration cards either, so we couldn’t buy any food, and I would go out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I found this little <span class="BUILDING">cheese shop</span> , cheese and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And the proprietor was this very jolly, nice, fat man. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And I went in and I said, “I don’t have a ration card, but I’m hungry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And every day he sold me cheese and bread, or every few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So he was a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And my accent was Viennese, so in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they knew immediately that I wasn’t from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So they knew what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I once fell down a whole flight of <span class="DLF">steps</span> , and two German officers picked me up, and I couldn’t say thank you, because they would have known immediately that I wasn’t German. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We had a lot of terrible incidents like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And then one day my father called and said he had found a Gestapo man who wanted money out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he was smuggling people across. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he send him to us and told them he would pay him on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , so he could get money. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">This man made us first go to the border police and be searched. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">We were searched each time, everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">There was a woman searching women, and a man searching men all over the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And then he took us -- we had to walk about three hours through the night, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then he picked us up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> without lights, and we drove for two hours without lights, at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And then we drove into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and he delivered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I went into hiding for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I couldn’t -- I was afraid to go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">It was an after in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I had another incident before that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when they made me wash the <span class="DLF">streets</span> one day, the people that I knew and grew up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And they taunted me, and they send away all the other people and they surrounded me, and started touching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And German officers came in and stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And I cried for two days and two nights, and had to have a shap to stop it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So here went again, I was scared to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I was real brave until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and then I be -- I just let loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And after two weeks of not leaving the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , my parents made me go to a movie with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">What they didn’t know is there was a Communist giving a speech for the movie, and I was so afraid, because you get so afraid of anything political, or anything that has to do with the law, and --
QUESTION:  Must have been quite a reunion, though.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Oh, unbelievable, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And then it came to where you had to get a p-permit every 30 days, and that -- that was another thing that was almost impossible to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We couldn’t work, and -- but somehow, I was young, I still went dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I had made friends, I went dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But it was tough, very tough, and we got permits, and then we had this little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was very nice, and the landlord wanted more money, we really couldn’t afford it, and so he told us to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And we hadn’t gotten out, and he called the police and said we were refugees without permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And the police came, and we had a permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But after they left, my father was going to kill that man. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I mean, he lost his composure completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The man lived upstairs and my father was running up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , and I ran behind him, and I pulled him, and I said, “Don’t do that, don’t do that,” you know, “you'll kill all of us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But he was -- went berserk that somebody could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Luckily he wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so he didn’t kill him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Was your father working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> ?</span></p>
