<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  ....name, date of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Milton Green, and I’m 82 years old and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lowell</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> but we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lowell</span> when I was about five years old to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> , Mass. And we went to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , I went to <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> since I was about five years old till even now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  ... growing up, family, religious background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Yes, I moved to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> in 1925 and I have a twin sister anda brother and another sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> which is a <span class="BUILDING">Reform temple</span> and the head of that <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> was Rabbi Levy, was a well known rabbi in those days and it’s a <span class="BUILDING">Reform temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And my parents were quite religious and I was actually bar mitzvahed at a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> and also went to <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And we observed all the holidays or most of the holidays but specifically we weren’t really terribly religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We didn’t, we didn’t have kosher set up and all but we always went at different holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and we still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But our religious training was, was moderate. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> and it was a <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Edward Devotion School</span> and us that’s when I started to be interested in track and I was captain of the erammar school track team. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was named Charles Taylor and he was very interested in my athletic activities and he really encouraged me especially in track. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="11">Cause in those days I held a record in high jump when I was eleven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And he was sort of sponsoring me in all activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And then I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I was captain of the track team there. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And held quite a few records in the interscholastic meets and that was in 19382. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And then I went <span class="BUILDING">Exeter Academy</span> for one year in preparation to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and while I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , I, well I was at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> rather in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I met this Norman Carnis who eventually became my roommate and he was an outstanding track athlete too. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He was a hammer thrower and also a hundred yard dash runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And in 1935 there was a Harvard-Yale track team that competed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> against <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford-Cambridge</span> and Norman Carnis was a hammer thrower mostly at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And they didn’t have the hammer throw in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford-Cambridge</span> meet so he trained in the 100, 220 and made the team in the hundred and the 220 which was an unusual combination, a hammer thrower and a hundred year dash. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I was in the, in three events. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">At the Oxford-Cambridge meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">That was in 1985 in the high hurdles, the low hurdles, and the running broad jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was called broad jump that time but it’s called the long jump now. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And I won two events at the Oxford-Cambridge meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And we, I’ve been always thinking and wanting to be in the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And of course that was my hope to be in the Olympics but in 19386 in the Harvard-Yale game, the Harvard-Yale track meet, Carnis and myself had won six of, six gold medals between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And there was quite a bit of publicity about it and about our Olympic plans and whether we were going to the Olympics or whether we could qualify. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I had qualified for the final tryouts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I got a certificate from Avery Brundage and I think I had submitted to your group the certificate from Avery Brundage saying that I had qualified for the final tryouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  ... without mentioning the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , got the certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Yes, I had, I received a certificate from the American Olympic committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Avery Brundage. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And it stated that I had qualified through all the preliminary tryouts for the final tryouts at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And about at that time, there was some publicity in the Boston papers about my roommate and me, Norman Carnis and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">There was a picture of us winning six gold medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And some of the executives or the committee members at <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> and Rabbi Levy had seen the publicity and knew that we were potential Olympic candidates. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And one of the committee members called me and said he would like, congratulated me for our performance at the Harvard-Yale track meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And said that Rabbi Levy would like to talk to us about the Olympics and the potential there. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And could we meet with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we met with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">At <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And they explained to us what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The terrible things that were going on and all the activities against the Jews and people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And we, we sort of knew something about the problem of ( +) but not in any great details. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And were really quite taken aback with information that they gave to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And then he, and at that time it was suggested that it might be a good idea for us not to go to the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Because of all this, these problems that sort of register our objections and sort of boycotting the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And we were quite taken aback about that thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They tried to explain to us that we would never regret if we did take that action, to boycott the Olympics and they suggested that we talk it over and let them know what, what our thoughts were, if we wanted any further discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And we, Norman Carnis and I went back and talked it over and thought we had discussed it with our parents as we had great respect for their judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And after talking it over with our parents, they also called Rabbi Levy to see what his thoughts were again. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">To get an explanation from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And my father told me that he was satisfied and had confidence in Rabbi Levy’s judgment and that we wouldn’t regret it if we did boycott the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Of course the problem was, not the problem but the question was we, you know how imminent our selection onto the Olympic team would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I held the world’s record in the high hurdles and also the Harvard- Yale record in the broad jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And at that time and the Harvard-Yale broad jump event which I held the record in was over 24 feet, 11 inches. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I had been running in three events at that track meet and the coach said not to take too many jumps because I had to save myself for the other events. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And on the first try on the broad jump I had fouled the take off, stepped over the mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And he said to be very careful on the next jump because he didn’t want me to take all my full jumps. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So on the next <span class="DLF">jump</span> I was very careful and took off about a foot behind the take off board and I did 24 feet 11, so I was close to 26 feet in the actual jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And they thought that I could, had a good chance of qualifying for the Olympics in the long jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Where I had the potential to go close to 26 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And in the high hurdles, which was the other event that I was, had qualified for, I had been running around 14, 9, 15 seconds in the high hurdles and the qualifying times were in the 14 second, probably 14, 2, or 3, but I was improving in the high hurdles and I practiced timing event, timing in the high hurdle practice rounds and I was getting closer to the 14, 5, 14, 4. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And they felt that there was a good chance that I could make the team in maybe two events. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But at any rate, after the discussion with Rabbi Levy and my parents and this whole situation about boycotting, both Carnis and I decided that we would boycott the Olympics and we didn’t go into the finial tryouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And although I was disappointed I felt that that was the thing to do and that’s what basically happened, as far as boycotting the Olympics [were] concerned because that time I was a senior at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and I was interested in getting into business and whether to go into business right away, after graduation which was in 19386 or to go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And now I decided to go to <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Business School</span> and then go into the <span class="BUILDING">real estate business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So I was interested in looking, I was always interested in athletics. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I knew that I was a pretty good athlete and as I say I was captain of all the track teams since I was in <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But my focus after getting out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> was not, had nothing to do really with athletics, although I was interested in all athletics and tennis and skiing and all the other activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But I decided to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Business School</span> and then to go into business in the <span class="BUILDING">real estate business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And that’s what happened and I was interested in, you know, finding a nice gal and getting married too. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So that’s the basic course that I followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And after I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> I participated in tennis. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I was ranked number six in <span class="REGION">New England</span> in the super senior category so I was always interested in athletics but that’s really the basic story about what happened in the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  ...elaborate on some of those points...came from a Jewish background, identified as a Jewish boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  That’s right, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My mother and father as say were Reform at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">When I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> in 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But their parents were very religious, my mother’s parents particularly because my father’s parents weren't around at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But my mother’s parents, the name was Waburn and they were very religious and we used to go over to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and celebrate all the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And as I say they were very religious and my parents were religious but they were Reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  What about your friends, were your friends mixed or did you really erow up 1n a more Jewish environment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  I'd say that I grew up basically in a mixed environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">After we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> , in 1929 we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">Newton High School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">In those days it wasn’t too integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And my friends, I’d say were 50/50 Jewish and non-Jewish and so our upper’ _~was [difficult to figure out what was missing here], was mixed but our social activities were mostly Jewish activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism from your classmates or people when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="91"><span class="BUILDING">High school</span> , never noticed any. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I knew it was around and there were situations but in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> we lived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carnis</span> and I lived in <span class="BUILDING">Lowell House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And they had common <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> eating and we mixed with all of the, everyone there and we, we never noticed any particular anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But we knew it existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But we were never particularly subjected to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Do you think that sports in your early athletic career provided a good opportunity for you to fit into the main stream and move beyond your Jewish environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  I never particularly thought of it in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But it was the focus that you know put us in contact with all the...
QUESTION:  ... start the sentence by saying sports or athletics was the focus so that you say the subject in the sentence...
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">You know sports and athletics were a focus. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Because as I say I was captain of the team so I was, did pretty well in all the events. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">While it was a focus and I enjoyed it, it wasn’t 100 percent focus. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But I trained carefully and did all the training that the coaches had suggested but I would say it was a focus but not 100 percent so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  And you mentioned that you had worked toward going to the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Was that a real serious possibility in your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Going to the Olympics was a very serious focus at that time and it was a focus on training and doing extra training and exercises too and I was watching the performances all over the world, in my particular events, particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And yes it was something that I was always thinking about when I was training and I had hoped to make the Olympic team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  So it must have been somewhat disappointing when, even though it was your choice, you weren't going to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  It was my boycotting the Olympics through the meetings I had with Rabbi Levy, yes I was, I was disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And felt that that focus that I had had all these years was going to materialize but somehow or another I felt that it was the right thing to do and I never had any regrets about it one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  What gave you that moral grounding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well I don’t think the moral grounding in relation to that was not really a basic factor. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I don’t think it had anything to do with moral erounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was just a realization that was something that should be done and I had great respect for Rabbi Levy because prior to our meeting with him, although I had heard about the problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what was going on, I didn’t really have a detailed understanding of the problems there and that meeting was really a shocker to both Carnis and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And it struck <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to me that that was something I wanted to do after they explained the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  You talk about this meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Can you go into more detail about what they said to you and what helped you make this choice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Well the meeting with Rabbi Levy was at the Temple Israel executive boardroom. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we weren't sure what he was going to tell us about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But the several board members of the men’s committee and the rabbi went into pretty good detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But I don’t remember all the items that they discussed particularly, but they told us about the terrible things that were going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And it was a shocker to me and Norman Carnis and it just struck <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that 1t was something that we should do or consider doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But I don’t remember particularly all the gory details that they went into.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of the details?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Something about book burning and taking away the rights of the Jews and putting them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and I suppose it was — I don’t remember it was that time or afterwards, but they mentioned about the killing of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And then all those details were pretty repulsive to US.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Were there at that point to your knowledge, press statements or public statements about boycotting and about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Yes there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was publicity about the boycotting and discussions between the Olympic Committee and there were some other groups that were, had mentioned in the press about they should boycott the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And there were other groups that said they shouldn’t boycott the Olympics so I was just aware that there was a discussion going on about boycotting but I wasn’t aware of all the details involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Were you aware of other athletes who were considering boycotting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I did, I wasn’t aware of any other athletes that I knew of and I wouldn’t be in contact with them other than through publicity in the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But I remember something about Stoller and those track athletes that were questioning about going to the Olympics but I don’t particularly remember the time frame in connection with that but I do remember the discussion about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Did the press and some of these organizations who were talking about boycotting influence you or....
ANSWER:  No, I didn’t think the press or the publicity influenced me one way or the other because I wasn’t aware at that time in any great detail of the problems going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the Nazis with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I knew there were problems and it was serious but I wasn’t aware of all the details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  When you decided to boycott was this primarily to take a stand or was there any concern about your safety in going over there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  No, I wasn’t worried at all about safety but the reason I boycotted it was entirely a result of the meeting with Rabbi Levy. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">That was the essential dominant factor involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Did you consider this a substantial sacrifice on your part? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I mean you had been working for this for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Well boycotting the Olympics was a sacrifice because I had always wanted to be in the Olympics but I didn’t consider it as, once we made up our mind and I was aware of what was going on there, I didn’t look at it particularly as a sacrifice, although it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But I didn’t consider it a terrible blow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Once you made the decision to boycott, were you asked to or did you make any public statements in an effort to influence other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We never made any public statements or indicated what steps we had taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  When you were in a pretty high profile position. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You were captain of varsity track in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , I’m surprised that someone didn’t come to you and say will you speak out for this boycott.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Well after we boycotted the Olympics, no one came to speak to us or ask us if we'd make any statement about it and I don’t think anyone knew particularly that we did boycott it. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Cause there was no publicity about it one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The only publicity we had was when I spoke to the track coach at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">His name was Yacko Macola. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He was the assistant coach but he was the — 1n 19386 he was the track coach, and we told him about our intention and he tried to persuade us not to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He said he didn’t think we’d do much good and we should try to go to the final tryouts and try to make the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But we didn’t want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And that was the only conversation we really had about it, publicity wise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  ...ask you about where you were during the games and....[tape ended and new tape began with the following.] </span><span class="sentence" id="159">When we stopped you were telling me that you and Norman Carnis, your roommate went and told your Harvard track coach of your decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Can you expand upon that a little?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  We, I went to see the track coach, Norman Carnis didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Let me rephrase that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  You went and told your coach who you had been working with at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> of your decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Yes, I told Yacko Macola. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I went to see him and told him that we had decided not to go into the final tryouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  ...say that again...
ANSWER:  Well I went to see, to tell my track coach at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , Yacko Macola, that we weren't going to go into the final tryouts and told him the reason that we had spoken to our religious leader, Rabbi Levy, and that we had decided because of the situation that we were told about that we weren't going to go to the final tryouts and he was quite disturbed — not disturbed but felt that we should really go ahead and we ve always wanted to be in the Olympics and he thought we had, that I had a great chance to qualify in two events. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And that we, that I should really try to change my mind about going to the final tryouts but he didn’t persuade us, persuade me rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And that was the extent of the discussion with Yacko Macola, the coach.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Did other colleagues of yours on the track team at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> go the Olympics or go to at least the final tryouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  None that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">There was no one else that had qualified for the final tryouts from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , except me. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I had no discussion with them at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We were, I think, having final exams and eraduation around June 10* or 12*h and I had no discussion with anyone about the final tryouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  You were focused on sports; you were focused on your scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You really weren't at that point — it doesn’t sound like that focused on being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And yet this meeting at your <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> was very compelling to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Well, no, I was focused on being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I was focused on being Jewish because I felt loyal and loyalty to Judaism and I had no, we had contact with non-Jews in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and everything but that wasn’t a problem as far as I was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Let me ask you where you were at the time of the games?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  At the time of the Olympic games I was working at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> as a counselor up in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterville</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It was called <span class="BUILDING">Cedar Crest Camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I don’t think they had television at that time or they didn’t have it at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But I remember of course eagerly reading the papers on the results and figuring out the times that they were winning the events in and the distances in the long jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So I was following it very carefully but I didn’t, I don’t remember seeing them actually on TV, but I did later on, on the re-runs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  What about newsreels in the <span class="BUILDING">movie houses</span> , anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Well we didn’t go to the movies at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  The radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think we had, I think there was a radio we were listening to> I don’t remember what the time factor was between the events and the time zone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterville</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Do you remember how you felt as you were following the Olympics? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Wistful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was, I was thinking about how it would have been to have been running in those events and now whether I could have been a medal winner and I was thinking in those terms but I didn’t focus as far as actually winning the event at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Were you sorry you weren't there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  I suppose in a way I was because as I say I had been thinking about it for all those years, so I was in a way feeling that if I could have made the team and | thought I could that I would have liked to have been in that Olympic setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Isn’t the Olympics a real dream? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">What does it mean to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Well now that’s the peak of training or one of the peaks, one of the objectives to be in the Olympics as I’ve gone to a lot of the Olympics to see it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and I’m going to the Olympics in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> this summer with my grandchildren and I always watch those track events with great interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  Did you feel any resentment about the other athletes who chose to compete, especially the Jewish ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  No, I had no feelings about the Jewish athletes that competed. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I didn’t know them number one, but I had no feelings one way or the other about their competing, I mean that was up to them and I had no resentment at all about those that did go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Do you think the American government should have made more of a stand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  In retrospect, I certainly do. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I think they should have definitely boycotted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  I need you to say the American government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Well as far as the boycott is concerned, I think the American government definitely should have boycotted the Olympics in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> just like they boycotted the Russian Olympics and now they would have all the more of the facts than I ever had and I think it was definitely a mistake that they didn’t boycott the Olympics in 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Do you think it would have made a difference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Yes, I think it would have made a great difference to have the American government show their opposition to what was going on over there in the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I think they made a serious mistake not to boycott it and I know that there was a lot of talk pro and against the, boycotting the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But I think this is a result more in retrospect rather than at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But as I think of it now, I definitely think it was a mistake not to boycott it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  Did you feel at all alone in your decision, as you were following the games?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Well I had no recollection particularly of what my feelings were at that time in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">But it wasn’t any great feeling that I had cause once I made up my mind and felt that it should be that I should go or try for the final tryouts, I didn’t lose any sleep over that decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  It’s really hard for me to imagine that you had been training, that this was a real dream of yours and you made this decision for all of the right reasons but that you weren't a little bit torn apart by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  No, I don’t, as I remember it, I didn’t, I don’t remember being particularly torn apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">No, I had a longing and a desire to have been in it, but I didn’t have as I look back on it, I don’t remember having any terrible regrets for having made the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  Never a second thought?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Never a second thought on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Now let me ask you a sort of a different question. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I think you made a pretty bold and moral decision, however you want to phrase it in 19386. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Do you think as you look back on the times since then, do you think that that decision impacted the way you live your life or taught you an important lesson or really meant something very special?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Well my decision not to participate in the final tryouts, I don’t think had any great impact on my future one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I mean I participate in athletics and as I said, I was pretty lucky to be performing and held the world’s record and Harvard records and was in the Harvard Hall of Fame for athletes and it had no particular impact one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Did it encourage you when there were other tough decisions to take the <span class="DLF">high road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Did you learn anything from it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Well no, I don’t think, I mean I felt good that I made the decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But I don’t, as I said I don’t think it had any impact as far as my future activities or living or philosophies were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It had no great impact one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  It’s a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Do you ever think back on that period and what you went through at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think back on making that decision and whether I would have on or not — silver or gold or some sort of a medal and every time I go to the Olympics, I’ve been to three of them and I watch, I particularly watch the <span class="DLF">high hurdles</span> and the long jump and I picture myself as maybe having won a medal on it, an Olympic medal. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But I participated in the Senior Olympics in 1983 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Florida Senior Olympics and I won ten medals at that but that was not the real Olympics, that was the Senior Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So I, you know I’ve won medals in Olympic senior competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  Since that time you've heard and read a lot about the 19386 Olympics and the extent of the pageantry and the celebration and the propaganda and all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Do you think that sports can be separate from politics or that they’re just inextricably linked in situations like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Well I think sports can be separated from politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">In a way they should be but 1t depends on what the separation is. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I mean interference by the government, particularly in sports, I wouldn’t like to see that but this 1s a, the boycotting is different, I don’t consider that a mixing of sports and politics or a separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I mean I think that’s a moral eround and I just think that they should have been boycotted; the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> should have boycotted it, not because it’s — there’s separation of those activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But I just think they should have just the way they did in the Russian Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION: <span class="COUNTRY"> Germany</span> certainly didn’t separate sports and politics in 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Well I imagine they didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I think that’s all my questions but I just want to make sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Tell me about how this meeting came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Who was there, why they called you in, what the atmosphere was like and what you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Well I remember after the Harvard/Yale track meet, which Carnis and I won six gold medals there was quite a bit of publicity in the newspapers and there was a picture of Carnis and myself in the sport page. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I forget which paper it was, and saying how we'd won six gold medals and I think they called us Damon and Pythias because we were such good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">About three or four days after the track meet, I got a phone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I forget what the fellow’s name was but he said he was calling at the request of Rabbi Levy. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And he was on the men’s council of the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> and he had read about what we did at the Harvard/Yale track meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And that he understood we were contenders for the Olympics and he had some important information that he’d like to talk to us about at the request of Rabbi Levy and as I had mentioned, Rabbi Levy was the head of <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Reform Temple</span> , and he was well- respected all over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I was confirmed at <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> and naturally when they asked us to come, or asked me and Norman Carnis, we agreed to come and | think it was set for two or three days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  What was going on 1n your mind, why they had called you over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  He said something about he wanted to talk to us about the Olympics and so I wasn’t particularly prepared, I didn’t know what they were going to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Except that something about the Olympics and we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">boardroom</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Temple Israel</span> on <span class="DLF">Commonwealth Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , that’s where the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> was at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And we went there and they explained about the reason they wanted to talk to us was in connection with what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And they explained the problems that were going on there with the Nazis and the terrible things that were happening to the Jews there and I don’t remember the exact details of exactly what items they were talking about but it was a terrible picture as I remember it and they discussed it fully and we told them that, I told them that I was preparing to go to the final tryouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And that I’d qualified and had to get prepared for it and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again and they explained to me that again it was a terrible situation there in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they suggested that they thought it would be a very good idea to boycott the Olympics and they were quite sure that I'd never regret it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Even though I had my heard set on being in the Olympics and they suggested that you know it was up to me and Carnis decided what we wanted to do and so I told them that we'd talk it over and let them know what we wanted to do and that was the basic situation as far as that meeting is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  And they really left it up to you that decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  that’s right, they left the decision entirely up to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They didn’t say you had to or they indicated, they recommended strongly that it was the right thing to do and we would never regret making the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  Why was all this so compelling? </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You were excited, you were ready to go to the tryouts, the finals and that meeting really turned you around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Yes, that meeting really turned us around because we were horrified at what the terrible things that were going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we just felt it was the right thing to do and made up our mind to do it after as I say we, I talked it over with my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  After the meeting did you go immediately <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Did you consult with your parents, or your friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">What took place next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Well I was living at the <span class="BUILDING">Lowell House</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> at the time with Norm Carnis and we went back and talked it over and decided that I'd vo <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and talk things over with my parents, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and talked it over with them and as I explained, my father called Rabbi Levy to find out if I had the right report. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And after his discussion with Rabbi Levy, he felt that the rabbi had a complete understanding of the whole situation and he could rely on his judgment and that I should rely on his judgment and he said that you know left it up to me but he strongly recommended that I go along with the suggestion from the rabbi and the men’s committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I think the head of the Men’s committee I think it was a fellow named Kimler or something close to it, or Kimmel or Kemla, it’s some name like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Did you follow the trials at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randalls Island</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Yes, I followed it to see what they were doing and...
QUESTION:  Begin that sentence....
ANSWER:  Yeah, I followed the trials at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randalls Island</span> cause I was you know very much interested but as I say, I had no regrets after deciding not to go into the final tryouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  When you were following those tryouts, how were your times compared to the times that qualified people? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Would you have probably gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  I don’t remember the details of the times at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">As I recollect now I think I could have made the team at two events — the long jump and the high hurdles. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I’m pretty sure I could have done it in the long jump, I’m not that certain about the high hurdles. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Because it depended on how much I improved at my timing there and really concentrating on that event, but I don’t remember the details particularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  Go back for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">When you received the certificate from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brundage</span> saying you had qualified for the finals, what was it like getting that letter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  I was very pleased but I knew that I had qualified because I won the preliminary events and knew that the winning of those preliminary events would get me into the finial tryouts but I liked the certificate and I was you know very pleased to have it and I framed it and kept it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  When you followed the games from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , did your campers follow them with you and did they know that you were in this world class...
ANSWER:  Yeah, they knew I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Can you say my campers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  Yeah, when I was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cedar Crest camp</span> during the Olympics in 19386, most of the campers knew I was a good athlete and was material for the Olympics and the year before I was in the Oxford-Cambridge meet and there was quite a bit of publicity and they talked about it when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So yes, there was quite a bit of talk about the Olympics and whether I could have gotten a medal or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  A more personal way to follow the games.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  After “36 you went on to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Yes I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Did you, during the war were you in the Army or...
ANSWER:  Yeah, I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I enlisted in the Navy aviation and I was in 1943 I volunteered for the Navy aviation and I was in a <span class="BUILDING">naval squadron</span> which at that time was a scouting squadron. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was Scouting Squadron 31 and I came in as a lieutenant junior grade which is the equivalent to a first lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I came out in 1945 as a lieutenant commander and our...
QUESTION:  Overseas and all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  Our <span class="BUILDING">squadron</span> was an anti-submarine squadron and we were patrolling for and escorting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> out of <span class="DLF">Boston harbor</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , <span class="DLF">Maine harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And after the VE Day we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">squadron</span> was being prepared to go out to the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I wasn’t a part of it but I was what they call an air combat intelligence officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And then the war ended, while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> and about a year, six months later I guess it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So I was in the service in the Navy from "42 I guess to ’46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  At what point did you, after ‘86, at what point did you start, when did you start learning about what was unfolding in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Well I followed the war very carefully, of the campaigns in <span class="COUNTRY">North Africa</span> and all the different campaigns and was watching it very carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But I wasn’t particularly aware of any more activities in Nazi Germany at that particular time other than what was going on in the papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Did you know about Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Yeah, I remember reading about that and all the terrible things that were happening there and that revolted me tremendously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Did you feel vindicated in your decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  I never looked at it in that vein; I never looked at it in the idea I was vindicated or not vindicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Because I felt it was the right thing to do when I made that decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I didn’t think it was in any other terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">THE END </span>
