<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay, The camera's on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Thomas Buergenthal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubochnia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Would you tell me something about your parents, please? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Where did they come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  My mother came — well, my — actually, my — both of my parents came to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They got, came there when Hitler came to power; and I was born there shortly after they got to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Tell me about growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Did you grow up there? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And your very early years, before the Nazis came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  What little I remember, really, in that period: I grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , very uneventfully; a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">From what I remember, what little I remember, a very pleasant environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  You moved at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Where did you move to, again, before the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, we moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubochnia</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zilina(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The—my, my father had bought a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubochnia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that was designed to be for German political refugees awaiting the fall of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father thought that Hitler would not last more than four years, and he wanted to be nearby and have his friends there. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Well, by, by 1938, very few people could come out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> wasn't going very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And at that point, we left the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zilina(ph</span> ).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">What happened there, when by 1938, '39? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Did things change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Well, the — in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , the Hlinka, Hlinka Guard, which was a fascist group aligned with the Nazis, began harassing Jews and looking for certain people, and my father was one of the people they apparently had on, on some list. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It became clear to us that if we didn't leave the risk — at least, the risk to my parents — that the risk was very great. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And that at some point, shortly before the German invasion, we tried to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It took about a week to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> , 1n, in no-man's-land between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and, and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The last time when we — in no-man's-land, when we went — were shipped back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , then the Germans were already there, in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And it was curious that it was the Germans who actually helped us get into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  How do you mean, helped you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Well, the Germans didn't realize who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And my father told them that he was Polish, and that the Poles wouldn't let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And so they actually carried our suitcases and told the Poles that they had to let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And that's how we entered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Okay, Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But you entered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Well, we had political refugee status, my father, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> , in southern — in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to await our entry, or the right to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My father had papers that would have allowed him to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We registered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> with the British Consul and waited there until we were supposed to be called up to, to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And it was really on the day when the Germans moved into, into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , on September first that we were supposed to be leaving for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And we actually left. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">What happened was that the British Consul — there were quite a number of refugees in our position — were put ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> chartered by the British to take us to the, to the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> , and hopefully, from there to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> — never got very far; because we were bombed by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> and had to abandon the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> not, not very far from the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And at that point, the question was: “What do what do we do next?” </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My, my father actually went and crossed into, into the Soviet Union, across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug River</span> ; and came back and decided — actually, he had crossed over to see whether we should go to the Soviet Union — crossed over and decided that we weren't going to be much better off there than if we Stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And we then marched with the refugees on the, on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and were actually taken over by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> on, on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> near some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">After a while, we ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> more or less in <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , and eventually ended up in the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Tell us — by then, you are five. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Tell us, if you can —
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">By then, I'm — yeah, five. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Yes, six.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Tell me what you remember of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> was, was — at least from what I remember initially, or maybe in retrospect — it's often very hard to keep these things apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I had never se — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> really had a very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , and I've since found out that there were more than twenty thousand Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> — a long tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">There were a lot of very religious Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There were <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and everything — things I had never seen before in — 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , where, where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There were — let me see, what else do I remember from the initial period? </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was another language — two languages, in fact: both Yiddish and Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Initially — again, until things, until 1941, '42, things were not all that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was when the when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established, all the Jews were herded into one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Food became very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Housing became very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We lived in, in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that my father and mother and I shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And food was very difficult to come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">A lot of, lot of hunger, but still not as serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There were still a lot of people who lived quite well, who had, had ways of getting food into the, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , especially in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Things gradually became harder and harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And the, the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were — protection was built up much heavier than initially. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Initially, 1t was still possible for people to go in and out, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But after a while that became more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Then, of course, in 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Most of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — I would think about some close to 20,000 people — were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> ,” and that included my grandparents as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That was sort of the first really serious killing experience that, that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">During — I should note, though, that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> itself there were — if not daily, certainly sporadic — killings going on by Germans of people, German guards of Jews on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">At the same time, there appeared to be some sort of normalcy that, that reigned, but then in '42, all of that came to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Can you describe the deportation? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">What did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well, the, the—one morning we were awakened with screaming and shooting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> — orders in German: "Everybody out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And whoever wasn't to be out would be would be shot, and apparently a lot of older people, others who couldn't move, were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My father, who was, was a very cool person — that's sort of the, the memory I have — wasn't going to move until he had shaved and had time to think what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And — actually that's what saved us because he took a group, he took us and a group of people out and marched us to — he had been in charge of a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> — and marched us out to the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , saying that he had orders to protect the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and keep the, the people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And that's — and safeguard a number of people, about twenty people, protecting the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And actually, that's how I was not initially shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The — we did, however, at the end — when the, when the Nazis finally caught up with us — we were all lined up, as everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And you had most of the people marching in, in one direction, and maybe a few hundred people being saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we were in that group to The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established in April 1941. ; </span><span class="sentence" id="92">This event, which constituted the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , took place from August 20 to August 24, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">end up in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> sort of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> , also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I'm compressing all of this a great deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  It's okay, we have time, we have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Can you tell us about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Well, that was basically — when you, when you think of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as a substantial section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> was basically one <span class="DLF">street</span> that was surrounded with barbed wire and, and other — or maybe two <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And most of the people worked — were taken out from there to work in various, various jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I was there with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And matter of fact, my mother had saved two other children from the—whose, whose parents had — were shipped out in, in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Two children had been left, and she took them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So we ended up then in, in one-half <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I think, with, with two other children yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And — but life still, put it — given what was to follow, was still more or less livable, but very — under very difficult circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Here the killing increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Every so often, or anybody tried to escape, there would be executions and beatings and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The, the worst thing that happened in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was towards the end, when the — when — I think it was in, in '43, or the beginning of '44 — and I'm — my dates are wrong — when there was another Selektion’. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Basically, you know, when people were shipped off to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">What happened there was that all the — they lined us up on a sort of like a <span class="DLF">playground</span> , and separated all the children, and that became the, the famous massacre of the children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was the only one to survive — at least of the group that was, was visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Two other children saved themselves by hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the children were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But what happened there was that the, the children who were taken out, ended up — were taken to a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and killed with hand grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> ; I, I survived that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">That was the worst part in that, that episode.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  How did you survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Very curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They had us lined up on the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The German, the commander of the, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> was standing in the middle making the decision who was going to live and who was going to die, and they pulled tried to pull me out, and my mother and father more or less pulled the other direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And finally, they — my mother, my father and I deci — went up to the German commander; and I said, in German, that I — to let me live, because I could work. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I, I think what, what I saw happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> a number of times was that they were somehow shocked to find that somebody looked very much like their own children, who spoke the same language the way their own children would speak, was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They had — I think they believed a lot of their own propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And he looked at me and ; Nazi term for the selection of prisoners for transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">said in German, "Well, let's see," and let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The whole thing may have lasted two seconds. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And that's how I stayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What happened to you after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Well, after that we ended up in, in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , in — still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The surviving people in this group — I think about two hundred — were split up, half taken to one <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , another half to another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My parents and I ended up in a, in a — and, incidentally, the two children who were younger than I that we had then died in that also. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We, we ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they were making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> for — wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> — for their <span class="REGION">Eastern Front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">At that point I had a very interesting job and assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The feeling was that, that to survive there, it was important to have something to do; and, and I wasn't even 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So I went to the commander, commander of the German — of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> and told him, asked him whether he needed an errand boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And he looked at me, and he said, "Fine." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And so basically, my, my job in that, in that camp consisted of sitting outside his <span class="DLF">door</span> and doing chores that he needed to have done, like getting his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> or taking something to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The, the job had great advantages because I could hear what was going on and could report back, and I could also alert people to his coming because I would be going ahead of him, running, announcing his coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And so we had the signal that I would signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He had — he wore a hat with a feather; and if I went like this to people [gesturing], then he was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And — because if people were seen not working, they would be beaten very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">One interesting episode in that connection is that I could listen to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He would listen to the radio, and I would sit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and I could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I heard the, the capture of Mussolini,” reported it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Of course, nobody believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We had no access to radio or any news. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But that was — and the fact that I worked there actually enabled us to have some food, and my father and mother both worked in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But it was one way of, of surviving, and giving me a cer — certain amount of protection, as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Did things change at some point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, what changed at, at some point was that in 1944 the decision was made, I guess, to ship everybody in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And we were, we were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">What was that like? ' </span><span class="sentence" id="153">In September 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">° In early August 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  We were in, in open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> —put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Interestingly enough, the Germans—we, we, of course, everybody was worried; and I remember people asking, "Where are we going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="157">and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The Germans told us we were being shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And we once — one believes what one wants to believe, and I suppose for a while we thought that's where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Again, I remember my father saying initially that the direction of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then suddenly it, 1t changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And that's when he knew that we were, we were going to someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And he knew then we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Some people jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The way those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were set up, the, the Germans had machine guns at the end of the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and if anybody jumped out, they would just try to kill the people, and I think a number of people jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the way to — and I don't know, know whether they were, were hit or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The, the most memorable thing was to arrive in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was, you know, from a child's perspective, it was just like having driven into an <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> , with people walking back and forth, doing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We, we saw a group carrying bricks from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another and carrying them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And we, we expected to be met by machine guns, so we had no idea what the, the arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> — apart from, from this total view of people in these <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> — those prison garb carrying, running different ways, with Kapos” with sticks. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Was, was a certain calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We were, we were lined up and told we were going to go to, to a laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Had our hair shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">At that point, we expected that things would happen as in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , where we would be immediately executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">What happened was that since our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> since our transfer came from these two <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , 1t was assumed that everybody there was capable of working. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And there was no Selektion. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That's really the way I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I would never have — as a child, would never have gotten in because they would have selected me right out, at my age, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But there was no Selektion. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We actually went through the, the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> — and I mean that they shaved our hair, disinfected us, and eventually, tattooed us; but I don't think right at the, at the arrival and sent us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And we ended up — this is, of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> — ended up in what used to be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gypsy camp</span> , and was still known as the Zigeunerlager, the, the "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gypsy camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="181">That's how I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Describe where you were taken and what you did, what the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was like where you lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were very much like the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> you see in pictures that one sees. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">These big three story <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , very broad, with about ten people fitting into them — just wooden, wooden boards, very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">The first night on arrival, that was, was probably one of the ° Overseers (German). ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Birkenau section B-IIe. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">worst in, in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who had been collaborators in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> had shipped some people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were beaten very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So this was by people who had — whom they had shipped to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> who in the meantime themselves had become Kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The world never changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But, that was sort of the first, the first night, that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That's, you know, the, the sort of initial thing I remember of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We — there were some people that I. — my father knew, who had been shipped out before. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">There again, my father and some friends thought that the way for me to survive was to try to find something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I went — or rather, I don't know who went. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But at any rate, I managed to get to be the errand boy for the Kapo in the, in the laundry and sau — I don't know what they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">A <span class="NPIP">place</span> where people... The <span class="INT_SPACE">wash rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And that, again I think, helped because I, I had a certain protection by being there and also knowing when the Selektion process was going to, to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Because you could — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the Selektion of people, the Selektion out to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> would usually happen every six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The Germans, with their efficiency, would never repeat things immediately or do things irregularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So, you could expect things to happen every four to six weeks, and it usually happened with certain people arriving in the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And if you knew that was going to happen and if you were where I was, it gave you a certain amount of protection because you could hide and get out of, out of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And that certainly helped me, in some instances, to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  Can you tell me what working in a laundry consisted of? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I mean, you survived this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">What did you do there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  One of the things that I had to do was to go and fetch gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Not very often, but I think two or three times — the same gas that was used for the gassing of people — this Zyklon C gas” — to pick it up, for disinfecting purposes, from the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> to the, to the laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And that was, and that actually enabled me to go to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But basically, just go deliver a piece of paper from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, and hang around. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I certainly didn't work very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It wasn't, 1t wasn't a full-time job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  In carrying the gas, did you know that it was the same kind of gas? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Did you make a connection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You, you couldn't, you couldn't live in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> without knowing what the gas was for. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You have to visualize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">In the, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gypsy camp</span> — that is to say, in the —each — there were a number of camps in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They were basically <span class="DLF">streets</span> with <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on each side surrounded by barbed wire, and there was <span class="DLF">Camp D</span> and C and B, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The, the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span> were at one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">You could stand, for example, outside your <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and see the smoke billowing out from the, from . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Zyklon B. the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And not only the smoke, and even almost fire, but also the stench that would come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So you couldn't be in any <span class="NPIP">place</span> in that environment and not know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And, of course, 1t was close enough almost to hear the screaming of, of people ‘cause what happened usually, unlike in my case, people would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , at the — would be unloaded and there separated — one group going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> being allowed to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the others going directly to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and the, and the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Did you watch this often? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Were you in a position to see this process?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  You —I could see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">To say that I watched it... You, you couldn't help but know what was going, going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And as a matter of fact, towards the end, when I was — at the very end, when the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> no longer functioned, we were struck at one point that that suddenly there were birds and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">There, there was nothing before. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It was really sort of a, a cloud hanging over the over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I was at one point, I was — later on — sort of taking the story forward — I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was even closer to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> , where you could really hear the screaming almost on a...on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">You were with your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">What happened to your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  When we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , my father and I were separated from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">My mother was sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and my father and I were sent together to the, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gypsy camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I saw my mother once during that, that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I was able — I was sent on some — or had to go for something to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> ; and went just so I could, could see my mother, and we had — there were systems in which you could get some messages through from one group to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But otherwise there were just my, my father and I. We were, we were separated, I think, in October of 1944 or, or later — when there was another, when there was a Selektion. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And that was the only time when I wasn't able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I — there were many instances where I avoided the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> throughout that period of stay in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; but that was the only time when, when I lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I'd always taken this as sort of a battle between them and us. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And I'd always won; because I was never caught up in any Selektion. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I was always able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But in the last one, my, my father and I, we — there was a Selektion of people to be sent out to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for work purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And Mengele’ and a group of, of doctors were lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And they saw me as a child, and they motioned me to go one way, and my father go the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And that's the last I saw of my, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I was retained in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , where we were supposed to then be taken from there to the, to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I knew that you ° Josef Mengele (1911-1979?), </span><span class="sentence" id="254">extermination camp doctor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">couldn't — you develop all kinds of expertise as a, as a child growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I tried to escape a number of times — couldn't, was caught, was beaten and gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">At that point, I figured there was, there was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I'd tried my best, but it was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">What saved me was the fact that there weren't enough people to take to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They made a decision to take us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick ward</span> , instead, until they had a larger transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And that's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They took us to, to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> closer to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ,'” where all of the people had this serious skin disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It was — 1n, in German it was called "Kratze''." </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I don't know what it is in English, and I didn't develop it. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There was a young Polish doctor, who kept giving me alcohol and other things, and told me what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">One morning, I, I woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I — it was very difficult in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sort of separate nightmares from reality, because you heard the noises all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">One morning, I woke up and the people I had come with were all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And what had happened was that the Polish doctor had torn up card with my name on it, which had a "X" in back, which meant that I was supposed to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">All the other people were taken out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , and I — he had written a new card for me, and I was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And so...From there, then, I went — was able to get out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> with the help, curiously enough, of a German—to, to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> back in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  How did a German help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  I saw a German, and I approached him in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Told him that I wasn't sick, I shouldn't be here, and I was afraid if I stayed here I would catch something — couldn't he help me get out? </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> the D Lager’ — which was, which was sort of the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And there was actually there were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that sort of <span class="BUILDING">children's barracks</span> kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I think all of them were older than, than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I, I was about ten at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">There was a, a Kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Not really a Kapo, but it was what is known as a Blockiiltester'’ — the head of the, of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , who had actually sort of indi — protected the children, saying that they could work. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And he had a whole group of, of young kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">TECHNICAL PROBLEMS - LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  We were in Lager D. 0 Birkenau section B-IIf. " </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Scabies (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="285">2 Birkenau section B-IId. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">8 “Block elder’: The head of a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> row in the slave-labor and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , who was almost always a non-Jewish criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  We were in Lager D, with a, with a group of, of children, and I really don't remember what we did there very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But it — that the treatment on the whole, given how bad it had been in various other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , was not, not all that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We — there were two of us — three of us — who became friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And we had to do all kinds of chores. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I remember once we, we broke into the <span class="INT_SPACE">SS kitchen</span> and I drank my first glass of milk in a, in a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">If they had caught us, I suppose they would have beaten us to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We did those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We had to, I think what I remember we had to pick up garbage, and engage in those activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But then that really didn't last very long because, in Janu — by January, the liquidation of, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They lined us all up. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They came in to announce that the ca — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was being liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Lined us up, gave us some food, and began to march us out of, out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And that started the famous death march out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We were marched first for about three days, to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gliwice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The, the, the three of us kids were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The kids were put—the, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children's camp</span> group was put in front when we first marched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But it was — Polish January is cold, and we didn't — we carried blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">But after about a 10, 12-hour walk that we began to, to be very tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The children began to, to fall back. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">People from the back were pushing, that we weren't going fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And whoever sat down was, was shot, within, within our view, by the guards who were on each side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The three of us developed a system of resting which was to run up to the front, and then sort of stop almost, until we reached the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And by that time, we had, we had rested, and then we could run up again and we would stay warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And I don't know how long we did this, but at — suddenly in the evening there was — they stopped the column and asked for all the children to, to come forward, that they were going to be put in a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and they didn't have to march anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Well, we had had experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And we didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And all the children from that group then were, were taken away and apparently shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So we were the only three that, that stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We — and it wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">There were all kinds of—we, we carried bread, and people kept pushing to get the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And everybody had a slice of bread, food, clothes, blankets; and we, we couldn't carry them. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">After a while, we didn't have anything any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">After three days, we, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gliwice</span> , where they did another Selektion out. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But the three of us managed to, to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The, the test was whether you could run across some square, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And we together held each other up, and, and made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">That's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gliwice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which took I think twelve days or so to get to the destination — my destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped at another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> — which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> — where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I suppose what is noteworthy about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride: again open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , January 1945, Polish winters. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was packed with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You couldn't breathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And if you were small, as, as we were, it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">By the time we arrived, you could walk in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">People died in tremendous numbers of exposure, of hunger, everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And whenever somebody died, they were thrown overboard as the as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I think, in my, in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> alone there were no more than about ten people or so, when we when we arrived for the first time at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There you might have an interesting footnote to that experience: in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , when we arrived, I heard a German woman say, "Es stinkt so wieder nach Juden" — which means, "It smells again of Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">At the same time, a, a German — our German guard, who was sitting on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> — gave me a cup of coffee, which was the first warm thing I, I had had on this entire trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We — well, the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> eventually ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heinkel</span> — where there's a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> , where we were kept for about two weeks, I, I think.” </span><span class="sentence" id="337">By that time, I — the cold was so bad I, I lost some — my, my legs were totally frostbitten, my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Eventually, the toes, some toes had to be amputated. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heinkel</span> , I remember taking off my shoes and never found my shoes again. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They were, they were good shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We were there and nothing much happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Then after two weeks, we were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> — which was a German Musterlager, which had been there already in the in the '30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And was a— you came in, there was a big sign saying "Arbeit Macht das Leben Siiss" — all of which, which is, "Work Makes Life Sweet." </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We were put in, in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there, after actually marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And it was very difficult at that point for me to, to walk from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heinkel</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">German kids were throwing stones at the group that was, that was marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It was almost a relief to end up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I don't know how long I was there before I couldn't anymore, with my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">My toes had turned totally black. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And the, the — 1t wasn't pain; but the nerves were — I just, I couldn't sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I, I could feel everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I then went to — they had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And because it was a model <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was actually a well set-up <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="356">And before I knew it, four people grabbed, stretched me out on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and operated right there on the <span

was a French military doctor, who was very good and very kind, and actually saved my leg, because gangrene would have set in. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was black. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He saved my other foot — I didn't loose any, any toes on, on my other foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">My, my hands were, were fine. </span><span class="sentence"

<span class="INT_SPACE">hospital ward</span> for about four to six weeks; and was, was helped a lot by, by Norwegians, and others, who so saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">The

<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  Tell me, if you would, about your stay in that <span class="INT_SPACE">hospital ward</span> and your meetings with the Norwegians. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">What — first, what was the <span class="BUILDING">ward</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Oh, just a big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> where people — some were dying, some had...had minor injuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">A lot of people -different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Every so often, people would be taken out, people would be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The Selektion was made of people who were actually taken out and, and killed, without most of us knowing what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They were called out. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The Norwegians received packages from the Norwegian Red Cross, or the Swedish Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And befriended me and helped me immensely, with — especially a man by the name of Fridtjof Nan — Odd Nansen — the son of Fridtjof Nansen’’ who was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — helped me with — both with food, and also I think with giving food to the people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> to, to protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">The, the one thing that I remember from that <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> is something which we — which people who haven't been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> don't realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">That when all of this terrible tragedy and terrible conditions that were going on, people still had a great sense of humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It, it didn't leave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Let me give you one example: in this <span class="INT_SPACE">hospital ward</span> , we had as a ventilator just a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , which was plugged up with a piece of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="382"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , as I said, was about twenty kilometers outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And when the Allies bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would fly over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">There's another story to this, which I can tell you later. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But at any rate, the bombing, of course, the bombs would fall pretty close. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And one day, there, there was a very severe bombing attack, and people were getting out of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> because of the fear that the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> would be bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And, and there it was all wood and would have been burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And suddenly there was a tremendous crash of a bomb falling, and a man screaming he's been killed by the bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But what had happened was that the piece of wood that had plugged up the ventilator had fallen down, and just fallen on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And, you know — despite this environment we were in — that whole block of people, maybe a hundred dying people, burst into a roar of laughter which I still remember to this day — about the fact that this poor man thought he had died already. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">There were many instances of that going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">The other thing which, in which we took great pride and joy was that when the bombing raids came, the, the German officers' families and influential Germans would hide in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from the bombing attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Because the bo — the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was known to the Allies; and they avoided bombing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">As a matter of fact, at night they would drop flares around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in order not to bomb it. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And so it was really the safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And that, to us, we were beginning to feel that the war, that we were maybe winning.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , you tell me that you were befriended by Norwegians — particularly Odd Nansen. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Can you tell me something about him, and about your relationship with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Well, he, he would come and visit various Norwegians 1n the, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; and that's how we, we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He, he was writing a diary in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I, of course, didn't know about it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I found out after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So he, he came by, talked to a lot of people; and then, when he found out that I was there and that I'd come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he befriended me. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And came and visited me almost every week, or maybe even more often and would bring me cookies and try and make sure that I was all nght. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And brought me ex — as a matter of fact, brought me paper and a pencil to draw. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And what, of course, I didn't know was that he wrote down a lot of things about my experiences at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He was a wonderful man, who had — really a great humanitarian; very much in the tradition of his father, who was Fridtjof Nansen — the High Commissioner for Refugees during the League of Nations time, after whom the, the Nansen Passport is named. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But he, he helped me immensely. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I, I think he, he saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">He was then shipped out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> shortly before the, the end of the war, when Count Bernadotte'’ was able to get the Norwegians and Danes out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and get them to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">At that point we, we didn't see each other again. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And after the war, when having survived I, I tried to, to find him, couldn't remember his name — only knew that he, that he had a very famous Norwegian name. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But wanted to find him and wanted to thank him. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I didn't find him until about 1947 or '48, when my mother read in the newspaper that a book had been published. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It was a diary of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that, among other things dealt with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And that it was a Norwegian who had published it. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">At that point, we, we wrote to him, asking whether he knew that, who that Norwegian might be who helped me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And, of course, it was he. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">There's a great story to this because I — mail, of course, was very slow 1n those days, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Food was very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We didn't hear from him for — we didn't receive an answer to the letter for about four or six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And one day, there's a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> — and up pulled a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Norwegian military truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And the soldier came out, and asked whether this was our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And we said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And he said he had a little package for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And so we said, "Well, give it to us." </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And he said, "No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It's, — we need to carry it." </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And they — then a group of Norwegian soldiers jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and brought this tremendous crate — wooden crate — of food that had been collected by Norwegian children, with a letter from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And shortly thereafter, he came and actually took me to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And — because he had thought that I had died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And the book, in fact, that he published about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — the diary — was dedicated to me, among other people, on the assumption that I hadn't survived the — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So it was a wonderful reunion when we when we finally got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">7 Folke Bernadotte (1895-1948);

QUESTION:  Okay, let's go back to you in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">When were you released from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  I really wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> the Germans lost the war before I was released from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , or rather, they had to leave the, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Again, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was to be liquidated, and people were lined up to march out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We, we really couldn't walk, and the people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hospital ward</span> were left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And we assumed that they would come in and shoot everybody in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and it was extremely — I remember the day when people lined up, and then it became extremely quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And you couldn't hear anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">You only — and we waited, basically, on the assumption that any minute now they would, they would come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And of all the people in that, in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I probably could move better. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">By then, I had a crutch;
