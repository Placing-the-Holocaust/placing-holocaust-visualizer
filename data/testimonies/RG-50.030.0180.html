class="sentence" id="380">And we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And that time they send that brother...the brother didn't want to know where they will send him. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The sent him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I wrote about this in the... will not repeat this. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They sent him back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I wrote in the diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I have everything written down. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And then in awhile, they sent him also away from over there to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And he was about 2 months he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> working, and we were working other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">From the 220,000 Jews was left by the end only 2,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It was going transports every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We were beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We were...we were always by the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">One time the , he...he hit only girls...girls, not boys, only girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And one time I was packed with things to take out to change for...for food, and I heard the is over there, so I went back quick to throw down...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to throw down the things because I knew he 1s...the...is very strict over there....to throw down. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He...Well, he says, Where you go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I told, "To my group. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Here is my group." </span><span class="sentence" id="398">He gave me with the...with the whip over the...over the face and...and...and he said, "Stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Stay here with your sister." </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So we stand...and we knew we will get 25 because he gave 25 and in Europe nobody was wearing pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">No girl was wearing pants, only skirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And he picks up the skirts and on the...on the...on the silky panties he gives 25 with the whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">When he gave me the 25 I went to him and begged him not to hit my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">She is only 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">She will not be able to take it, the 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I was biting my...my lips not to scream, not to give him the satisfaction when he was hitting me, but then I went to him and I kissed his hand and I begged him, "Hit me once more and don't hit my sister." </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But they kept me by the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and they started to hit my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Then I was screaming to get off my sister, but my sister didn't get 25 because every whip she was so young, a child 14 years, every whip was with blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So he gave her...and she...she told me just last week, she had only six. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I didn't know how many, but..but she had only six times. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But we couldn't sit a long time later. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And she...she was laying always, when she went in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , she was laying on the...on the belly. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But the next day, we had to go...we had to go off anyway to work, so we went to work every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And by the work we were hit too. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">One time a hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Good I had a coat because it was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So he hit me with his cane, so he broke on me the cane in few...in few pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And...and then he called me to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he says, "Tomorrow you will have to bring me other cane because I broke the cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">If not I will...I will kill you tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So the whole...when I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was looking the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and the...for a cane to bring me the cane and... because...and they brought me about 10 canes. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So beautiful, some of them were silver things what the people left what they were sent away..to give him and I gave him the whole thing...10 canes because he broke on me the cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Such things! </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They degraded us so, I was not caring anymore, but I promised my mother that I will take care the rest of my family so I...I didn't care to be killed already. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Then... then my brother, my last brother, was sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And this brother...and this brother what I saved his life, he came one time <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he says, "Mina, I heard... heard that they will go to...to liquidate woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I will not let myself anymore tear apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We are enough teared apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We will run away, but I have to look for you for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> because with girls I can't run without a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So he went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">He took 2 weeks til he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I was thinking they killed him already because he took off the band and everything and he went to look for a...he with his boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They were both <span class="BUILDING">Yeshivas</span> ... Yeshiva boys, but in this time, they didn't wear already the , nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">They went and they found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> so we...we took...we... the day what we had to go away to...we were to meet <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , uh..outside ""<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jawiszowice</span> , we told him one this <span class="NPIP">place</span> we will meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So we stood first my sister from the...from the...when we went from work, then I, and my brother from other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we met over there...uh...in...1n this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we told we will meet and we went night time over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">This was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tyczyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">This means <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tyczyn</span> was our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and where they found the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but it was...by our...more walking distance from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jawiszowice</span> , about 3 hours walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They found it a <span class="NPIP">place</span> by a...by a goy what he five children and they were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And this time wasn't...wasn't law that if somebody keeps Jews, they get killed together with the Jews, but we promised him to give him every month nice money. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They made with him arrangements and for the food what he will give us, they...uh...knew he will pay him whatever he spends. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So we...uh...but they were in the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the 2 boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We were in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but they were waiting til they will make for us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They made for us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They made for us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> to go down on a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">How they were working, you can't imagine to take out so much ground from over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">The...the...uh...the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but the walking in was to the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> what we couldn't...uh...uh...walk straight only put down, and they made a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> over there to be able to sit a whole day and for night time when the children will go to sleep, they will let us out to the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> was...I wrote about this too a poem and in the diary too...and my brother and this boy were an hour walking distance through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">When they...they had the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">When they came to visit us once a month I told them don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">You can be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He says Germans are not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And we go only when it is not the moonlight. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">It is...when it is the dark light we go through the...nobody will find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They came to us three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">The third time they were caught by the Poles, by 19 Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And they beat them up so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">My brother, they cut...they cut the throat, but they didn't kill him... only little he was cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And the beat him so up that he will black blue old...old. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I know they caught him only 5 minutes from us...not 5 minutes...5 minutes from us they started to chase them the two boys, but they run in the opposite way because they didn't want bring them to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> so they were caught only...only 10 minutes from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The boy, the boyfriend of...of my...of my brother, he...he'll...they...they throwed out his eye...his eye was hanging over the face and they were chained to take to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And the Gestapo they...later I found out, that on the Gestapo, the Poles, the 19 Poles, told that they have some <span class="NPIP">place</span> two sisters because they knew us because they came to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from the <span

token...take to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">To tell you about the...the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , we didn't have air to. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It was lack of oxygen. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We had a carbide lamp, but a little light over there couldn't light nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Not...not a candle, because it was not oxygen enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Only the carbide. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They goy what he kept us. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They are such anti-semitic goy, but they were very religion goys. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They...they...uh...they said they charged us so much money and they gave us so little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And my sister one time she...she got fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Two weeks she couldn't recognize me even. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">She was talking from the fever and we were under the ground in this...1n this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and from night time we went down up to the <span

id="479">When the children went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and they will not know that we are over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He was...was so awful to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">this goy. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He was starving us, and he was telling us, "You ate enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">When I came to your <span

little bit starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">You will be humans. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">We knew that he can kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Nobody will know even. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So we told him because he was a very religion Christian, we told him that after the war we will change to Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And we were thinking future Christians he will not kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">He is a religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They went every Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">They went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Once a month he went to...to confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">But the confession in teaching the...the...the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> wasn't teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The...the priest wasn't teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He told them he has two...two...two girls, Jewish girls that he asked who are they. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Glucksman. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They will convert to...because we were Glucksman from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They will convert to Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He knew that my father's daughters will never change to Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So he told him so. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">When you make a crime, you will be forgiven. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But if you five innocent plans will go from this world, you will be always in Hell burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We didn't know what he told him, but when he came from this confession, we saw he is very angry and "Go to . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I don't want you Jews and this and this." </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I told him, "Listen, we didn't come to you with a gun to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We don't have where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="508"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> is already liquidated because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was few...few weeks later when we are run away, <span

class="DLF">grave</span> and the the goy came, this goy came and he said the <span class="DLF">grave</span> 1S moving up and down three days already because it was probably over there Jews already what...what they were still alive there buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And just 4 weeks later, my father's cousin, 32 years old and his wife and children, 3 or 4, this I don't remember, were caught by the...by the Poles to they were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They even didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I didn't know that they didn't go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because it was such a mishmash in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Who...who...only the nearest family, you knew where they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And this was my father's cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So, they...they caught him. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">They hit him and the little girl said to the mother...she was 8 years old...because they got married very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So she says to the

<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">You can go back to the story now. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You said...you were saying you thought you would go out to be killed with your brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  When he was...they were taken to death, I knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It is now on? </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I knew everything what is going on because they came every minute to tell us what 1s going on with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And...and we want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">My sister says. "</span><span class="sentence" id="534">Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Let's go and be killed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Anyway we will not live. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Let's be killed together with them." </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So I told her, "Sabina", You know what they will do us? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We are girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">They will rape us and they will...and they will dirty us up and then they will take us to the...to the Germans to be killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="541">But we were going out from our minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I was thinking something we have to do to occupy...the whole time when we were over there, I taught her everything what I remembered because she had only 6...6 <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> finish, and then she couldn't go anymore because the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">She was 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So I taught her everything by memory what I remember...what I remembered and I tell her stories and I told her...I make up stories to tell her to occupy her. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">She was sick 2 weeks and she didn't...couldn't...she couldn't recognize me and I couldn't even take a doctor...nothing... because we were...so [...like here, it's aspirin. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Over there, 1t was other name of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I sent him for the aspirin, and I begged him, "Make something warm for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Something because they cooked for us potatoes, and they gave us for a whole day over there to the whole over there the potatoes and...uh...and...uh...she couldn't swallow this. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">She was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So one time I went...when we were up in the..in the...so I was thinking I have to... meat...we didn't have the whole time...they were starving us. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We paid much money, and they were starving us. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So I told her, "Sabina, I have something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Something to give you." </span><span class="sentence" id="554">She said, "I can't swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I can't swallow the potatoes." </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And I was think she will die over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I went upstairs and they were chickens and chickens...little chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So I was thinking, I will kill one chick. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">One chick for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So I...I...J never killed nothing in my life, so I took a stone and I...and I hit the chicken over the head and I killed the chicken and I went in the...in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and I over there, I made from...from tooth no...uh...polish...polish...shoe polish, from...from the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , I made with a virus...and I cleaned up the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> ..the chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I cleaned up the chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I cleaned up the bones and I buried over there inside in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and over there we had always wore it sometimes dripped from the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">It dripped from this, so we had always wore this. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So I cleaned this up, and I cut up little pieces and I put over ... I put little pieces in little water. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It was so hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Don't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I made this for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Then she started to fight with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">If you will not eat, I will not eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So I told her, Sabina, I ate..I ate the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I couldn't tell her that I wouldn't be able to take this in my mouth because I killed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It was...my hands and feet were shaking when I killed this chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So...but I had to save her life somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So I made her the whole chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I cut up in little pieces and I made it over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carbide lamp</span> so to give her something. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And...uh...this and one time...one time, she passed out because we didn't have air to breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Sometimes we had "hair black, hair black even from lack of oxygen so I saw she is passing out because when he..when he...when we went to the..uh...to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , it was a little thing to pull through, a little <span class="DLF">opening</span> , and he put on this dirt on a little dirt and then a big stone and I saw that she will pass out when I don't get some air in. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So I went...I went...I went on the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I couldn't pick up my hand because it was very narrow to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I went on the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and with my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I don't know how I did...the stone was maybe by | <span class="DLF">yard</span> big and by a half <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">How I did this I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I don't know til now. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">When...when...in..uh.. I pulled off the stone and I came for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I dragged her over the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , up to the and I closed quick the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the...from the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> because there were laying children around back and forth in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And I dragged her up to get some <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">She came to herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And he came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">He saw the <span class="DLF">door</span> is closed so he knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And he saw us. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">How you went out? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Who helped you to take off the stone? </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So I told him, "Jesus helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Don't you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Jesus helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">He...he was sorry we didn't have with what to breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">He was sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">He told us go out." </span><span class="sentence" id="600">This was such a primitive goy. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He believed in this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">He believed that it is impossible a human-being should be able to pick this up alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So he..he..uh...he was very dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He didn't know how to write and read. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">When he came from this concentration, I saw that this taught him something and this also small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">He knew my father and Saturday he went with that with the <span class="DLF">garden</span> with the to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with beard and . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">He knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">He saw him going to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So...so he knew that his daughter will never...that we fool him only. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So he told him this, but he didn't tell me what he told the...I knew that something he felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And understanding that, you see, understanding that the Russians went back and forth with 6 months to fight, so back and forth they moved back, and they started to come nearer. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And when they started to come nearer, he started to be good with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So I told...and I knew it was coming the second time the...soon he will go to other confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">It is almost...almost a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So I told him, "Tell me the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">What priest told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I know you came very hungry from the priest, from the confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He told me what I want and he didn't make up these words because he wouldn't know how to compare his children to five innocent plants. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He wouldn't be able this to...to compare so I knew this not his words. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">He told me...I with my sister looked at us..at each each other and we..we thought...how it is possible he told them to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">He will go the second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">He will see he doesn't understand that crime will be forgiven and you five innocent...uh...will go from this world because of these two Jewish girls, he will be always in <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">He will go second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">He will tell him he will see that he didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So I told him listen I will tell you...he bought us...uh...the...uh...Jesus. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We were waiting this Jesus. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">He bought us this. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We had to pay him for this but we were worrying. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We didn't have a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So he...I told him...Listen go to other priest, to the other confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We will see they are both sons of God...the both...every...every...everyone is a son of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So go...go to other...to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Over there I knew they don't...the priest at least doesn't know my father because it was the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And it was the same direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">He listened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">He went and he brought us back rosaries and books and I...we had to pay for this...and..the...the... priest will come to convert us right now after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Now he can come and God but the..the...right now after the war he will come to convert us. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I didn't believe that we will live until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But after my brother died...after they killed him, I saw that we will go out from our mind so I told myself, we have something...I have something to occupy my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I have something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So I told him to buy copy books. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He bought the copy books and we started to write a diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">That's why I have a diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We were under this ground 20 and a half months, hiding, in terrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I had this in the diary written down. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We had to work too. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Sometimes they gave us work and we had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But we made from our old things what we had hidden..old things, we made from...from...uh...pillow cases for this we made some scarves and I told him that I want dye. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">For what? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I want to make myself some dresses, me and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So he..he says, "Who sees you." </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But we had always, you see, in Europe, you didn't wear cotton dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You wear all silk or wool and when we go down from the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , up and down, it tears the dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">It was delicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So we had to have something from...from cotton. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So...from sheets, we made something so I told him we havse to make myself...ourself, two dresses, cotton dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So I..I...I told him...we sewed this by hand with machine stitches but by hand, so we told him to bring us dye. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So he says, "What you need dye? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Who will see you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But we were like for ourself buy...buy us 10 package this dye. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I gave him money. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">He bought. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So I told, "I don't like this color. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Buy me red." </span><span class="sentence" id="667">He bought me red. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I had put together few...few colors so I started to make for sale because I saw the money will go soon out. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">We didn't have a fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">We have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">We started to make skirts, " skirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">No, the wear to the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , they wear over scarves, brown scarves. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We started to make from "dommers. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It was like a design. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">We started to make scarves to sale. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We started to make all kind of things for him to sale and we...we dyed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Over there in the...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bunker camp</span> because we had enough water over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We sometimes had to take off some buckets of water from over there because it would...it would cover us the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So...so...we...we...we couldn't dry this in this <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">We couldn't dry this in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because it will never dry. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We dried this under us when we went to sleep...under us on the straw with our bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">This was our life for 20 and a half months. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">To tell you the...the...that deaths...how many deaths I saw in the...in the...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in my eyes killed, how they teared out children from the mother's hand and they throwed to the German shepherds, how the... This was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> before... before we went over to . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It was by ten or maybe more in the...in the with little , they were someplace in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They were taken every day to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">We were then working on the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> because the railroad was bombed that we had to put new <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and this boys had to pick up this. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">There were already orphans because parents were already sended away. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">They were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And one fell and the Gestapo kicked him between the feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I went to him and I want to give him my...my lunch what I took with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">He says, "I don't want. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I want my mommy, my daddy." </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And I hurt so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It hurt so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">He kicked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I don't know what they did to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">He couldn't stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">In a while his voice disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Probably sent away or killed, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They were someplace in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">It was a time when they want to <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> us, our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">When we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , my brother's group we ran away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span

</span><span class="sentence" id="707">We run away, and then later we came back because we didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We looked everyday the dead in the eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I can't tell you everything what was going on because it would take til tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But I...I tell you only fragments from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It was a little boy 9 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">In a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> she was 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">They were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">They were working together with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And it was...it was...uh... before we ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It was the...the...one time the little boy worked with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We had to work very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I had to work for my... because my sister was also not so strong. </span><span class="sentence"

me." </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It was such a devotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Everybody would give life for the other person. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And

</span><span class="sentence" id="736">And they say, "Quick work you...they called us awful name...quick work anyway you go from morning late to the...to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I didn't believe that they are putting in the ovens people. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I was thinking the anti*Seminites, they called us" names, such

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russishooner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">You know what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Because he took the trench coat, but because he knew

was big <span class="DLF">wall</span> , but our <span class="DLF">window</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> went out to the <span class="REGION">Irish side</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And...and I saw my brother sitting over there withthis boy, sitting over there, and they say, "What you have to come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I told he had to come here 10 o'clock at night to buy for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So he says, "When they will not come, you will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So we know that you are a liar." </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So I told, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">He will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He told he will buy from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">He went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">He told he will buy from us." </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So...so he says, "Not in this <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Maybe this Jew will buy from you." </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I knew...my brother will come out because he will expect that we are knocking, so" I told, "I don't know this Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">How I knock to this <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I don't know this Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So he knocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I saw my brother through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I saw he is coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So I started to scream Polish to him, "I don't know this Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">What you want from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I don't know this Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So I want my brother to know not to come to the...to hear my voice, that we are in trouble, that he will not come to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> because he will be right now killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So...so he knew already that we are in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">In the meantime, he says, "Oh, you spoiled everything." </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He gave me a slap in face. "</span><span class="sentence" id="778">You spoiled everything because you are screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">He would come here and buy this. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">You are screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">You spoiled everything." </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So..I..I told, "But I don't know this Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And I screamed again for him good to hear not to come to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Then I hearrf, they...we make believe we don't understand German, but I hearded, they told they will take us some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a...in a...in a...a empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they will rape us. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Oh, my God!
