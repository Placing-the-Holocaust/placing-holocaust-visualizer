<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  And your mom was a housekeeper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My mom was a debutante. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother had season tickets at the opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My mother was a dilettante. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">She -- she -- she went to the Cordon Bleu cooking school, couldn't cook a lick. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We -- she -- she enjoyed her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">She was a young -- she was a young woman who enjoyed her life, and made it all the more difficult later on in her life, but -- and I didn't -- I was a spoiled kid and so was my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , if I remember correctly, it was 11 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And our <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> was bigenough that we used to do -- my sister and I would race our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tricycles</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There was enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to make turns. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was that big. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So you -- you know, those -- the big trouble when you're five and six years old, you don't remember -- you remember pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And riding my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> is more important than where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what I had to eat, you know, and those are things I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Can you describe your family as being religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What's interesting -- my father was the son of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ichivibulha</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="45">You know, he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he was like tevea (ph) without the milk route. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He was -- he was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village hebruscala</span> (ph) basically, but, you know, you can't live on the chicken somebody brings you for advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So his wife kept what would be now called the <span class="BUILDING">7-Eleven</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">She had the <span class="BUILDING">local store</span> , and people would come there, and he would sit there and give out advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I never knew either one because I'm named after my grandfather and -- but they were smart enough that he was the oldest of six kids, and she said, Go to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Get a business degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Make enough money. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Bring your brother out. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">When you bring your brother out, he goes to <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> , gets a business degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Bring your other brother out and then your sister, and they all got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They all went out and they kept ties with the -- my grandfather and my -- my grandmother died of natural causes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I mean, that was way before -- before the Nazis, but nobody was religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But my dad could only pray orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I mean, we would -- when -- this was when I was conservative leaning toward reformed, but in -- we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They had all three <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> , the Jewish and the Jaxonites (ph), and he would go downstairs to the little <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> orthodox, and he would daven only in the -- and passover with him was a disaster because he would go through the entire Haggadah in Hebrew only -- never pausing for one word, and my mother would be say, Joe, the dinner's getting cold, but we weren't religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  And what was the name of your sister and your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  My sister's name was Lucie, L-u-c-i-e, and my mother's name was Ditta, D-1-t-t-a, which is diminutive for Edith. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Little Edith. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But her name on her birth certificate was Ditta, and my grandfather and his -- they came out of -- they came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and they were a super family. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They -- my grandfather -- I have pictures of him flying to visit his <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in 1929, pictures standing in front of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , airline flying to <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and they -- my grandmother's family -- they -- Peter Bogdanovich, the movie director, 1s part of my mother's -- my grandmother's family on my mother's side and -- and her sister was the first pharmacist in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , you know, so they were -- they were an achieving upper-class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And they're very, very -- I love my -- my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They were classy people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Did you or your sister go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  My -- well, I was small but my sister went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Was it a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  -- <span class="BUILDING">older nation school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">A: Politely put, even then we were in a simulated family. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There was, you know -- the -- my -- my dad had Jewish friends and so on, but it -- the Jewish Society was Jewish Society, but I was never aware that I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You know, we -- during the holidays and Passover, Yom Kippur, yeah, we did celebrate that, but usually at my grandparent's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Were you or your parents aware of Nazi --
ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  -- rise and what -- what was their first --
ANSWER:  Once again -- once again, I'm thinking as a five-year-old, but I remember when Dollfuss was assassinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Dollfuss was a socialist minister who was against the Anschluss. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And one day he was shot at a -- shot at a <span class="REGION">valley</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> came through and said, We'll take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And they loaded him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They found him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> two days later dead when it was sun up. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And it was politically very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My father, I know for a fact about six or seven months before the Anschluss, one of his employees came in and he said, Mr. Halpern, I am a member of the Austrian Nazi Parties, National Socialist Party, and eventually, you know, it's just a matter of time before we come here and we need friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">No Jewish questioned at all but we need friends and we need -- and so it's how about a contribution now, and my father had him thrown out, fired him and threw him out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Did he mean, like, money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Donation to the party to show good-will toward the party and when right after the Anschluss, my dad came to work one day and he was sitting in his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and hesaid, You work for me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And for a while my dad -- my dad did -- my dad did go -- one of the good -- and then you know we -- we had a nanny, and we -- we used to go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and then we couldn't go into the <span class="DLF">park</span> so -- the nanny was Catholic and we would walk around the <span class="DLF">park</span> , and then we had to wear arm bands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  And my nanny -- I was upset that my nanny didn't wear one because, oh, you know, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">You can't have one of these arm bands, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">If you were Jewish you could wear one of these things, you know, and that summer we still went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We still went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I remember it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">vegetarian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I came down with appendicitis. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Could not find a doctor in the -- in the <span class="REGION">area</span> to treat me. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So with a case of appendicitis, I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and they wouldn't take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- I know that from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And then my appendix was taken out by a Jewish doctor in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You know, and he had kind of an <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> , and that was the first time I suddenly realized that something was a little bit wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And my sister had to change <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">She couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and -- but we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where -- mostly Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I -- I can't tell you, but I know -- I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And in the fall of '38, our nanny was not allowed to work for us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So now my debutante mother had to take us for walks and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And my sister was at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my mother said to me, Let's go for a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And she looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She said, Your shoe lace is untied. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So she literally stood me up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">She was 4'11. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">She stood me up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> so she could tie my shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I'm standing there, she's tying my shoe, and the doorbell rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And twogentlemen come in, and it was right out of a -- right out of a German movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">These two guys came in, and they had rain coats and snap-brim hats and the whole bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And they said is -- is your husband here? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And my mother said, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He's -- and my mother was one of these very nervous people. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And she said, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He's not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They said, We need to look around. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And my mother said, Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And so they walked in -- and I'm five years old and I'm toddling behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I'm -- and they went into my father's study which was I remember it because it had green shades you know, in the old days instead of white shades there was a green shade. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So the sunlight was always filtered and I remember distinctly one of them walking to my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , reaching into his coat, taking out his gun, and laying it on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> under my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And then the other one went over and said, Oh, what's this? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And he picked the gun up and he turned to my -- went to my mother and said, Is this yours? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And my mother said, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And he said, Well, you're going to have to come with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And she said, Well, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He said, Well, do you have somebody who can take care of him? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And so my mother went up and got one of the -- one of the neighbors to take care of me 'till my grandmother could come and collect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And that the last time I saw my mother and father 'till spring of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And they went to the <span class="BUILDING">downtown Vienna prison</span> , and I understand for the two years they were in the <span class="BUILDING">downtown Vienna prison</span> they saw each other one time in the <span class="DLF">exercise yard</span> and never talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But you have to understand here is a woman who has had the best of everything and she's living in a <span class="INT_SPACE">wing</span> with 200 women, one <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , no <span class="DLF">doors</span> ; one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , no <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But through this entire time, my former nanny used to come and collect her laundry and do her laundry for her, you know, what little rags she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And she -- it was just kind ofdifferent, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So we -- we went to -- we went to my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that's -- if you're going to record this, this is -- my grandfather, right after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the troops were in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , went on a normal business trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And about three days later, my mother got -- my grandmother got a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And the letter said, By the time you get this letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I'm on my way to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I am not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They don't want you. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They want me. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So sometime in the next week they will come and say to you, Where's your husband? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And you show them this letter, and they're going to say, When is he coming back? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And you're going to say, He's not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Just show them the letter, and eventually they'll let you go because they don't want you. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Sign over anything they want, give them anything you want -- they want, and they'll let you go -- because this is still early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And that's exactly how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And so, finally, after about by the spring of '39, my grandmother's arranging for us to go into Kindertransport, and they said, Just sign here. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Give us the bill and then sign over and get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And she said, Not until I put my kids -- my grandkids on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they said, No, you have to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She said, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I'm not getting out until they get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">That's how tough she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And she was the only member of my family who was over 5'6, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So she was the queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and she went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ; and she joined her husband who was -- he had guts. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I mean, he played -- he played with people's lives, but he -- he knew human nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He knew that as long as they got what they wanted they were going to -- and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and I remember the -- I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And, you know, a little them -- them memories and I had my father's brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and he had come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with his wife, Auga (ph),as a domestic. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They signed on as a couple, and Auga (ph) came over pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So their son, Ralph, was born in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and was a British subject, and did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He is a Lord of the British Emperor. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">His name is Sir Ralph Halpern, and he was chairman of the board of Burton Industries, and he now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Beach</span> , and my -- my son and he are good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I see them occasionally, and he was always a -- always a Brit and he's always been a Brit. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Calls me Dear Boy and he's six years younger than Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And it's kind of racy, and I -- he and I have a good time together. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And -- and but there was nowhere we could stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- we could stay with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We'd stay a couple of days, and then went down to <span class="BUILDING">Bunce Court</span> and Dan (ph) Court to -- Kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They made an arrangement for the kids who did not have -- weren't going to be taken there by families. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There was -- there were these <span class="DLF">estates</span> out by Kent, and they brought in an educator from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> named Anna Essinger and who was the most magnificent teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I was there 16 months, and I stayed in one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my sister stayed in the other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And I can't tell you whether I was in <span class="BUILDING">Bunce Court</span> or <span class="BUILDING">Dan Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I think I was in <span class="BUILDING">Bunce Court</span> because it comes easier to my mind, but, you know, the memories are strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">All I know is that I did a lot of schooling because I jumped like three years when I came here immediately because they thought I was a poor refugee kid until I -- I told them -- they put me in the second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I could read. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I could do math. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I -- I had a little bit of chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I knew European History because that's what that's what the regimen there was, and the -- they -- the -- the -- the bombings were pretty bad around that <span class="REGION">area</span> because a lot of <span class="BUILDING">fighter bases</span> were in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , and we got sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and -- which is interesting because then the Brits started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And the Brits -- Britains decided to have their own Kindertransport and, they went and signed up 30,000 children to get them first to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and then to the <span

class="sentence" id="188">And it was a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And from what I'd been read -- what I read -- it was part of the government in power at that time, and he said this is a mistake because they have to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And the -- the Germans controlled the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And if we lose one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , when the war is over, we will lose the election because that will be an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And we were supposed to go in December of -- September 10th or 12th we were -- 1940, we were supposed to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> to catch a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and I remember we sat in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> -- in <span class="BUILDING">Victoria Station</span> because the air raids were very bad at that time, and we missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City of Benares</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City of Benares</span> was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ship</span> converted from a Cunard-White Star Line. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City of Benares</span> was sunk a three days later in the -- on its way -- way, and I think 89 children didn't die in the sinking but died of exposure to water. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It was a horrific thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And Churchill immediately cancelled that -- and about 3500 -- there were books on that -- there were more books on that Kindertransport than our Kindertransport because it was a different issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , and four days later we -- we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">SS Antonia</span> which was a converted Cunard-White Star Line, and all I remember is we were the only two kids on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we saw in the <span class="INT_SPACE">crew quarters</span> and my -- and for luck they would play cards with us sitting on their lap. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And we were supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and there was a -- there was a U-boat scare. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , and we arrived in September 30th, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And I got to see my first comics, and I can still remember the -- you know, Americans comics was something usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And I -- I can tell you thestory. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">It was a Dick Tracy story, and I can do that when I get a smart -- I always -- I've always been trying to get the copy of that -- that particular page from September 30th so I could show -- and my grandfather -- my grandfather had us picked up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We got put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and the first day we were in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , we went and applied for first citizen -- first papers because as far as everyone knew, my parents were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So my grandfather was my guardian. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And we applied for first papers for -- for declaration, not to -- to get out of refugee status. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> with my -- with my grandmother, and my sister went to my grandfather's brother who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kingston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He was also quite wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And it was a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And I -- and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> and I went to PS3, and they -- a week after my teacher called my grandmother and said, He's seven and a half years old and he doesn't belong in the second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We're going to put him in the third grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So I finished that year, and they said, We need to put him in the fifth grade next year. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And my -- and my grandmother said, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He's -- he's a smart kid, but he needs -- he needs a little bit of respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He needs to be leveled off a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">He needs to be with his age. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You can put him in the fourth, but you can't put him -- you can't put him in the fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So I was always early because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But my grandmother was very -- very clever about that she said, you know, He needs peer pressure, and he's not going to get it if he's a smart-alecky kid three years over his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And -- and then in his early 1941 my grandfather who was in the -- he owned real estate, <span class="BUILDING">office buildings</span> and <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They invested with -- with friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He was in RNS associates and he was visited by a member of the German litigation who said to him, Would you like to buy a couple of Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I think my grandfather always kindof said that that's basically what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Would you like to buy somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And my grandfather said, Who? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And they said, Your daughter and her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And my grandfather said, I sat shiver (ph) for them two years ago because my grandfather did -- was observant a little then. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And they said No, they're alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They're alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And so an arrangement was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And from what I understand, and I can't prove it, but I know that the fact that they had warehoused them for two years -- in the back of their mind, it was a product. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">My -- my -- it was a product to be -- it was currency that could be converted at any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And an accommodation was made, and my grandfather -- the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and they told my mother and dad, 48 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">48 hours or -- and then right after that, the -- the rest of the people went to -- within six months, they were all gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They closed it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And they went -- they did the route to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , and they were supposed to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and -- and wait it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And the average wait was, like, a year-and-a-half, two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And my grandfather had very intelligent advisers, and one of them said to him, You know you're sponsoring your kids, but they're grown people. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Your grandchildren have status as first-paper Americans and they're refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Have them sponsor their parents, my mother and dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Because it's a [compassionate] and no argument at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Immediately after we filed papers, immediately my mother and dad came from <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And it was -- there's an interesting bypass to this -- this part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">If 1 may, my dad worked his way, you know -- he did what he could, and he got some Austrian woman and my mother they crocheted the shopping bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">You know, in Europe, they used the net shopping bags which nobody in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> did so the -- the Austrian ladies would sit there and embroidercolor hand -- onto this netting to make handbags. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And my dad took them to <span class="BUILDING">Bloomingdale's</span> and started to sell them -- you know, he was much of an entrepreneur, and he handled slippers, you know, that -- there were cottage made and he sold those, and then he got into the import/export business. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And in 1947, the American government called my dad in and they said -- you know, he had become a citizen -- and they said, You know your <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Your <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed because it was making rainwear but your father-in-law who had died, his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> is there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gupendolfush dausen</span> (ph), but the equipment all went east to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but it's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Would you consider coming back? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We can offer you projection as an American citizen, not a lot of protection because it was behind the iron curtain but -- and we can't tell you that you can get any money on it right now, but it would help <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> come back on its feet and you have connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And so my dad -- my -- my -- the family said, you know, everybody you knew it like the -- their father's right-hand man, he went back starting in '47, went back and rebuilt <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Airkaklidafabrake</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And about '49 my mother started going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">My father was not a happy man there. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I mean, you know, but my mother, bygones, bygones. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It never occurred to her that all of her friends never lost a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Still had the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Still -- and she would -- it never -- the only way you could be that way 1s if you were one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You know, and they were all Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And she -- she was friends with them 'till she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And she was -- she was a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I remember my deb -- they -- they lived in a ponceon (ph) right on Amgraddam (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Do you know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="262"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amgraddam</span> (ph) is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shopping district</span> like <span class="DLF">Rodeo drive</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I have -- I was -- I was there just recently, last November, and I took pictures withmy -- with my grandson. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And she -- they lived in a ponceon (ph) the whole time and she -- she just kept -- kept going. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">She just enjoyed life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And when they were let out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , the first place they went to was back 2 <span class="DLF">Elizabeth Street</span> , and they knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And the man opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and my mother said she could see all her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And the man said, What do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And she said, Well, We used to live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And he said, You don't live here anymore, and he slammed the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">In about 1962, '63, my mother and my dad are eating in a very fine <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and my dad said -- and you have to remember, my dad was about 5'3, 5'4. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He said to my mother, Excuse me, and he left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and he walked to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> across the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where a gentlemen was eating with a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And he said, You remember me? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And the guy said, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And he said, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You should remember me. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">You lived in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">2 Elizabeth StraBe 1941, and I came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and you slammed the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And he brought his voice up a notch, and the guy said, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And my grandfather -- my father, very quietly, said, Oh, you must remember me, and repeated the story at a higher voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And when he got to where he was talking very loudly, the man called for his check and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And my dad went back to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , put his napkin in his lap, said, Let's eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And that -- that's a marvelous story because my dad -- my dad was a very quiet man. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Greatest American that live lived, most patriotic American that ever lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Loved this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And the only protection they had was he lived in the -- he lived -- the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">5th district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">second district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He lived in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> -- first or second then he moved to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> when my mother move -- came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And, you know, because of the McCarran-Walter Act, he could not be out of thiscountry six months and a day, you know, naturalized citizens had to, you know -- had to be here for at least -- then he had to stay here six months, and it was just an inconvenience to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I mean, he -- he said, I'm not going nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I'm an American citizen, and I'm -- you know, I'm doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And he did very well in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , and he actually was able -- I was -- I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> working in -- I was -- I was in the Air Force, and I was the German-American Press Officer for the Air Forces of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And when I got that assignment, I called my dad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and I said, Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I can get out of this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">All I've got to do is tell them who -- that you spent time in a <span class="BUILDING">German prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And my dad said, 20 years is too long to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I'll meet you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dietzenbach</span> (ph) is right outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , and they would come and they would spend some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">My mother loved that we lived up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in a -- at a cor or (ph), you know, and they would go in the afternoon, listen to music. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">My dad was never happy in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he -- he -- he believed in his principle. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">His principle was, It's 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You got to do what you got to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And he was very proud of the fact that I was -- that I could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I do have to tell you one -- and I -- I'm digressing, but you know, I -- I've done this before. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I tell stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I was the information officer Dietzenbach (ph) air base. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And among the things that we had was the Glendola (ph) band of Europe, the Air Force band, which is equivalent to the -- the air force band that's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , and the -- was the same band that Miller conducted when he was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And they played from Glen Miller (ph) music, they played from Glen Aus (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And I would -- because I spoke German, and I would take them on -- I would be -- I would be their <span class="BUILDING">press office</span> , and I would do Voice of America Interviews, and we went on a Red Cross tour ofAustria, and we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> playing at the <span class="BUILDING">concert hall</span> with 2,000 seats. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And the concery (ph) had some problems because it was during the Vietnam War. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And when we came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span> , there were two empty rows which is really frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">You know, I mean, it's -- it implied threat, and it was a 49-piece brass concert band, really unbelievably good music. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And they -- I -- I did the announcing. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I did the announcing for this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And after about three numbers in the audience, they had just played the Braums Academic Festival Overture (ph), and people said, That's -- that's not a oompa (ph) band, and I came on and my German was pretty good, but I had a script. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I said, You're going to have to excuse me because I need this paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I said, From my accent you probably can't tell that I was born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I got a lot of applause. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I said, As a matter of fact, I was born in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and I got a lot of applause. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And I said, As a matter of fact, my mother and my father are sitting right there; my mother and my father with four friends are sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And my mother's down like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I said -- I said, now, I'm not a musician, but I think what you will agree that these gentlemen are -- and everybody, yes, because they were magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And I said, therefore, for my mother in the city of my birth, My Fair Lady, and they played. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And my mother is crying away, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And -- but to give you an idea of what kind of a debutante my mother was -- now we're talking about '68 so my mother's 63 years old, and she comes back stage with my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I introduce them to my conductor, and she said, Would you have -- we're having a little coffee at the <span class="BUILDING">Intercontinental Hotel</span> , which is one block from the course (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We would love it 1f you and the conductor, Miche Delfonso (ph), and the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> would join us for coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I'm her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I -- we've been touring <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , walking around allday. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And she never mentioned it until she was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So I did a Voice of America interview, and we walked down the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And, you know, they're great musicians, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> appreciates good music. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> was filled with people who had been at this concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And we did Glen Miller (ph) the whole after the -- and as we walked in, when the conductor walked in, everybody stood up and applauded. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And you know what a good feeling that is for a professional musician who's a military man to be applauded. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Not because he was a Air Force officer, but because he was the conductor of a really good orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And we had this wonderful dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And -- and I mean, wonderful coffee and shla (ph) coffee ve shla (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And then my -- my dad, in '68, I was getting ready to come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in -- in '69, I was coming back, early '69. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He said, I'm tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He's 76. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It's '68. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He came back and he said, It's my last trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We -- we sold -- we've sold it to the European part of family. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We've gotten our money out. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I'm going to retire. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And he was dead in two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Couldn't -- came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I think if he had worked, he would have kept on working because that was his -- and my mother -- my mother lived another -- 76 -- 60 was when he died, she was 62. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And she died at 94. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">She lived another 32 years and went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">She went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when she was 91 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And she would go to co orts (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="353">She went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shroonz</span> (ph), and she kept those forshluganuh (ph) people as friends all her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And it was -- it was -- it's an interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But I -- I'm little different about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I don't -- I don't know -- I, you know, I -- I meet people and they ask me about -- and I do talk on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And they say to me, What do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And I said, I've read some of these books. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Some of these books are, like, these 5-year-old children will have anepiphany, Oh, I was totally aware of this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">That's -- that's bologna because at age five it's a guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It's -- it's fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I remember sitting in my <span class="DLF">back yard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and watching Lufbafa (ph) fight the RAF, and I thought it was wonderful, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And -- and riding on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with Zowy (ph), you know -- and so my mother wasn't there to annoy me, and my father was -- was never <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="827">And we have a good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Well, I love all my grandsons. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">It's just fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I take every one of them when they turn 12, I take them out to Bar Mitzvah trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And I started with Joe. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And the deal is you get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> on a Friday afternoon and we go somewhere basically where -- the first trip where we went on a NFL

id="833">And now I have got it pretty well refined. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Lincoln, I took one of them flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">We flew around the Statute of

stays in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And it's your party. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">The deal is you said you would like to do this, if you're tired or you're bored, we are out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">We will find something else to do in the two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I know your

off at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , say 'Thank you." </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And usually in the beginning it's like kind of quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And then we just chat because I always make sure we do some driving like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">We drove from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> to the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="864">QUESTION:  Challenging.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Very impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I said, "So what else do you want to talk about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="868">You know, so he got out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And he's getting -- he had his headset and he's listening to music crap. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Within an hour he's got the headset off and we're having a good, we are having a -- because my wife used to say it's amazing my boy -- my grandsons love me and until they go on that last trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">After that last trip they are yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">That's really funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">We will sit somewhere and they will sit shoulder -- on my shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">You know, we sit in theliving room both boys sit -- I'm not --I'm not Oppa and I'm not Vaggy. (</span><span class="sentence" id="875">Ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And I'm not Pop Pop. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I would kill the first child that calls me Pop Pop. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I hate that. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And then it's -- they call my grandpa. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And we have -- one of them called my gramps and that's my inventor and he does that just to irritate me. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And he also when I started getting bold he was also the one that does this to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But other than that I've got a good life, you know, I have been -- I enjoy what I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And I know a lot of people just because I -- I don't -- I have been having an interesting time here. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And I went to this seminar on can we do a plan from the next possible Kindertransport? </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Is it possible to come up with a plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And of course, the argument was in this modern day and age if it's a disaster like -- she started to talk about Katrina. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I said we can do Katrina, the world can save Katrina because we have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And we have the equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And we can go down to <span class="COUNTRY">Haiti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I did the <span class="COUNTRY">Haiti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">McGuire</span> as retired and I helped with the Haitian Airlift. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I helped the refugee thing because that's what I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I said but the Kindertransports, <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> needed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Kindertransporter</span> but because they were black it was messy. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And so the final thing she said was we have to sum this up. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I said, "You know, the next time you need a Kindertransport for a specific group, put them in a <span class="DLF">mine</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> where within 69 days everybody will be rescued and there will be no political stuff because that's what the world does best. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I mean this thing with the miners. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So let's put the problem into a <span class="DLF">mine</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chili</span> and the world will solve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Otherwise, <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> is still not solved. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> ; not solved. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">They are still finding bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">QUESTION:  Haitian. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">A: Yeah, it's horrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Those are the problems that will not be solved -- because people didn't like each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">But everybody likes a good story and those miners were a good story and the world did their thing perfectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I mean there was no flag because they all flew the Chilean flag and they made sure but it was done correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And that's -- if we could solve the world's problems, if we can put the problems in a <span class="DLF">mine</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chili</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And that's the way I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">You know, I kind of came to -- I was listening to this conversation on a -- I don't particularly like a lot of the -- a lot of the Austrian Jews have quite a bit of them because we didn't get reparations for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">They treated us like idiots. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">So this lady from the Austrian deligation, the gentleman from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">You could ask him a question and he would think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And you know, "Yeah, we were wrong." </span><span class="sentence" id="913">You know, you are, you know, fourth generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">She said she started to talk about all of the wonderful things that the Australian government, all of these programs for the poor benefited Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And she went on and on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And somebody said to her, "How many Jews are left in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="917">How many Jews?" </span><span class="sentence" id="918">She said, "Well, I could kind of go with 3,000. "</span><span class="sentence" id="919">We are up to 15,000 but there are not the 15,000, the Austrian Jews, the upper middle class society that held with the culture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">It's Russian, Ukrainian, you know, Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And people hardworking labors basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">It's one step down. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And she said, "15,000." </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And I was texting Shelly. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And I said, "This lady from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> just tells me they have 15,000 --" she said, there are 15,000 Jews left in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">She listed enough programs that every Jew could have one special project because she kept talking about all of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">There is only 15,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">They couldn't do all of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">This is all people wanting to play this "Give game," youknow. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And it's wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">It's wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And I'm not -- I'm not a fan of the Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I don't mind the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I enjoyed, you know, at least you can, you know, that's the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="935"><span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> is still in this to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And the Austrian -- I mean here, you know, a lot of the people here from here from the Holocaust do not like their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home county</span> and will not visit or visit and are very uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">QUESTION:  When did you visit for the first time after the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="940">After the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="941">When was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  1968 when I took -- the first time I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was when I took the band, the Glen Miller band to Grats and Mimins and the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And then I visited again with my wife and kids again in '68. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And then just last November I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in 2009 with my grandson.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  And your grandparents went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  My grandfather died young, he died when I was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So he died in 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  And he died in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">He -- well, I told you he came and he said, "I'm going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ," and he played the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And my grandmother lived to be 96. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And marvelous woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Marvelous woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And the family they put her into a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> but a real nice one. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I used to visit her.</span><span class="sentence" id="956">And she she would be -- she was 90. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I would say, "Why don't you go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Those are old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I don't go with old people." </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And she was the oldest person there. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And so at that time her son, my uncle Walter whom I love dearly, bought her a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television set</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And I understand every morning she read the large print edition of the New York Times. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I mean that's how good she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And she watched television. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">She watched sports and cartoons not because it moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">You know, when you get to be 90years old and you're bored and your language, that's not your primary language, sports is easy to watch and cartoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So my uncle Walter tells a story that it was the finals of the NCAA Basketball Tournament between Michigan State and Magic Johnson. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">These are people that you don't know but these are great athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And nine out the ten players on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> were black. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And they are all big and they were running up and down in the sports shorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And my grandmother is, he's kind of watching the game, you know, a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And she says to him, "Walter, what are they doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="973">He said, "They are playing basketball Mom." </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And she said, "Oh." </span><span class="sentence" id="975">She watched for a while and she said, "Which are the Jewish boys?" </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And they were nine, six foot, inch when they are going for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">You know, but that's a fond memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">That's a fond memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">She was a wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I like, I dearly loved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">She loved us which was the interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I have no idea where she spawned a spoiled brat of a child that was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And who -- at 90 was a spoiled brat. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">She was entertaining and she, you know, and like I said, I told you I thought Betty White would play her in the movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Bill Burke would have played her in the movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">That's before your time. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">That was my mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And but my kids loved her because grandma was synonymous with presents. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">My wife on the other hand ran my kids a little bit better. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">My daughter had Aaron who was very bright and he was two years -- coming up on two. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And she would say dada and she wouldn't say momma. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And she said, "You know, mom --" she my wife baby-sat for her one day because she was doing some work and her sitter was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And she said, "You know, that kind of hurts." </span><span class="sentence" id="995">She says -- they work for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Her husband worked for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">She says, "He will says daddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">He won't say momma." </span><span class="sentence" id="999">So she went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">She came back about fourhours later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And Betty said to Aaron, "Who is that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And Aaron said, "Momma." </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And she said, "Who am I?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">She said, "Momma." </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And she said, "How did you do that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">She said, "Really stmple.</span><span class="sentence" id="1007">We had lunch and I said, 'Do you want dessert?' </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">She said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I said to him, if you want dessert say momma." </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He said momma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And later on she said, "Do you want some candy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">What, do you say?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Momma." </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">So within 30 minutes she taught them how to say a word that my daughter had been working on for months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">But that's the difference between my wife and my mother, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">My mother would be the person that would talk about herself for hours and at the end of it, she would say, "Well, that's enough about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Let's talk about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">What do you think of me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I mean that was the attitude that she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And it was charming but at the same time after a while, you know, it's, it's up here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And it's not, it's not deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">But I was five when I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I was in six -- well, five when she left me, you know, to go to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And I was always taken care of by nannies and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So my bonding with my mother was never really a bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And it was her problem; not mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">When we came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> she was busy- they were trying to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">My dad came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">But the minute they came back into the situation where they -- where they could do well, it became her story again and not mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">You got to remember she went back in 1940 -- 1950, she went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to spend six months out the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I was 17, she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I was a freshman in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I got to be an anchor -- you know, at <span class="BUILDING">Ohio State</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">She could do that and never look back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And never look back on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And there was no nanny for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And I was a hard case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I mean I was -- I know what I wanted which I had no idea what was it but I knew what I wanted that's why, "He's a big boy." </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Q: What did your dad do when he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1040">ANSWER:  Well, first thing he did was he looked for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And he came up with this idea of the pitman shortage was starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And in Europe women carry net shopping bag, you know, fishnet shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And so like I said, he got my mother's friends who are all wonderful because they were all society women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">They could all do embroidering and they could do this stitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And they stitched these handles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Beautiful colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">They got the most colorful rolls to do that and he immediately started selling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">He took two dozen to <span class="BUILDING">Bloomingdale's</span> and they ordered 100 dozen the first day he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Now he's got to get woman in <span class="DLF">line</span> to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And then he did this and he did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And then he became politely put it he became a facilitator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">He went into the import/export business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">During the War and after the War he was friends with -- he made friends with a guy named Sam Spig -- Sam Spiggel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And they had their European contacts and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And whenever something was needed, they understood how to get it legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Not illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Legally they knew where to get things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">They would -- the need -- like my dad invented these shopping bags for Americans but knowing it from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">They had a pretty good business together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And then Sam's son came out of the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And he was a radar operator, you know radar was new and television had just started, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">The World Series in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">There was and the first television was shown at the World's Fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And the son came to us there and he said, "Television is the future." </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I know how to build -- you know, at that time you could buy a kit to make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television set</span> with tubes and the whole bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">They are going to be hundreds of <span class="BUILDING">television stations</span> around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they need monitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">They will need the monitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">It's nothing but a television set for one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> basically 1swhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I want to build perfectly, correctly done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I'll buy the kits. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I want to build them and sell them to <span class="BUILDING">television stations</span> as their monitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And Sam came to my father and he said, "I want to get into this." </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">My father, you know, he was mechanically was a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">He said, "If it will make us a buck," and they did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">They made the first monitors for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">CBS New York</span> and WOR and <span class="BUILDING">Dumont station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">They had a good business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">They had about four or five of these guys who were really good at it.

without a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">And ifthe fight is nuclear, they're gonna go nuclear and the world will die because of that, so it behooves every <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1632">Now, I'm not as honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">I -- I believe <span class="REGION">land</span> for peace, but that's my opinion. </span><span
