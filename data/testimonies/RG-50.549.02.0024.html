ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  What happened to the brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , did not think that anything was going to happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Incidentally, he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and when my father did say to him -- his name was Ludwig, “Ludwig, things are getting tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Don’t you think you should go into hiding?” </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Ludwig had responded, “No, I’m going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and I know that’s where many of them are going and I’m sure I will be all right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Obviously, he was not all right, he was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">However, all the others, they lived and thrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So, to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , we -- we settled in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">These very nice people by the name of Pagrach found us a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and incidentally, they almost become surrogate family to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They found us a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I seemed to have really bonded with them, calling them Uncle Ohm -- Ohm and Tumter and Oma and Opa, in lieu of having any Omas or Opas around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So, my father started his new life and seemed to do quite nicely, I think, from an economic point of view, we -- we were all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My mother was and still is, a very gregarious woman and she quickly made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Jewish community</span> , it seems that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> , a lot of German Jews came over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and settled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my mother managed to make contact with some of them and she used to have her Saturday afternoon coffee klatches with them and seemed to be fairly content with her life, although I think living in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like that must have been a little bit frustrating to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I really don’t know if she was always very happy living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Was she a very cultivated person, who’d love music and <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and so on that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> -- city life would offer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  No, unfortunately she was not -- was not and is not. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">She was a very good looking, young woman and I think somewhat indulged in by both her father, as well as my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">She was more interested in being courted than perhaps going to <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , to concerts, to movies, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">She read. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I don’t know how much she read, but she read. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I really don’t know what her interests at that time were, other than to be able to set a nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and to entertain her friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And my father was a very, very good provider, but he too did not seem to be very much connected with -- he was quiet with the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He would go on Saturdays to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which was the proper thing for everyone to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He would play cards, I believe, perhaps once a week with some of, again, the German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They led a fairly self-contained life and there was really not much culture in and around that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And this is sort of the atmosphere I grew up in. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I adored my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was very much attached to her, to the point where I would be with her if I could have been with her, morning, noon and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was less attached to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I guess I admired my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She was a very good looking, always very well groomed, dressed lady and I must have been quite taken by that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  You were an only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  And I’m interested in knowing if you would suppose that to be the case because by the time you were born, there was clear -- clearly ominous signs on the horizon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I asked my mother once why it was that I was an only child and she said, “Well, the circumstances were not exactly propitious to have more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And of course, obviously, it was -- it was a g -- inadvertently, it was a good decision, because I think it would have been very difficult for us to have found two <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> -- I mean, <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> for several children. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I don’t think I considered myself to be a very spoiled child, but I don’t know, of course, that’s not for me to judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My mother was very, very strict, a fairly tough taskmaster or mistress and I was expected to obey and she -- in many ways she controlled me quite a bit, because if I were offered a cookie by a stranger, I would look and see if she would nod and say yes, you may take the cookie, or no you may not take the cookie. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And expected to make my little curtsy when I shook hands with somebody and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She -- She was strict, my dad was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He was more -- I think he was more loving, a little warmer than she. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I -- It’s very hard to recall the en -- really, the environment too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It -- I think, in many ways, that I perhaps got more nurturing from my adopted family, the Pagrachs or more attention from the Pagrachs, than I might have gotten at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It’s very difficult to describe this so many, many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In any case --
QUESTION:  Well, you know a thought occurs to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It’s interesting that your mother would seem to be perhaps a -- a little self centered and yet, when tested by life, she came through with such flying colors, of courage and fortitude and optimism, which is remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I wonder if you think those strengths in both your parents really came through s -- a spiritual sense? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">A s -- Convictions that were deep in the background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  I doubt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I really, really doubt it, but I think your point 1s well taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">There was this sort of -- well, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They were not -- They were not as warm or giving as I think they could have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I don’t know, but spiritual? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I think it was a matter of, we have to survive, we want to survive and no further thoughts were given to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It’s very possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">In any event, I would say it was a -- a good childhood, it was nothing extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I -- I got what I think I should have gotten and what I needed and I had my little friends, who would come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and play with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I read a lot, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and got very many books and I was encouraged to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I think my mother read to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My mother, incidentally played the piano and would play for me sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But, I have no remembrances of either one of my parents ever playing with me, playing games or really doing very many so-called fun things. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I’ve tried to -- to think if there were instances and the only instance I can remember where I was taken somewhere just for my pleasure, was some -- I guess you would call it a very fancy <span class="DLF">playground</span> in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But then again, my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> , did not have many opportunities for very many activities, so we had to make our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We certainly managed to do that and did it very, very well, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> really went on with friends and this -- the Pagrachs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Now you had taken identity papers from the Pagrachs when you went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">What was the purpose for doing that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  No, I did not take identity papers of the Pagrachs when I went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I got those papers after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">After the war, the Pagrachs came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> to, they were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">One sister perished, her name was Lien and I had the letter from the Red Cross in which they notified the family that Lien had died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I got that letter from Lien’s sister, whose name was Berta -- Bertha, and she also gave me other papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  And those are the papers I also turned over to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, was she -- was she also a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">The Pagrachs, there was a brother and there were two sisters and they were all contemporaries of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And the oldest sister came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and lived near us and as I said, I considered her truly an aunt and a member of the family and had a lot of fondness for her, and m -- when she came to -- we had her come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and when she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and couldn’t live there any longer, we moved her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockville</span> and we looked after her there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Now, moving along, what I was interested in knowing how you -- how your father arranged the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and whether his ability to reward somebody financially had any role in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">O-Or whether people would be given help through the organized resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Mm-Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Well, my father and -- arranged -- 1t was not done through an organized resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My father, because he knew very many farmers, had sort of, in a discreet way, tried to find who could he trust, who could he not trust and who could he contact and who could he not contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And found -- And knew a farmer with whom he had been doing business and had sort of dropped a hint, saying, you know, things are getting tough for us and when push comes to shove, I think we -- we probably have to try and hide ourselves rather than report. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And this man, whose name was Yolink and this figures very prominently in my survival, said, “Well, I have these --,” I think they were cousins of his and they were sh -- teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he said, “They are involved in the underground movement, or in the resistance movement and why don’t you talk to them, because I think they may know some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But,” he said, “I, myself, would be more than happy to take you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And, so that was arranged, that my father would meet those two ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And they -- And they’d had probably a number of addresses, one -- two of whom were the people where we ended up being in contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But, above all, Mr. Yolink said to my father, “I would be happy to kee-keep you, but not your wife and child, because I can only take one person.” </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And that’s how we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yolink</span> and then my father learned about the other families, but did not meet them at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was just a name -- two names that were given to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And one of the families had said they would take me and the other family said they’d take my mother and her mother, my grandmother, who, remember I said, had been left behind in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and came to live with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Why do you think these people did this and put their lives on the <span class="DLF">line</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  I think these people are -- first of all, they were -- especially the Hartamings where we stayed, were very deeply religious, they were Dutch Reformed and the Yolinks were also Dutch Reformed, perhaps a tad less religious than the Hartamings were. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I think it was religion, slash, humanitarian need to help your fellow man, because interestingly -- and I’m jumping ahead a little bit now, when I have spoken to them about why, they -- they sort of look at me in amazement and they say, “Well, we’d do it all over again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And Yolink’s son said, “Well, I don’t think it was such a big deal.” </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Well, it was a big deal indeed, because, after all, they put their lives and their <span class="DLF">farms</span> and their families on the <span class="DLF">line</span> for us, but over and over, over the years, they have said, no, they would do it again and it was only the right thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So, I guess it was indeed Christian as well as humanitarian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I’m jumping ahead also, to that wonderful moment you describe, o-of the -- at the end of the war, when you gave thanks in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I wonder if you’d talk more about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I was interested also, when your host family -- and I think it was the mother who prayed, were -- did you also -- those of you who were Jewish, did you also offer thanks? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Do you remember if there was more to the ceremony”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well, it wasn’t really a ce -- I don’t know if it wa -- 1t wasn’t really a ceremony, it was all -- the war was over and we all came out of our little crevices and, as I had mentioned before, we sat around this, what looked to me like a huge, round <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> they sat at every night and they ate their porridge and then they played the organ and they sang hymns. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So that the day of liberation, Mutter Hartaming, Mother Hartaming said, “Well, we should all sit down and eat,” I guess the porridge or whatever it was, together and all of us did there, six, seven children, Father and Mutter Hartaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My mother, my father and I, two or three other young men that were s-semi hiding there and our neighbors, whom I talked about on my tape, that had crawled into the <span class="DLF">hole</span> with us for the last few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And we all sat around that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and then Mutter Hartaming simply said, “Well, let us pray.” </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And we all sat and we bowed our heads and then she said, “I want to thank the good Lord for having allowed us to survive this and to be able to save --” and she named all of us and sort of said, “We thank the good Lord.” </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we all sat and then we said amen, and that was it and I think there were many a wet -- not too many dry eyes left after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Also, I think the Sunday after our liberation, we came back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> to accompany all of them to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> for a service, where we sat and prayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We looked at the prayer books and prayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Being Jewish didn’t make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And it was a very beautiful moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Do you have a memory of the shape that people were in physically then? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Would your parents -- I mean, would you be sitting in your -- the arms of one of your parents at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">farmhouse table</span> and think you were very weak, at the end of the war, but I wonder if the others too, were poorly nourished and ragged in your clothing and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  As a matter of fact, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I think all of us who came out, probably looked as well as we did when we went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My mother, who was blonde, I think her har -- her hair may have darkened a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I had gotten rather heavy and I think part of this was due to the illness, coupled with inactivity and I think I was a rather roly-poly, with long hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My father looked the same as he always did and the farmers themselves -- of course, we did not suffer from any malnourishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We were always very adequately provided for. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It may not have been gourmet food, but it certainly was good food and we -- what they had, they shared with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So no, I think -- and clothing-wise, it’s funny -- I don’t remember that too well, I know I must have outgrown the few clothes that I had when I went in, but I also know that as soon as we came out, someone gave me clothes, perhaps some friends, to fit me and my mother immediately went in search of her dressmaker and found some material to have herself some dresses made. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And dad had probably the same clothes he had before the war, so there was no -- no problem there, and I know when the war was over, we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> and the first thing I did -- and I don’t know why I did it, I had, at that time, very long braids, and I had them cut off, because I thought I had to start to look a little older, but I don’t think it helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  And you -- your mother was blonde, you were dark-haired as a child, and that would increase the risk of you being discovered, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Precisely. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My mother looked far -- well, my mother almost looked -- almost looked Aryan, because of her blonde hair, her sort of bluish gray eyes, whereas my father and I were typically Semitic looking people, very dark and that was another reason it was fortunate that I could go to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> with my mother, rather than to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> that I was pegged to go to, because I could not have been free to roam around, since I did look too Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  They do -- I was struck by the kindness of the farm people, which you talk about also. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The occasion when you became sick with rheumatic fever, was when the farm daughter had stayed with you, because it was one of -- your mother’s only visit, I think, to your father, but I thought it’s -- it’s striking kindness and sharing that went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Oh, they were, they -- they all, each and every one of them were absolutely warm and loving and wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The -- Actually, the father -- the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , if you will, we had very little interactions with and I think this was considered really to be a -- a women thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, with Susie Schwarz. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">This is tape number one, side B.
ANSWER:  Well, of course, with respect to my childhood, there are memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They’re all sort of jumbled. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There is the memory of my grandmother coming, which was a major, major event. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She was my uncle’s -- my uncle and aunt had left to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she was left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then, I think in °39, 1t was decided that she would come and stay with us until she could go to what was then still <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And she was set to go -- she must have been in her late 60’s, to me she looked ancient -- and came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> with all her earthly belongings, her jewelry and lots of luggage and she was sent back, which was a tremendous blow and I really don’t know why that happened, but she was sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then was not able to come back til the following year, which was already in 1940 or maybe it was even “41, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And when she came to live with us, I was very, very happy, because she did give me a lot of attention and she was always busy knitting, knitting sweaters for me and for my friends and would bake cakes and cookies and I would be allowed to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And she was very wonderful and my father, too, enjoyed her very, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But I think she was rather frail, and I mentioned this on the tape, too, she -- she died a few days before we went into hiding and that was all very traumatic and very, very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But she played really a major role in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  What would happen to all your worldly goods when you went into hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Our worldly goods -- some of our worldly goods were hidden, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There were a few contacts again that my father had, that said they would keep some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and furnishings. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I know -- I think the silver was buried in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And some of the worldly goods were simply abandoned when we left -- when we went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And when we came back after the war -- first of all, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was 90 -- 85 percent destroyed and my father said some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , he could even find in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , still, it was just chopped up. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But the people that had taken the bulk of it, returned it all to us and the silver and the crystal and whatever it was, was uncovered and it all came with us to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So we were very lucky that we could retrieve a lot of the things we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">After the war, it was really rough too, to pick up the pieces again and I don’t know if we should talk about that yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Yeah, I -- I also wondered -- you mentioned on the videotape, your father, the day he left to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Do you remember more about that moment or that day of saying good-bye to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It must have been hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I do know he left well ahead of us and I don’t remember, for example, a very dramatic good-bye or a hugging, kissing. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He -- He left. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I’m not sure if it was on the same day or perhaps the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He too -- He left alone, that I know, on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and I have a feeling that he went to this sort of in between <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where we also were taken to. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then, I was not aware of contact with my father, but my mother said that the farmers were in touch and knew he was all right and he was well. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And interestingly, now that I have gone back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> quite a number of times, I realize he was far closer to us than I thought at that time we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">As a matter of fact, I would say he was in 10 minutes walking distance from us, which was not far. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But, at that time, I think -- I thought it was very, very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It was -- Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  I was just thinking of possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Were there particular things that you had in your knapsack when you went into hiding, that really comforted and were precious to you or to you and your mother during the years of hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t think it was really a knapsack -- it may have been a knapsack, it may have been a suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">As a matter of fact, I think some of our personal things were taken to the farmers in advance of our going there, which must have included some clothing items, because when we went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , the evening that we were taken to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , I don’t remember that we had anything with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So, clothing and some personal items were taken along, but I don’t remember that anything specific of mine went along with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Perhaps a few books, I know my mother had a few books. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But all during our hiding time, I really did not see any -- many personal belongings, other than probably some blankets that we slept on, and pillows that were in our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> with us, but nothing more personal came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Come to think of it, I must have left all my books and toys, or whatever it was, behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I must have also left it behind without looking back or giving it further thoughts, because perhaps it wasn’t meaningful enough or it was just, well, we had to go and don’t think more about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Do you ever have dreams and if so, sort of what has -- what have you dreamt of, of this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  That’s a very good question to ask, because I’ve been talking about that a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I had dreams after the war was over and for many, many years -- subsequent years, including after I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and it was always the same dream, namely, I had two very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They lived within shouting distance, if you will, of where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Their name was Menist, M-e-n-i-s-t. There was a boy, he was the grandson of the local rabbi and his sister and my parents were very good friends with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And we were always playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">As a matter of fact, I would almost say they were amongst my best friends, and they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And after the war, I dreamt that I were -- I dreamt that they had survived and they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I would go to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where they lived, and there would be a woman and perhaps it was the mother who said, “Well, you can’t see them today, but come back tomorrow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And then my dr-dream continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I would go back and she would always say, “Well, you can’t see them now, but come back tomorrow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And that dream haunted me for years and years and years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And, as I said before, even after I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And that was about the only dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Did you ever find out what had happened to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They were both killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Most of the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we were, were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> and I know that for a fact, because of the research I’ve done. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And speaking of the Menist children, they too were a big part in my life, because th-the grandfather was the local rabbi and he attempted to give us Hebrew lessons, instill some Jewishness in us and we would meet every week, on Sunday, in his <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and he would teach us a little bit of history and little bit of the reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But I was never very interested and besides, Eeshe, the boy -- there were two other boys, who were also friends of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And the rabbi was very critical of me because I wouldn’t come to service every Saturday as he thought I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I did go sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I would sit in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s section</span> and instead of reading a prayer book, I would read Tilonspiegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And he would sometimes come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and walk through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I would be out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> playing and then on Sunday I would arrive at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he said, “I saw you playing with the Gentile children. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I don’t want to see that any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then one day he said to me, “You are not coming to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> often enough and the reason, Oma Pagrach 1s ill, is because you don’t come to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I -- I guess I must have been about eight, nine, 10, I don’t know, and it was, I got very angry at that and I said, “I’m not staying here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I got up and I was ready to leave, and Eeshe, his grandson said, “Well, shall I keep her?” </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And he said, “No, let her go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I ran out of there and it was bitter cold, without a coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And on my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I see a little girlfriend, I say, “Go back there and fetch my coat.” </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I said to my mother, “I will not go back, because he blames me for Oma Pagrach being ill.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And my mother said, “I agree with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And that was the end of my Jewish education and so therefore, I’m totally uneducated and that was an incident I remembered quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Sadly, of course, he too was deported and died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  Would they have thought of leaving the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Wh-What was in my mind was whether he would feel that it was important that he continue with his people t- to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  Again, I think that -- no, I think he -- he would not have contemplated leaving and I think that he also would -- I don’t know if he had any sort of philosophy, I want to stay with my people or with my flock til the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He was old, he was -- I think he was primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But how do I know, I was so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I think he just went, as many of the others went. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He met his fate and apparently, I was told afterwards, he must have been very upset when they were collected on the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> to be sent wherever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He was very agitated and angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But just like all the others, he met his fate and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There was another women there whom we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Her name was Mrs. Schwab. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">She was also German and my father, toward the very end, mentioned that he could find her a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And she was one who said, “Well, I’m not going to go because they won’t have kosher food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I think I mentioned that in my tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And she was, of course, killed, together with all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was a nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I think the people were very nice, but I think they all knew -- many of them knew that things would not continue to go well for them and there were always rumors and they were always speculating what is going to happen to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  I wanted to -- you to tell me, first of all, in your first few months in hiding, when you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> , what do you remember about following each day and having a sense of time then? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And then go on to tell me how your mother coped and whether she was able to deal with the situation more ably than your father in his <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And to what extent she always kept up her defenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Interestingly, my recollections of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> are fairly vague. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I see it in front of me, how we went into it and we were lying on those huge sacks of milled flour, I think 1t was and it had a very dr -- it was very dry and stuffy. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It was as if you are constantly inhaling dust, but of course it didn’t -- there was an odor to it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So, it was big enough that we could stretch out in it and we were lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I don’t think we could sit [indecipherable] positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And they would -- they put us in there and we had a little receptacle in case we had to use the toilet facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And must have been given some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">What I do remember quite well though, 1s at night, the daughter, or one of the daughters would come, open the lid and told us to go out, because this was in a -- in an attic-like <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Opened up the lid, we would go out, stretch, walk and we were given food at that time and I guess maybe we washed ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It’s -- It is truly very vague. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And while we were lying in there, my mother and I would of course talk incessantly and she always tried to put a positive thing on everything, this is only going to be a short time, they are going to find us another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and told me stories, which she did the whole time anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But also, during that time, I wasn’t well. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I think that was the -- probably already a forerunner of what was to come, because one evening, when the daughter took us out, I had chills and I was really not feeling well. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I had the sore throat already. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So, mother was ma -- mother was positive and I was, I think, fairly weepy and well, we stayed there and I wish I remembered how long it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I can’t believe it was all too long and then we were transferred to the other wonderful <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> that I called it, that we occupied for the remainder of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And, with respect to my father, there was little contact and strange, I -- I wasn’t homesick for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I think I was too busy trying to adjust to that life that I had to lead there with my mother, that I could not think too much about my father’s absence. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">It was [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  Tell me about the one occasion when your mother did let her feelings -- reveal her feelings to you, of disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  And it was only one occasion that that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It was during the time -- it must have been in ‘44, I think, when the allies had this aborted invasion of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ironham</span> , I think that’s eventually, what the movie, “One <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> Too Far,” was based on and they were sent back and we had hoped that the end was in sight, and we were all so euphoric about it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And then it all came to naught and then my mother was very down, I would almost say depressed, and said, “I don’t think we’ll ever get out of here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And another thing she said to Mutter Hartaming, “I guess if you had known that it would last this long, would you have taken -- you wouldn’t have taken us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And she said, “We took you, no matter how long it would be.” </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But my mother is one of these people who you can’t keep down too long and she recovered from this tremendous disappointment and the farmer said to, “An end will come and you have to continue to hope.” </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So, we went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Well, I wanted to ask you about -- your mother told you stories, that helped to pass the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Has that been important in your life since then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Of course, many of the stories have stayed with me and many of the songs that she has taught me have stayed with me and I really savor them and enjoy it, is it important? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Has it made a difference in my life? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I don’t know, I don’t know what the answer to that would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">My mother wo -- as I said, I was very connected to her as a young child, I was afraid to leave her and yet she was -- I mentioned that too, she was very strict as -- very strict, a real disciplinarian of the old <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And she continued this after the war, too and I think I rebelled a lot and became very -- 1n some ways, she was very intim -- controlling and intimidating and I think I had a hard time working on that and working through all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So, am I really answering? </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Yes, there are a lot of things that stayed with me and that I remember very well and remember with fondness. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And the other side of it is that there are also a lot of things that I remember very well, with not that much fondness, because I think her being so very controlling, has, 1n some ways, at times, hampered me in my development.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  In what sort of ways are you -- and -- and when would you have been working through that? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">In the -- Would that have begun in -- when you went to the <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , sort of, or in your years here alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  I think, in my years here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , alone, although -- because even while I was at <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span> , I still felt very controlled by her. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I was controlled as a young child, 1.e. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">the cookie incident where, you know, you shouldn’t always take -- accept cookies or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montessori</span> , 1t was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> and I only went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on occasions, but even then, I was supposed to -- to do her bidding. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I think one of the reasons that I went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when I did, and as I did, was probably to get -- become a little bit more independent, because I think I realized that she was too -- too controlling. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And my father was not at all, but she was and I think that continued through my early and late adolescence and even my early adulthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  On the other hand, I cannot imagine that you would have survived if you had been in hiding, not allowed to come out of your <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , without your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  That’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">You’re right. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Her -- Her -- Her strength and her dominance was what got us through. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I think if she hadn’t been as strong as she was and if she hadn’t been the no-nonsense type of person that she was, and if she hadn’t been as resourceful, I think it may have been very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I always have to think of her having to be there with a- a young child between the ages of 12 and 14, and it was no easy task.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  This was not a normal adolescence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  No, it was not -- it was not at all a normal adolescence and interestingly, I can’t even - I can’t even identify what -- what was right at that time or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I mean, what kind of thinking I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You know, girls of 12 and 14 have their interests and problems and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I don’t even know what, if any, I had, other than there is tomorrow and the next day and the next day and all those days really had very little to offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Of course, in hiding, one of the highlights was that I was being taught on occasion by the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The daughter’s fiancé, and that was really very, very wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  And that sounded as if your mother’s resourcefulness had been at work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  He’s a teacher, he can be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  And immediately, that was under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  Yes, it was her resourcefulness, as well as the farmer’s daughter, who suggested that she bring in her fiancé. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">A-After all, he was trustworthy, his family was hiding people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So, yes, and mother encouraged that, of course and that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And also, after the war was over, it was she who must have come up with the idea of my going to <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> , realizing that I could not stay in the little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which would have been a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And sent me to that <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> and I still have to find out how they were able to fund all that, cause it must have been frightfully expensive, it being a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , slash, lyceum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Why was the -- Why would it have been a disaster to be at the <span class="BUILDING">village school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Very -- The reason 1t would have been a disaster 1s, I should have been at the -- at 14, I should have been in the <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , and had I stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- and I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, I was in six or seventh grade, so I was in with the wrong age group and that was not very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Also, I had difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Remember, I had missed <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for many, many years and it was very hard to catch up. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And I think the reason the <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> came along as my -- again, the Pagrachs suggested my mother take me to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnam</span> and have some testing done to see what I was capable of doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And I do remember I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnam</span> , which at the time was considered to be the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and I was tested and when the report came back, it said that perhaps I should be sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I could progress at my own speed and see what would happen to me and then make a decision later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And I think that’s how the Montessori came about, which was really a terrific decision, because again, the <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> was very good for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I could indeed progress at my own speed. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I may have progressed in the wrong <span class="REGION">areas</span> , because I concentrated more on -- on learning languages and literature and history rather than in math. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But, it was a good environment, I was around young people my own age for the first time ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And it was a little bit of an adjustment to be suddenly thrown into this- this type of an environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It was a fairly exclusive <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and very, very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But, I made some friends and I was very happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I had a very nice time and we’d go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every few weeks for a weekend and in turn would be invited at some newly made friends <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a weekend and it was a rather posh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We learned dancing and sailing and hockey and tennis and it was all very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But, then, after two years at <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span> , I was 16 and had I stayed at <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span> , I would have ultimately have to take what they call a state or a final exam, to matriculate, and I was very concerned about it, too, because I did not know if I was up to par. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And the family in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> kept agitating that I should come and spend a year there, just to forget about what had happened or -- and I think the reason they did that too, because they were hoping that my parents, particularly my father would ultimately come and be reunited with his siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So, I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I guess, to me, it was an adventure to go across the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and to be independent and go on my -- be on my own, although I had to -- I was going to live with my father’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So, the idea was for me to go for a year, go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and then come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And, in the <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> , of course, the children all thought that was pretty neat [indecipherable] someone to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was still Hollywood, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and all these wonderful -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A

<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> , there was one other Jewish girl there, her name was Marishka. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I think she was Hungarian and I really don’t know anything about her background. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Either she had been 1n hiding, too, or perhaps she came -- I don’t think she survived a camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And all the other children that were there were children of, I guess some of the Dutch, either aristocracy, as there were some -- a few girls, they were vaguely connected to the royal family and a lot of children whose parents were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> , and the parents being <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> , they sent the children to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But it was all very democratic and really very nice.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I -- The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> definitely, definitely did not give scholarships and it must have been a sacrifice, because I cannot imagine that 1t was very inexpensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It was -- As I said, 1t was a very small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was a very exclusive setting and the type of children that were sent there, I think it must have been fairly expensive, and I really don’t know where the money came from, if my father had indeed done that well again, or if someone lent them the money, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But, I do think it was a wonderful thing that they did for me, having sent me to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> instead of suffering through another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  Yes, I wonder if you have any memories about the attitudes of the other children there? </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Were they at all anti-Semitic? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Did you talk openly about what had happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Not just the -- to the Jews, but really, do you remember discussions about the war, and what they’d all si -- gone through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  I remember one specific incidence, because this is interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I’m sure I must have talked about it, and I had one friend who -- well, who roomed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">As a matter of fact, there were two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We sh -- There were three of us in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And one of whom I became very friend -- good friends with, she w -- visited me in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I think she immigrated here eventually, herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And no feeling of anti-Semitism whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I think the headmaster was Jewish, I’m fairly sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">However, one of the roommates was a young woman who had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> and asked me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a weekend and I accepted and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with her in a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I remember a remark she made, oh, her family really liked me, although in general, they were not too keen on Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And that was fortunately the one and only remark that was made and I don’t even remember how I responded to it, or how I handled it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I do know I never did invite her to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , nor did I ever go with her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But we stayed on very good terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  You know, I’m -- I’m remembering that when I was first told your story in just brief details, in my mind, of course, was Anne Frank and her diary, but, do you think that there are any things in Anne Frank’s story or experiences that are -- that you share in common with her? </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Superficially, your experiences were very similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  The experiences were very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">As a matter of fact, I think, age-wise, we were fairly close. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Interestingly, she came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , which was not that far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlichtern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">No, I really don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I alway think, having of course read her diary several times, she was more -- a much more introspective, much more thinking person at that age than I was, ergo her diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">When I wrote my so-called cookbook diary, which I interspersed with little things, they were never very thoughtful or significant, other than what was going on with the war, what the family, meaning the farmers, were doing, and what my mother and I were doing, whereas I think Anne Frank led a more -- ma-maybe more profound life, a more thinking life. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I think she came from a very different environment than I did, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So, do I have anything in common with her, other than that we were hidden? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">No, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I saw her <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> this summer and of course, compared to my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , they were living in luxurious <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But, those luxurious <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> were not that good for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It does -- It seems to me, too, that she may have been more living a life of the mind when you were also so bonded with your mother, who may have been discouraging that. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">You may have survived emotionally unscathed, as you said you had, partly because you were keeping in the present. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Maybe remaining a child longer than you would have otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  I think I did remain a child much longer than I would have under normal circumstance, or even if we are comparing or trying to see if there’s any connection or -- or whatever, with Anne Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I think I was more connected with my mother than Anne was with her -- both her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And yes, I was kept a child and that may have helped me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I think I was not yet a real adolescent and Anne Frank was, even beyond that. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And perhaps that is why I consider I came out of there un -- relatively unscathed, because I still came out as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I was a child at 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I think I was still a child at 16 and perhaps that was to the good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  And it may have been a blessing, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Yes, it -- perhaps it was to the good, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And, what about physically, the physical aftermath of the -- the hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Physically, of course, when I -- while I -- when I was in hiding, I started menstruating and became aware that I was a woman, but even that was taken very much as -- it was a non-event. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was -- matter of fact, 1t was a nuisance, because, given the circumstances we were in, it was not very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But I never thought, “All right, now you -- you have passed a <span class="DLF">threshold</span> and now you’re entering womanhood.” </span><span class="sentence" id="379">These things never occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I also did not have romantic fantasies, as -- again, as Anne Frank did. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I think I became aware of boys when I went to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , where I did -- well, had my little flirtations with the boys, because, by the way, I think I did mention, it was a -- the first coed Montessori school, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And, you know, we all had our little fantasies and so-called romances, but I was a child and my family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , they confirmed that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">They said when they picked me up and brought me to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they were very surprised how -- what a young child I was at 16, because, after all, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , even then, at 16, the girls and the boys are more -- more forward, more developed and of course, not as sheltered. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I was a very, very sheltered child before the war and even somewhat after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  Mm, it’s u -- it’s actually a funny term to use, you being sheltered, captive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I was sheltered in more ways than one. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I was emotionally sheltered and physically sheltered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Now, what about -- do you have any physical problems that resulted from your rheumatic fever and from those years of little movement, and --
ANSWER:  Well, physical problems were just that I developed -- because of the rheumatic fever, they think that was the cause of a -- a <span class="DLF">mitral valve</span> , or heart murmur. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But it did not hinder me in any way as a young woman, I participated in the swimming and the tennis and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">That only manifested itself in later years, maybe because this valve has seepage or leaking and as I got older, it became a little bit more debilitating, til finally, in 1988, it got so debilitating that the decision was made to repair that valve. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So, as I like to say, in 1988, I had a valve job and in 1998, it is still holding up, so the warranty ran out and it’s still going strong and I don’t think I have, other than the brief period of time when it was somewhat incapacitating, with shortness of breath, things like a rapid heartbeat, it has not really kept me from doing all the things that I’ve always enjoyed doing, such as hiking, tennis and all the other fun activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Let’s move on to that story now, of coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">How did you come? </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Where did you live, what did you begin to do and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , as I said, supposedly for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">How did I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="399">In ‘47, it was still very difficult to move around, and my family managed to book passage for me on the SS Ernie Pyle -- you know, Er-Ernie Pyle was a war correspondent and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ship</span> was named after him and then it was converted to transport people. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">But, I had to pick up that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lahavre</span> and my parents could not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">By the way, they never got their Dutch citizenship, they kept their ger -- well, we were stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I came on a stateless passport to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But, again, a friend of the Pagrach’s said he would accompany me as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And then, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , we connected with another young woman who was also going to board that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So, my parents took me to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and we said good-bye and I think --
QUESTION:  Tell me about that good-bye.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  That must have been difficult, but again, it’s hazy and I don’t remember a thing, other than going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , getting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it must have been a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeper</span> , I would think, and getting off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , with this man who was a cousin of the family Pagrach, who incidentally, was a survivor from a camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Had dreadful, dreadful stories to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Wonderful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And he came with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> we met this woman, her name was Margot Faulk, I remember her name and I remember also the first evening we were there, this man and this woman wanted to go to the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulin Rouge</span> or one of these clubs and they didn’t know what to do with me and decided to take me along. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Oh, it was called the <span class="BUILDING">Casino de Paris</span> and for me that was big adventure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  You were 16”
ANSWER:  I was 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Sweet 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And I don’t even remember the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we stayed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I only do remember we went to this <span class="BUILDING">Casino de Paris</span> and must have then, the next day, said good- bye to this man and went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lahavre</span> , where we boarded this, what looked to me, enormous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And there were thous -- I don’t know how many people on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And we didn’t have <span class="INT_SPACE">cabins</span> , we were in sort of <span class="INT_SPACE">dormitories</span> and there was a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> for men and a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> for women. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">A lot of farmers were going on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and I -- my guess 1s the-they were a lot of Dutch and maybe Belgian and French, who could not make it any more in Europe and went either to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , which actually, several of our -- of our farm families children did, they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> and neighboring <span class="REGION">areas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  Are -- That’s cause it was -- life was hard in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Yeah, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So, we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , this woman, Mar-Margot and I and I was mighty glad to have her, because I would have been totally lost and I -- I was rather timid and not very happy at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Now, that I remember very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It’s interesting, I don’t remember saying good-bye to my parents and don’t remember details of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> stay, but I do remember being overwhelmed by that big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And then we were assigned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunkbed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I think they were triple <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and I remember we had to eat in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> and this Margot and I amused ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">We were sort of left to our own devices and it was a 10 day journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I was a little bit seasick and I think I was quite homesick already then, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But she -- she was very wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I think she ended up going to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , but I’m not too sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  What language would you speak?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  She spoke Dutch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Yes, so that was --
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And incidentally, yes -- so she spoke Dutch and most -- a lot of the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> were Dutch, but we did not have too much contact with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  Were many of them Jews, or were they a real mixture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I only remember all these women in that huge <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> and then in the morning, the men would come and say, “Well, it’s time to get up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And again, most of the journey was fairly vague. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Obviously, it was quite uneventful, but this Margot and I became good friends and remained in touch with one another for a couple of years afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So, the 10 days -- after the 10 days passed, we approached <span class="DLF">New York harbor</span> and I knew my father’s oldest brother and his wife would meet us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Now --
QUESTION:  Di -- Well, did you s -- You’d come into <span class="DLF">New York harbor</span> where you’d see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Yeah, I saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Would you -- Where would you --
ANSWER:  Well, I was quite impressed and overwhelmed and I saw the <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> and I found it all to be very, very interesting, but of course, I was also very frightened and intimidated by it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So, we were standing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top deck</span> and I recognized my father’s brother, because he looked exactly like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Of course, I had seen photographs and incidentally, the family, after they heard that we survived the war, they sprang into action and send us lots of care packages, together with clothes, together with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And my uncle’s son was in the American army and visited us there, and I think I may have mentioned that. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">That was quite wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So --
QUESTION:  How long would they have gone not knowing whether you were all right or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  For the duration of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Oh, no --
QUESTION:  For several years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  My -- My parents managed to get word to them through the Red Cross in -- in sort of code language that -- letting them know that we -- we were all right, that we were not deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They did --
QUESTION:  In hiding --
ANSWER:  Yeah, well, they didn’t know that, but they knew we did not -- we were not sent away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And after the war was over, the son who was in the American army found us and that was a beautiful -- that was one of these memorable incidents, which I think I spoke about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  You spoke of -- tell me about it again, that’s --
ANSWER:  That was so lovely, because we were staying in <span class="INT_SPACE">makeshift quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I think we had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And my father was taking a walk on a Sunday morning, or whatever and, you know, we were surrounded by a lot of the Canadians who had liberated us, so -- and they were very nice and they would always bring us food and -- and good things to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So, my father was taking this walk and he sees a soldier, thinking 1t was another Canadian. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">The soldier looked at him and smiled, my father smiled, and must have made a little chit chat with him and suddenly the soldier said, “Well, Uncle Max, don’t you recognize me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And my father looked at him and recognized him because he had a little scar here where a chicken had once attacked him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  By his eyebrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Yes, and it was his nephew Martin and he took him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with him and I remember I was so embarrassed because I was still wearing my -- my slip, and I ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And he says -- he spent the day with us and told us about the family and he was also saying, you should -- I should come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And it was really a wonderful get together and I think he came back once or twice more, when he was on leave, so that was a big -- wonderful, big thing and we connected again. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Anyhow, when I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I saw them standing there, there were also some others, and then | realized they were my mother’s cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And of course, because of our being together so much, I had a very good knowledge of who was what and what they looked like, practically down to their size and shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  More information than they had, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  Right, exactly, and they too, were standing there and they were all frantically waving and then I got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and after I went through the immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And Margot was -- must have been met by someone, too, and then I met them and it was very emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">My uncle was crying and my aunt was crying and then it was my mother’s cousin and her husband and an aunt who were also there. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And we first went to someone’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was my aunt’s sister, where we were probably given a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And then we drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in my -- what I thought, my uncle’s enormous, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I was really awed by all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , by all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">It was just vast, 1t was very impressive as well as intimidating. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But what was more intimidating -- when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , we didn’t immediately go to my uncle’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we went to my aunt, that was my father’s older sister, with whom I was supposed to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And we get into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- she was a remarkable lady, my Aunt Eva, and -- by the way, they all spoke German, of course, and English, but my German was almost nonexistent, because I remembered a little bit from my grandmother, who spoke German, but I always spoke Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So my German was not very good, but I managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And my English was fairly poor, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So I get -- I arrive in my aunt’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was full of people -- well, they wanted to all be there and give me a big welcome and there were -- there was another aunt and her husband and lots of cousins and cousins children. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It was really overwhelming and I was very, very intimidated and frightened and then my cousin, who was my aunt’s daughter still living with her, could see that I was close to tears, and she said to me, “Come with me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I -- There is some mail here for you from -- I think from friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And I remember she took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she gave me a banana. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I looked at that mail -- I think I’m getting very sentimental about it, and there were letters from all my friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, oh, you must be in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> now and how wonderful and how anxious they are to hear from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But it was very smart of my cousin to have done that, to have removed me from all these people that were sort of standing over me and wanting to know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So, she must have gone back into the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and told them to disperse. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And th-they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And then, eventually, it was just my cousin, her name was Erma and my aunt and I, who were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And well, I -- they said I have to share the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> with my aunt and my cousin, cause my aunt was a widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">She came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with her two daughters, she was widowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And she had a fairly big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but she rented <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So the three of us

<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  Be kind, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Most of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They were very wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  But your links -- your letters back to your parents and friends would be what really kept you going, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  I don’t know if that’s correct, if that really kept me going. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I think the -- probably, yes, it could be that kept me going and thinking also, well, I only have to stay a year, I will be able to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">That’s -- I think was the key to it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">In the meantime, my aunt had decided to really bring Susie into American life and started to teach me the right things to say in English, thank you, you’re welcome and so forth and so on and you have to be more assertive and you shouldn’t be so shy and we have to make friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And she was -- I think she probably was at -- with me and for me at the right time. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And after the summer was over, she enrolled me in the <span class="BUILDING">local high school</span> and this is what I think is interesting, because I was 16 and I -- she managed to place me in the 11th grade, which I could never have been in, had I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So I realized, well, that was good, because that would mean I would graduate at age 18, as all normal children would. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Had I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I would have probably been 20 or 21 before I would have gotten that diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And she took me to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I remember very well and she took me to the counselor and she said, “She is supposed to get the easiest classes, because her English 1s very poor.” </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And the counselor was very understanding and said, “There are lots of,” -- nots lots of, “there are a number of other immigrant children and don’t worry, we’ll take care of her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And -- And she had a young girl go with me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because after -- I didn’t know my way and she was also the daughter of immigrants and they all -- the -- the -- the German Jewish immigrants, they stuck very much together. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, this young woman, Ellen, took me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And when I came on the first day, the counselor said, “You know, there is a young girl here who speaks Dutch.” </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Well, I thought I’d died and landed in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And he introduced me to the girl who was really from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but she had spent the war years with her family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bangkok</span> and was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">Dutch school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And in -- her name was Marion. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And, incidentally, Marion was my first friend and she still is my very dearest friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">She still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and we see each other, oh, at least once or twice a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And she and I became inseparable and that was very, very good for both of us, because she was shy and I was shy and we did not fit in too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">When -- Neither were we too comfortable with our American peer group. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We did meet also, some other young immigrant girls and became friends with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And slowly, we developed a -- a nice group. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">As a matter of fact, we even had a little social group, boy - girl, which would meet every weekend and we’d dance and have a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And my Aunt Eva was always prodding, “Now you have to do this and you have to do that and you have to become more social.” </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I was still homesick, but I think it star -- oh, and a big event was, after I was perhaps a month or two, they said, we will call your parents and you know, making a transoceanic call at that time was a big event and I called and talked to my mother and father and of course it was bittersweet, because after I hung up I felt worse, I think, than I did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But, I thought that was too very wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">In any case, life at Aunt Eva’s was very, very good because she took such a tremendous interest in me and tried to get me socially -- emotionally, socially and intellectually up to snuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">No -- No small task. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Susie Schwarz. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">This is tape number two, side B.
ANSWER:  Well, life at Aunt Eva’s was quite good and I think I benefited from it very, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I remember when I got my first report card and I got a near failing grade in French, she marched herself to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and said to the French teacher, “That won’t do, she is not going to accept that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And transferred me out of the French class, into a German class, which was very smart, because of course I did very well there and it helped my -- my German. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So -- But I could not stay at Aunt Eva, because her married daughter had to move back in, because they were going to remodel a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then I was shipped off to my Uncle Meyer, who was my father’s oldest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">That was the father of my cousin Martin. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">There, I was not that happy, because Uncle Meyer’s wife, whereas I’m sure she was happy to take me, was not used to having a young girl around and was accepting of having me there, but did not like -- did -- was not as encouraging as Aunt Eva, ergo, she did not like it when I would invite people over and --

<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  But my friendships stayed the same, but life at my Uncle Meyer and Aunt Ada’s was not quite as wonderful as life at Aunt Eva, although I continued to see Aunt Eva all the time, but I had to stay there, because -- so, after the year was over, my mother came, with the idea to take me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And at that point, I was quite well settled, very happy, oh, and I had gotten babysitting job, so I learned how wonderful it is to make money, 50 cents an hour babysitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Every Saturday I would babysit and that was a pretty good feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">However, Uncle Meyer made me turn most of the money over. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Later on -- And I resented it, he only allowed me to keep a small amount -- and much later on, I learned that he had put that money in an account for me, but he didn’t say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So, the year was over, my mother came with the idea of taking me back and at that point, I think -- there were two reasons, I -- I felt very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I liked <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I liked my life and my Uncle Meyer and Aunt Eva and Aunt Hunny, they all said, “We think your parents should come here and it would be much better,” and they were -- they were very close, th-the siblings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  And that had been their plan a-all along, [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So, my mother came, and I let it be known I was not going back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Well, do you remember what it was like, the reunion with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  Well, I was very happy that she came, but there were -- there were some things in -- you know, she -- the first thing she saw, I had very bad acne and said, “Well, why isn’t anything being done about that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="548">She was a little bit critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But I was happy to see her, but I think I was very ambivalent. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Well, here she is and she wants to take me back, and here she 1s and the first thing, she was saying, “Well, you need to do something about this and that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It was a mix -- mixed thing, and I think I let it be known very early on that I wanted to stay and -- and she must have been agreeable to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So, she stayed, I believe, for three or four months and went back without me and I continued doing what I did, living with Uncle Meyer and Aunt Ada, babysitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">As a matter of fact, I think I even got an office job at that time, because I took a commercial course in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , knowing full well that I could not qualify for higher level courses, not having had any preparation whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So, in ‘49, my father came and that was also the time I was due to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , so he was there for my graduation, which was very important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And I was so happy to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And --
QUESTION:  That must have been -- he must have been so moved and proud himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  Oh, he was, yes, he was moved, A, to see me and me doing as well as I was and in particular to seeing his -- his siblings, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He hadn’t seen them since the mid - 30’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And they enveloped him, they just didn’t want to let him go, and he didn’t go, he stayed, and must have said to my mother that he was not going to come back and that she should close up, finish up, whatever, and come, which she then did, in 1950, but -- so, he stayed for one year with my uncle, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And that was wonderful and he and I actually became very close, because, remember I said I was very, very close to my mother, very attached to her, but at -- that year was very good for my father and me and we really bonded and I think it was very wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So, I graduated in ‘49 and I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And, interestingly, I went to work for a physician, who was there for -- he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and he was working on the book of diseases of the -- I don’t know what it was, lung disease or stomach disease and I was doing some work for him at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hopkins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And he and his wife were awfully nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">They didn’t have children and they sort of adopted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They were very interested and very helpful and he said, “You know what, I think you need to go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I said, “I don’t think I can make it, because I don’t have the c- credentials.” </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And he said, “We’ll help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And I said, “And I don’t have the money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And he said, “We’ ll fund you, and I want you to discuss it with your family.” </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But the family felt I should not accept it, it was too much of a responsibility and a burden, which, in retrospect was a bad mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And I stayed with that man, I think, for a year or so, and

<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  It was. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I think that was one of the biggest mistakes that could have been made. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">My unc -- My family, I think they were not academically oriented and I think that’s sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And my father was not strong enough, I think, either, to make a case for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">My uncle was very, very strong and he felt it’s better if I continue to help support, go to work, and if I wanted to take night courses, which I did for awhile, I could, but he was -- there was no encouragement, and --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It would have been different if you had been a boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Would you have been --
ANSWER:  Not necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I don’t think -- I think it was not a sexist thing, no, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So, when I declined, the doctor was very disappointed, but he said he understood and that was that and I was crushed. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I think, if I had been stronger or more willful, I could have probably made a case for putting myself through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but -- I don’t know why I didn’t, but I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And then, in 1950, my mother came and she went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">She had never worked in her life and she went to work 1n a <span class="BUILDING">slipcover factory</span> , where she did piecework. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And she immediately said, well the harder she worked and the longer she worked, the more money she had and she worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And my father worked 1n -- well, it was an installment business, clothing and things like that, not very challenging. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So, all three of us worked, my father, my mother and I. I worked in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , for a small <span class="BUILDING">Jewish department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And then -- And my mother was very unhappy the first few years she was here, she was utterly miserable and very homesick for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and threatened to go back, but my father did -- also did not want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I didn’t want to go back, so she stayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  Two against one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Yes, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">She stayed and as time went on, I -- I continued to take a lot of courses, either at the <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> , or at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hopkins</span> , where I went at night and took English and literature and history. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I don’t know why I never signed up for a credit or a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But I was --
QUESTION:  Nobody there to push you --
ANSWER:  Nobody to push me --
QUESTION:  -- to encourage, I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  -- it’s -- it’s really -- if I -- I -- and it used to bother me in my younger -- not at that time, but much later years, that I felt deprived from the point of view of intellectual challenges and education, as I thought education should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So I did very -- a lot to educate myself and I think I did quite adequately. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But what I really would have liked, I did not get and I think part of it is I wasn’t encouraged and the other part of it is, I probably wasn’t motivated enough, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, there’s -- you can’t put a blame on anything, or anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And -- But I worked hard and then I got a job at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> , also in a secretarial area and I was promoted and became supervisor of their <span class="BUILDING">outpatient clinic</span> , and that was very nice work and very challenging and interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I developed quite a few friendships, that was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And met a young man who was not Jewish and thought that he was the right one, became engaged to him and then shortly -- much later found out that he, too, was a little anti-Semitic and broke off the engagement. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And --

ANSWER:  In the -- As to the Dutch -- the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I lived, <span class="REGION">eastern Holland</span> , and a fairly isolated <span class="REGION">area</span> I would call it, there were quite a number of people that did save -- that did take in Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Some for mercenary reasons, because I had heard of cases where, money gone, you’re gone now, too and that happened, but I don’t know how many instances there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I did hear about it, but all in all, after the war, or not even after the war, in recent years I learned that the Dutch percentage -- the Dutch people were not as helpful or as cooperative with respect to saving Jews, as some of the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> did, but even some <span class="REGION">eastern European countries</span> had a higher rate, shall we call it, of having saved or managed to help Jews, than the Dutch did. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And part of 1t may have been the government, because when the war broke out, the queen hotfooted it over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the Princess Julianna and her children went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I think Prince Bernard served 1n the -- in the English army or some -- in the Dutch division, I think, of the English army, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">But, articles have said, or books have said, that Queen He -- Wilhelmina could have done more to help her Jewish compatriots than she did and apparently, according to literature, she had sort of said, yes, it’s too bad what’s happening, but has not made a real tremendous effort to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And perhaps that set the tone, I don’t know, but the NSB in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , the Dutch Nazi party, was quite active and again, more people could have been helped than were helped, as compared to the French, who had a higher record of having saved people. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Course, the Danes were amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="839"><span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Holland came out very low on the list and I can’t -- I don’t know why.</span></p>

ANSWER:  [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  Yeah, exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Well, it’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">He lived next door and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us were other people and they had a little girl who must have been my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And shortly after the war broke out, perhaps a year after it, all of a sudden, the child was no longer allowed to play with me and then we learned that the father had joined the NSB. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Now, Mr. Fisher, that policeman next door to us -- he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , interestingly -- he had told us, he said, “Watch out for the neighbor across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , he joined the party.” </span><span class="sentence" id="848">He -- He was just a totally unprejudiced man, as was a neighbor two <span class="DLF">doors</span> further down, who was also a low level official in the local government, who was also very pro-Jewish and also very interested in us and incidentally, I think that he too knew -- yeah, he knew we were going into hiding so he es -- he -- he was very helpful and very well aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So there you have two people who were helpful -- didn’t put their life on the line, but at the same time, did not hesitate to have commerce with us, which is -- which was very brave in later times, when we were no longer supposed to be associating with non-Jewish people and they -- they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Their daughter, incidentally, still lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and has remained a good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So, it -- I -- I don’t know and I also don’t know in general what the - what the beliefs in -- of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I knew there were quite an few NSB, but others, who were sort of invisible and I don’t know what -- what -- what their beliefs were or what their support was for one or the other.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  -- but, I wonder if you’ve thought much about that suitability, compatibility?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  Well, I th -- Compatibility, it’s interesting, because in a way, we came from opposite backgrounds and opposite everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">What we had in common is, we were raised in the same <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we spoke the same language and we were both Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">We had survived the Holocaust, and that’s another topic that I want to address brief -- albeit briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Yes, survive the Holocaust we did, but I never considered myself a survivor as I do consider those people that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and my husband feels very much the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I wish there were another word for it, becau -- in a way, it’s a misnomer. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Perhaps it should be called, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivor, versus a hidden person or -- there must be another word for it, because I think what we went through was a snap, honestly, compared to what people suffered in all the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And my husband feels very strongly about that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">That people such as we, or some of the people that he has seen on tape because of his volunteer work that he does in the oral history, are not really that much related to the -- should not really be pegged as survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They may have played a role of sorts, but it’s -- the people that survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> should be in a category all to themselves, that’s really, I think, an important thing to know -- to be aware of, because they are unique, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">What I think is very sad, though, 1s, with all that has happened, with the awareness, with the education, with the -- the Schindler’s List, etcetera, etcetera, man’s inhumanity to man continues. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So what has -- what has history taught us? </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">This I find very disturbing and very shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I mean, if you think about <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , it’s frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So, have we not learned anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I guess not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  We have to keep -- keep telling the story and re-reminding ourselves and each other and that’s -- that’s so -- analogous, because they’re people just like us, enjoying the same way of life and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But telling the story over and over, of course, is good and having the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is more than good. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">It’s a wonderful, educational thing and I think the more <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> are created, the better it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And I think people are very keen on learning about it, so long term, I guess it will -- hopefully it will have some sort of positive effect on people, but -- at least over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">It’s an eye opener for many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I see people going in and out of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and if you look at their expressions they are quite shocked and astonished and it’s very difficult for them and for the children it’s very good to learn about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">That’s one of the reasons I felt -- when my grandson wanted me to go to his <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="880">But I don’t know how much of this education is being spread in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , given the fact that so many atrocities are still taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  And you know -- We know about them instantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">As they happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And that’s -- That makes it all the more shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So, I don’t know what the world will look like, 10 - 20 - 30 years from now, but I hope some of these <span class="DLF">killing fields</span> will -- will be gone.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER:  I would think it’s not a phase. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I would hope it is not a phase and I would think that the institution and the message are what -- something that will endure, because there will always be other generations with some curiosity about what was, just like there 1s still a curiosity about the Civil War, or any of these events that have happened in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I think this will continue to be of the same interest as time goes on, I would hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I think so, because as long as the textbooks and the -- the educators show that this was an important part of history, the likes of these <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> will continue to be of interest to the- to the public, I guess -- I hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  I wonder to what extent your own experiences have had an impact on your -- the position you’ve taken as a -- an American citizen in dealing even with -- we were speaking of the -- the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Do you think that in all these cases -- I’m thinking of the -- all the things that have happened historically since you came here, do you want to comment on your perspective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  Too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Too many things have happened since I came here, and the <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> and the African wars and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Remember when, in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , when there were all these problems, I kept saying, “Well, history 1s repeating itself, because the world 1s standing by and nothing --” and I felt so impotent, in -- in some ways I felt as if I should pack up and go and do something, knowing fully well, what can I do there? </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And then I s - chide myself or deride myself and say, “Well, if -- that’s not the right attitude to take, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">If you feel that strongly, you ought to go and do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">You are no better than people were at that time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So, I get very enraged, and very frustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Obviously, other than giving some financial help, I didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And when I look on the television screen and I see what’s going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , I feel the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Well, why isn’t our government more active and why -- and yes, you can write letters to your congresspeople and we do, when we feel the need, but that’s where our involvement then ends and in some ways, it’s not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I get this -- this -- this feeling of indignation, how dare people be this way, still, after all that has happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And I sometimes think we as a nation ought to get more involved in it, but it doesn’t always happen that way.</span></p>

QUESTION:  This is an continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Susie Schwarz. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">This is tape number four, side A. Tell me about how much of your experiences you shared with your children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Well, as I started to say, this is interesting, because when my husband and I first met, of course we talked about our backgrounds and what happened to him, what happened to me and in general, and very much aware of each of our histories. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And then we married and we really never talked about it any more -- very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Perhaps alluded to it here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And then the children came, Tanya first, in ‘57 and David in 1960 and I think neither one of us ever really made it a point to -- to sit down and say, “Well, you want to know about what happened to us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We may have touched it, we may have talked about it here and there, but not in depth. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And I think, as we got older, as the -- as we were less involved in the children’s lives, namely once they were out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and out on their own, if you will, I think much later we started to think more about it and to discuss it more. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And even, you know, going more into details of what happened to us, particularly in my case, because my husband was always much more reluctant to talk about it because, you know, his parents, of course, had a very horrible ending. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And, as we sometimes said, he never really had a chance to grieve for them and it was always a little difficult for him to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And as time went on, it wasn’t as if we were hiding anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">We answered and they knew I was in hiding and where I was in hiding and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But I think 1t became very much topic A after I -- after we got involved with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and after I gave my testimony and after my t -- my tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And I think then, we started to talk much more about what was than we did in the earlier years. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And I think part of it -- I really wasn’t deliberate -- I think 1t was more we were very much engaged in working, bringing up children and making a life and did not really dwell on what was. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I think, as we got older, we thought back, more about what happened and it’s a reminiscence, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And again, as I said, the tape was sort of a -- a final presentation to them, as to the what and the whereabouts -- the wheres. Also, my sister-in-law in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> just recently sent a little praysee on their trip from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="929">She wrote it in Dutch and my husband 1s going to translate it, also, again, for all the children to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But all this interestingly, happened really in our later lives and not early on and I think there’s a good reason for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  How did you come to give testimony at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Did they contact you or did you get in touch with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">ANSWER:  I got in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">As a matter of fact, my cardiologist, his -- what was to be his daughter-in-law, worked at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and my cardiologist, I -- I had told him where -- where I had been in the war and he told me to contact her or I contacted her, I don’t remember, but that’s how I made contact with them regarding the testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">QUESTION:  And would you comment on what it’s meant to you and your husband to volunteer at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  Interestingly, my husband -- we were invited to the opening of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and he did not want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">It was difficult for him emotionally and then I went and toured the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and I thought it was very well done, but he did not go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I took my mother, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And he told me he couldn’t, it was too difficult and too emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And then one day, I was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and when I came back he said, “I went to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And he was really very impressed and he had spoken to someone in the <span class="BUILDING">photo lab</span> -- I don’t know how -- and coincidentally, she -- this lady in the <span class="BUILDING">photo lab</span> -- can’t think of her name right now, Genya -- Genya Marcon was her name, had -- her family name was the same as someone that my husband used to know in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and talked to her and she said, “Why don’t you go and volunteer?” </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And that’s how he became and he’s been very involved and very, very much engaged and then drew me in, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">But it took a little while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  Yes, I’m -- I’m sorry not to be asking him about this, but I wonder if that is something that he feels he’s doing as a tribute to his parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I would think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">It’s a -- Probably, yes, that is so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  I wonder if you have any thoughts, too, about the ways in which the -- all the Holocaust survivors, of the camps and of -- those who were in hiding, or -- those who came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , do you have any thoughts about ways in which they have enriched life in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Wh-What they have given to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">ANSWER:  That’s difficult to answer, because I have not really thought about that, so it w -- it’s going to be a pretty superficial answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">There are many of them who have made significant contributions to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">As witnessed by the people that are very actively involved there, Mr. Lerner, and -- Lehrman, I mean, Miles Lehrman and so forth and Benjamin Neeves. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">They have done wonderful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And I’m sure there are very many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I want to add, though, something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">There 1s the hidden child -- it’s -- what 1s it called? </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Fonde -- no, not. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">The hidden child -- can’t think of the other word. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">It’s a group of surviving children that were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I have been -- They were in touch with me, I know someone who’s involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">and I don’t very much believe in all these organized, you know, th-the children of survivors and the hidden children, how helpful that is or how meaningful all that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I guess, to join together and to discuss what -- what happened, I don’t think it’s very productive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  You mentioned speaking at your grandson’s <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  Do you do much speaking about your experience, or was that a rare occasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  No, that was -- No, ac -- as a matter of fact, it was at my grandson’s <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I met a lady who belongs to a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and she asked me would I speak to her church group and I did and as a matter of fact, the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> group was so awfully nice, they send a donation to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , which was lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Other than that, no, I haven’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  I want to ask you what -- what your views are on this quotation, it’s just something that I think the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> thought was of interest and it’s Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, “This is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.” </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And that’s something that Netanyahu had said in ceremonies after a -- after the march to remember the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">QUESTION:  But, do you have any comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">ANSWER:  I think that’s hard to comment on. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">In other words, what he’s saying 1s really it’s the Jewish faith and in a way the Jews bonding, sticking together, that helps us survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I think the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has been -- the creation of the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has been a very important milestone for the Jews and I think without the existence of the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I think we would be far more vulnerable than we are now. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Desperate you mean, while in hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Really, I’m interested in knowing the -- since there were times when, in your testimony, you really are using a -- a real sense of humor that perhaps your mother used.</span></p>

QUESTION:  -- showing that humor was keeping you going, but I wondered what the funniest times were and the most -- and the most dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">The most anguishing or desperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">ANSWER:  Well, I think the most desperate or anguishing times was when I was fully aware how very ill I was and it was frightening, because my hearing at that time was impaired. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">So that was very, very -- and -- and the frustration of being indoors all the time was very, very difficult, where I couldn’t see the sunshine and had a real longing for the sunshine. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And the happy time was that one and only time when they carried me out into the <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> and I did see the sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Funny, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">There was not very much that was funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">The mice procreating above us, maybe it was funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Oh no, no I can’t say there was anything really light, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And anguishing, yes, to me there was always a certain fear, notwithstanding my mothers constant optimism, are we going to get out of here and what’s going to happen once we get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">No, I can’t really address that too well.</span></p>
