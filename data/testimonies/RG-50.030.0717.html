<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  That seems very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">How did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">You must have been precocious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  That happened because my father was an omnivorous reader, and according to my mother, he taught started teaching me to read when I was three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was six. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">In those days <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Memphis</span> did not have <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , and so I started in the first grade when I was six. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I stayed in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for about two days and someone came and took me to another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and that was the second grade, and I stayed there about a week and then they took me to another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and that was the third grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the third grade.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Were you the stringer for the paper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  I was a stringer for the paper at 14 cents a column inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I had been a copy boy there for two summers, and the man who really gave me the idea of going to <span class="BUILDING">Ole Miss</span> was what they called a tristate editor, and he knew that I needed the money to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and he said, "If you go to <span class="BUILDING">Ole Miss</span> , you can have the stringer job." </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And he said, "I'll see that you get enough published to pay your way through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  What are the kinds of stories you wrote about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  You know, everything that goes on on a <span class="BUILDING">college campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">There would be lecturers who would come on the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> , and I would write a story that said that so and so was going to come and speak on such and such a date, and then that would be three or four weeks or three or four months before he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And then the day before, I would say do another little story and say he was going to be here tomorrow, and then I would do a story on what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So I sort of worked out the system, and most of that stuff got published, but the I guess the outstanding accomplishment was I did an interview of Faulkner, and when Faulkner returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> , I had the first interview with him, and it was I was asked to do a rewrite for the AP and also for the book section of the New York Herald Tribune.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And how did you find Faulkner?</span></p>

QUESTION:  And what were some of your assignments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Well, I I didn't cover anything until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I did we did news shows, | 5minute news on, you know, 12, three, six, nine, and fiveminute summaries at the start of every hour, and I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rewrite desk</span> to update those news shows.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  For me, it was you know, Europe if you were in I spent most of my time was in we were holed up in an <span class="REGION">area</span> on the <span class="DLF">border</span> where <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> come together. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And Atkinson does a great job of talking about that battle, which was one of the decisive battles of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And so the people lived fairly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">You know, they didn't have any there seemed to be enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">You know, the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we were in had not been devastated at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We were based in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , actually, about two miles from the front, and, you know, it was you about we were in front of the artillery, and so you had to get used to the sound of shells going over your head every night, but the people, you know, learned to live, you know, without recreational stuff, without amusements. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">You know, people hadn't had any new clothes for five or six years, so but the worst part of it was when on living things was watching how the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So you were assigned to cover the trial in the fall of 1945, and you moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  And tell us a little bit about how you wanted to cover the trial? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Did you did they give you any direction of what they wanted or did you have a lot of leeway on your own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Well, the direction I got was we want a straightforward account of what went on in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And your audiences, you have two principal audiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">One were the million or so American soldiers who were still in Europe; the other was Englishspeaking Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And one of the reasons for that was that there were surveys of where people Germans got their news and credibility were done, and the American Forces Network was the most credible news source in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for several years after the war, and the reason for it 1s, is the Germans felt that the Americans would not lie to their own troops.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Were there other any of the other defendants did any of the other defendants, you know, stick out in your mind at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Yes, but not very positively. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Most of them were well, practically all of them were depressed; particularly the military people. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Schacht, who was a finance minister and who was one of the three people acquitted, he was upbeat most of the time; obviously a very bright guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I'd say about half of them, you know, you would think was a plumber or something like that, you know, read water meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Of course, you know, Streicher was you know, he was sort of the scum of the earth not only to the to the people in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , but also to his fellow defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They the military people, you know I think, you know, acted like they they were order takers, they weren't going to challenge anybody, they were interested in their military careers. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They of course, Hess was sort of, you know, the light comedy touch, you know, sort of like crazy like a fox, you know, and he would carry on with little antics every now and then.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  You watched this in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> as it unfolded?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  Put yourself back at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Did you feel like you were watching a process that was fair, that seemed like you know, it may not have been perfect justice, but that rough justice was being done at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="360">What was your feeling at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  It was as close as you could come when the winner tries the loser. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And one of the questions that we asked Jackson was, "Why do you say that they are being given a fair trial?" </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And he went into great detail and says, you know, "We let them choose their own lawyers, and so if they wanted a Nazi for a lawyer, we approved that. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We paid the lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We gave them a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work and fitted it out for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We gave them copies of all the documents before we introduced them." </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You know, they did whatever they possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And, also, the the judge Judge they could object, and a lot of times the objections were sustained. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So I think it came as close as you could get to, you know, AngloSaxon type justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And the other thing about it that I think speaks in favor of what of a fair trial is there was a good deal of variation in the sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You know, there was 11, I think, of the 20
QUESTION:  And some were acquitted, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  And some were acquitted, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Three were acquitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Three were acquitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">One of them should never have been tried, Fritzsche, who was Goebbels' he was like the fourth ranked guy under Goebbels, but but there was none of the rest of them were left, so he he got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And so they and the judges, you know, saw that, you know, he was not really part of the group, so he was only about 38 years old, too, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  Tell us, by the way, speaking of media people, Streicher was obviously convicted and later hung.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Hung, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  What were your impressions of Streicher? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He comes across as a thug.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Oh, a slob. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">You know, just an uncouth individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  But did it seem to you that he was on trial, too, even though he was, you know, a you know, a publisher, he wasn't actually a part of the Nazi apparatus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  You know, he had very little power, practically no power, as far as running the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s concerned, but but I think I think it was great symbolism to to include him, because he was so, you know you know, back during that period there was hardly a week or two or three weeks that you didn't read about Streicher in the American press as to remarks that he had made or things that he had done, antiSemitic stuff, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  So he was really conditioning the public for
ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And soI I would assume that Streicher was there more for public relations purposes than the fact that he was one of the perpetrators of starting the war or even what he did during the war, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He but
QUESTION:  Do you were you at all censored by your by your bosses or did they let you pretty much write what you want?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  You know, as I've gotten older, the greatest surprise that I think as I've thought over this thing, and particularly the way the information policy of the Army is now, is that literally no one read my script before it went on the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I read it, and I showed it to my announcer, and every now and then they would say, you know, you are tangling me up in the stuff and could I make the changes, but and and no I| never got a negative comment from any of my chain of command. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">In fact, the only time I ever heard from them was when I got the Jackson thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  When you really kind of explained how Jackson had messed up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">When when we got the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It was a

<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  Tell us about that interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  Well, Jackson at the beginning made a statement that he didn't want to make a circus out of this, and that he didn't want any second guessing on each day's testimony, so he, in effect, you know, admonished his own staff, and he said he would give no interviews until the trial was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I knew his press secretary or got to know him, Gordon Dean, and I said you know, I tried to get through that, and he said, "No, the boss doesn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He is afraid if he does something with you, that will break the <span class="DLF">line</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And one night I got the idea that the approach should be that he owes it to the soldiers who are still there to tell them what he is trying to do, and I told called my went up to see my friend and told him, and and he went and told Jackson what my argument was, and he says, you know, they are talking about people who fought this war who some of them, many of them injured, all of them lost friends, and then Jackson agreed, but he wanted the questions submitted in advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And he did not change and he didn't change the questions either. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He
QUESTION:  Do you recall the most do you recall any of the most interesting comments he made that stuck with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Well, I guess the most quotable thing was that, "These people are being tried not because they lost the war, but because they started the war." </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And it was the interview was more scholarly than sensational.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  But was it the only interview that Jackson gave during the trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Yeah, uhhuh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  That was a big scoop then.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I, like a lot of other people, was fairly naive about this, and, you know, the world was hungry for someone to assure them that there are not going to be any wars like this anymore, and, of course, you know, that was Roosevelt's <span class="DLF">line</span> , you know, in getting the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> off the ground, and one of the things that Nocera pointed out

<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  And that's why what brought
QUESTION:  Yeah, this brought this all in play.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  this interest up, huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Otherwise, it was still sitting on a shelf. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Joe said that I guess the way he put it is that there was a refreshing naivety and that reflected world the sentiments of a lot of people in my scripts is one of the reasons he did the article, and the but, you know, in talking to reporters, I didn't find much cynicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  So people thought this would be a huge advance in
ANSWER:  Well, let me put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Among the British and the Americans, that's the only ones that could communicate with the media, I didn't find much cynicism in the thing, in the feelings about the trial.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  And so but but I I think the trial was as fair as it could be when the winning nation won, and I don't think any other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> would have gone as far as the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Let me just think of one or two other questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">One thing about your reports is that they are really written in a very plain way, not a lot of highfalutin language. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">It felt to me you were almost trying to talk to the GI.</span></p>
