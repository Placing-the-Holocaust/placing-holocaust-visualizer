<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  I might have heard the name but I think I was protected from hearing too much being afraid about too much, because again the atmosphere and the thought must have been at that time that it wasn’t going to be so easy for the Nazis to overtake Europe the way they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I’m sure that that’s what was on their minds because I mean we really ran the day they attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
