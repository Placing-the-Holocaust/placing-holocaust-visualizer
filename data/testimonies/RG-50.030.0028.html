<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Tomasz Blatt, B-L-A-T-T. And I'm born in 1927 in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  What's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  In a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">This is in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin district</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Tell me about your parents and what they did, and your childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a very interesting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because...uh...it's a hundred percent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">In...uh...in 1870...uh...a Polish aristocrat...uh...did recetve a permit to build a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And...uh...in a place close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Wieprz</span> , he established this...uh...Jewish...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">In the beginning, there were about four <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> according the... the what I discovered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ....
QUESTION:  Tom, what we need to do...excuse me...we need less of the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We need your story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Okay....It's a typical Jewish town, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> , hundred percent Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The Christian population lived around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , on the foothills. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">About 3,000 Jews used to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Uh...And the...this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was built in a valley surrounded by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> , or <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and this the Germans later used for the purpose which we will come to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We had..uh...one <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> and about three, four Beis Medresh [NB: Beth Midrash]. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Very deeply orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">As a matter of fact, I remember there was next to it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Zamo __, and one Saturday, some Jewish or free...they called them "free thinkers" did come with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">On top of it they were without caps, without a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I remember the...half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they chased them out with sticks and with stones because they come on a Saturday and...um... Saturday, Friday in the evening and the next day Saturday, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was quiet because it was a holy day, like nobody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> except in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I remember Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">You could feel it in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">You could see the people moving by to...to the Beis Medresh...or to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">It was deeply orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">There were a few which did try...uh...to reach out. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">For instance, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> everyone had a name; on top of it, he had a special name given. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">For example, if he does...he didn't have a leg, they called him [Leme Yoine (ph)]. [</span><span class="sentence" id="29">Yoine (ph)]| was his name, because uh...my father, why I'm telling him was because my father was already what you call "free thinker." </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He did try to move out from the orthodox ways, so they called him [Leibele Goy (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It was..., my [NB: his] first name was [Leibele (ph)], he was Goy because he did...uh...smoke cigarettes sometimes Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They did know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">You can't sneak...you can't smoke cigarettes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> but when the...the shutters in the the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> weren't closed, all the peoples in the neighbor did know that my dad was smoking cigarettes Saturday because of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I remember mine...if you talk about my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I will tell you a story which will give you an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Uh...For example, my father had a Polish friend, a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He send him out to buy pork meat usual; because...uh...nobody could see my dad be going into...uh...to buy pork meat, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So he sent this Christian friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I...once I remember and my father told me, "Try it." </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I tried it and I liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But in that time they used to live in so-called, in a [Urisha (ph)|. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">You know what [Urisha (ph)] is? [</span><span class="sentence" id="43">Urisha (ph)] is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it was built maybe 50, 80 years ago by my grand, grand, grandparents and later when the children did get grandchildren, they get married and so on, they divided this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So...uh...finally when I...was already over there, when I was about 10 years old, this whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was divided with partitions that everybody could hear everybody across the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So mine...mine aunt did hear me...did hear the conversation with my dad and she noticed by listening in that time, I'm eating pork meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So what...the next thing I remember she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> where my father lived and said, "Tom." "</span><span class="sentence" id="47">Toivi," not "Tom." </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Not Tom. "</span><span class="sentence" id="49">Toivi, you eat pork meat?" </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I said, "Yes, Mimi, I ate." "</span><span class="sentence" id="51">You know what [Streicher’ (ph)] is?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="52">Yes, I know what [Streicher (ph)] is." "</span><span class="sentence" id="53">You will go to <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I know about <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> because my uncle told me stories, how they burn people and everything else. "</span><span class="sentence" id="55">Promise me, you wouldn't eat any more." </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So I say I wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I was such...so scared about <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> and everything else that immediately...1t was a shock to me I remember...what I remember is I...I was in a high fever and laid down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> and my whole head was just like a...like a <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I was sick for about two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They called the doctor and that time, you know, the doctor...doctors used to come to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he said, "Give him aspirin. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I don't see anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And finally when my Mimi did come to visit me, and I remember the first thing what I ask her was, "Mimi, will I go to <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And she probably understood what the problem is; that I simply, that I'm that scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I'm sick from being scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And she said, "Oh, Toivi, you know, don't worry because when your Bar Mitzvah will come, God will forgive you everything." </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Now, this...this had a fourfold effect because I wasn't afraid anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was Okay, but I again I did...when mine...the next time my dad did ask me if you want a piece of pork meat, I said "Yes," because anyway, in about two, three years God will forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So anyway, I just tell you a little picture it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Some people they tried to get out from the circle of...uh... orthodox behavior, but it was very...it was trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But...I otherwise, actually it was a deeply Jewish town.... uh ...with a very big respect for the Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The Rabbi was our authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And...uh...Friday, with the shochet and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And so it was 'til 1939, when the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Uh...I remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...you know, we didn't have...uh... radios in that time, so any news 'He may be using the Yiddish word "treife" here. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">was...uh...transmitted by person who had a big...uh...drum...uh...Jewish guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">His name was [Hydel (ph)], and he did go to the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and drummed up until all the people had come together, and now he said, "Hello, hello. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">This is the news..." and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He did say that a war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Hitler invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and a mobilization is in order and...uh...he was the latest news from the Burgermeister's office, <span class="BUILDING">Mayor's office</span> , I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And he advised to glue in strips of paper on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> so they shouldn't shatter if the bombs fall down, and that was the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So people start to pick up newspapers, cut it in strips, and glue in and some people did prepare dry bread; and so it was in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And later I remember <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I remember <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish plane</span> shot down, and the next I remember my family was moving out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , hiding in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We were afraid that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> will be bombed because there was a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">military factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> uh producing material for fortification purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So I went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panska- Dolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Over there, I remember Polish soldiers and I remember when the news arrived that the Soviet Union is fighting against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I remember the speech from the Polish officer, that they have, they are stabbed in the back by the Soviet soldiers and now they will fight to the last drop of blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And ...uh...later I remember the rumor, the Germans are coming, and now we are a group of people about 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We don't know what to do, scared in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The young people say, "Oh, we will run away from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We are going across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> Bug to the Russians." </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The older people, mine parents included...my father, "No, we're going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Of course, they're anti-Semites, but they're also people." </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I remember we split then. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It was in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I remember the stars and could be about maybe 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, like a...like a film, like a movie, we departed. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And the sons did walk to the east, and some parents did go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And I went back with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> and now...uh.. (chuckle) interesting news. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The Germans are leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So I said, "The Germans are leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I didn't see a German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I must see a German soldier." </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I went down looking for a German soldier. "</span><span class="sentence" id="107">Oh, there're two German soldiers still in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> buying bread." </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and I seen in front of them two German soldiers with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because German is pretty close to Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my language. (</span><span class="sentence" id="110">laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We did talk a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I Yiddish and they're German. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There's nothing wrong with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Uh...A day later the Russians arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later did...did come to agreement about the...the <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> , and they moved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And the Russians arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they were in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The Russians are leaving again. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The Germans are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So again what should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">My mother told my father, "Listen, Let go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I know Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Let go out from here." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And my father said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Actually he bought a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And later he said, "No, I was born here. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I could die here." </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way a Polish patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's army...uh...uh...in the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He was a invalid. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And...uh...which was, you know, a very horrible in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So he...and he said, no, he will stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He was born here and he...he could die here. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And he stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And this was...and this sealed our future, our destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close by the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I was a child 12 years old, but I felt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The Russians left and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> was a no-man's land. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">No Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">No Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The Germans did come. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before Izbica in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krasnystaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Izbica was nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So two...the third night, sitting in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I hear a big explosion. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And suddenly — screaming, yelling, "What's happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="151">A group of Jews stood on the <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And they killed a few and they wounded a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So we start to be terrorized by the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So people were scared to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there's another legation did form, a Jewish delegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Still I remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">By the way, this 1s the same, this 1s my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat...I1 shouldn't eat unkosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Under...under her leadership, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krasnystaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Actually, to invite Germans to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> because it...1t is no law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> and we are afraid and that they must come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So Germans did come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> to protect the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">No, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There were simple Wehrmacht soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local command...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the <span class="DLF">streets</span> so they were pretty quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I remember a...kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It...1t was rather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There were two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Ludwig Klein and Karl Engels. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They both committed suicide in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> after the war, being 1n <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Well, anyway, these two SS were a terror in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five, ten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized, finally, that we have no rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And many times we wished that if the first Germans which arrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it would be a blessing because everybody would escape with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">In the beginning! </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So...now it was too late, and we were in a trap. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">There were still families. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was possible to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">There were...uh...there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and Jews were forced to go to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">In the beginning, they were forced to work on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> from 8 o'clock in the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Later, as I said, there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> where they went out for a month or for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Later they...they were exchanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">New Jews did come and they were let <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Uh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans 1n that time established Jewish Councils, so-called "Judenrat." </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And through the Judenrat, they were able to execute their orders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and the Judenrat also after a month or so sent new people. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The old ones...the first ones should be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So it wasn't a order. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for one month to the labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the poor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But as the time progressed, it was worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We heard about beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We heard about torture, and people refused to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">In that time the first so-called "Aktions" happened. "</span><span class="sentence" id="197">Aktion" is a roundup. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It started with roundups to the labor camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They would come in the morning and told the Jewish Council to deliver 500 men or 200 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their own police, they started indiscrimate to go from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , beat, shot... Ukrainians, which worked with the Nazis together. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And they...they caught...they simple caught people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> 'til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away.</span></p>

So in that time, I was already in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I was, of course, 12, 13 years old, 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So my father looked for protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">What about my family in that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">My mother, of course, was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">My father lost his business, He had from before, as a legionnaire, he had a <span class="BUILDING">liquor store</span> business, so-called "monopol koncesja" in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , uh...as a veteran from the legionnaires. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Lost my [NB: his] business, but still he was able to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He was very well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He has done some business with the Polish farmer, even if 1t was illegal; but he did look to protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So he made a deal with a Pole of German origin, Mr. [Platow (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Mr. [Platow (ph)] had a <span class="BUILDING">blacksmith shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He made with him a deal that I will work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So I should be employed in case the Germans are looking unemployed, because 1n the beginning they took so-called unemployed Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I went to work about 8 o'clock in the morning til 5:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was hard work because in that time we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lathe</span> , I remember; and the lathe, it's not like now--you put in an electric motor, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lathe</span> is running. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I did need to move everything by myself, and many times I thought I...I will collapse but then my boss said, "You turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Just turn." </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And I thought I...I must turn because this is my protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I must turn the wheel even if I wasn't able to breath anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But I managed. (</span><span class="sentence" id="223">Pause) When the Gestapo arrived, they went...they had two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they...and they need a repair shop. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So they went to another mechanic, blacksmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">His name was [Solecky (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> were over there, always, for the night to be cleaned or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was over there...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Gestapo car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And once in the evening I was going by, the boss, Mr. [Solecky (ph)] from this...uh...<span class="BUILDING">repair shop</span> told me, "Tom, would you like to help me? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put together a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So I said, "Okay, I will just tell my dad." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Told my dad that I will be a whole night working in Mr. [Solecky's (ph)... will call it from now on "<span class="INT_SPACE">garage</span> ," because Americans are familiar with what a...what a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And while I was working next day, he said...[Solecky (ph)]..."Listen, why don't you work with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Leave Mr. [Platow (ph)|. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Come to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I thought it was a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">First of all, I will be protected by Gestapo, clean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> , and I agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And from that time on, I started to work...uh...for Mr. [Solecky (ph)] and it was dangerous because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> of the Gestapo need to be cleaned, you know, spotless. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And I worked very hard and I done a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And as I see it now, it was a good choice because later when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> did come, I was protected practically... practically the last minute, and I was able to see how <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is sinking down, myself being protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I didn't need to hide like another people that hide in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I've seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Suddenly, transports arrived from...uh...Pozna_...from west...from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...Pozna_, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ko _o</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Konin</span> , and lot of Jews arrived; we divided...the Judenrat divided the people to different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and that time I did get very close with...uh...[Jussik Bresler (ph)|, who was...uh...a dentist's son from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ko _o.</span> In our <span class="NPIP">place</span> used to live a man, his name was Kohn, with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Once I remember...it was the evening...I still remember my mother standing close...close to the <span class="DLF">window</span> with Mr. Kohn and his wife, and discussing a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I listen: "gassing people, gassing...."" And my mother I remember saying, "It's impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It's a fantasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Can't be." </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So a lot of time parents don't even realize how much children could listen in, pretending doing something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">What I understood, and later I find out more is Miss [Mrs.] Kohn, received a letter from her son in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ko_o</span> , which was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ko_o</span> , that in a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chelmno</span> , they're gassing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He wrote about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But, as I said, it was dismissed. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">By the way, her son who wrote the letter survived and he lives in [Holland (ph)], in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And I later talked to him when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I was in the South, reminding him about this letter he wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Anyway, so this was a bad signal, but later quiet down. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">At least I didn't hear...at least I didn't hear anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But once was some "Akcja." </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The SS arrived in the morning, did...uh...asked the Judenrat to deliver 2,000 people to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And the Judenrat did go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and delivered, but a lot of people already were afraid about the torture, about the beating, and hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So the Nazis themselves start to look for them and collected them in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">After such a "Aktion," after the...uh...the desired amount of Jews were concentrated in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , everybody else could go out and uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was like normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The people were over there, then later they were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , there were already <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> for them loaded and taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Like they took them away before to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zamo</span> _...was a labor...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , [Mokre Zdanow (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They left. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But usual, in a case like this, they took away some family...family members, and the family which was left usual...usually sent some Poles, Christian Pole, a friend, to go after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to see the destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And so after this transport left, some people...Polish people went after them with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> or with...uh...either way, with another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> tracing this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">The same night...uh...I...a day later, I remember I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I heard some knocking in the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It was already after the curfew...curfew time. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But nevertheless, many times I did sneak out after curfew time. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But I hear some knocking, and as I go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and...uh...there was a knock like I had...uh when I went to my friend [Jussik (ph)], I knock the same way...three times long and three times short it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I recognize as my friend [Jussik (ph)] from...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ko_o</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , go out, sneak out, you know, because Jews are not allowed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and hidden behind this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I say...I noticed [Jussik (ph)] standing by. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I said, "[Jussik (ph)|, What's the urgency? </span><span class="sentence" id="275">What is so..." "Tom, I must tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Tom, you remember [Ruza (ph)]?" </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I said, "Yes." "</span><span class="sentence" id="278">She was taken before yesterday." "</span><span class="sentence" id="279">Yes." "</span><span class="sentence" id="280">She's dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I mean, "What do you mean, she's dead?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="282">I mean...you remember the transport which left with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...the last transport of 2,000 Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">All of them are dead." "</span><span class="sentence" id="284">What do you mean, all of them are dead?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="285">Tom, you don't know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He said, "There's a <span class="NPIP">place</span> call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , and I have a friend who just come back and he told me that all the Jews, not only from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> , every day, thousands of them are coming in to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Belzec</span> , and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> should be overflowing but nobody comes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Only people are going in. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And night time is a big fire, and they're killing people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">They say by elect...electrocuting them." </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Because in the beginning, they didn't know the method. "</span><span class="sentence" id="293">But they're killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I said, "[Jussik (ph)|, you are dreaming." "</span><span class="sentence" id="295">That's what I want to tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="296">He left. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I didn't tell this my parents because I didn't want to scare them. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But the next time the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> did know, that there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , 35 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> , and they're killing people over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So everybody start to build <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Before the...we had <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> before too, but they were primitive, only to...to hide themself in case they..they want to take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But now the stake was life, and they...they start to build very elaborate <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">In that time the Mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...in that time was a German Mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a Polish German, "Volks..."--so-called "Volksdeutsch." </span><span class="sentence" id="303">He decided to move to better <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Before the war, he did live in some kind dingy, a little rundown <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but now he want a better <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so he moved exactly in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we....we did live. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It was like...you would call it in...n <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> like on the ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it was really a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where few families lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So he did become our...our neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">In this particular <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was a long <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...we...we had about eight families, but by him moving in, we did join the same <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> over this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , part was on his...on top of his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and part of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so what we have done...we ask a mason to take a part of this <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , build a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We made a hiding place over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The <span class="DLF">entrance</span> was from...was from our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They build a little <span class="DLF">opening</span> , a little <span class="DLF">door</span> , maybe three feet by two. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We squeezed in, went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , and we were actually on...on Mr. Schultz, which was the mayor, on his..on his <span class="REGION">property</span> ; so when we put against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> our little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> , it did cover the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and we were safe, and this was our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The drawback was that we did need a guy from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to...but this I have done because when was...I was already protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I told you which way. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So I have done run back to the...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Anyway, now the second Akcja did come, and the third. </span><span class="sentence" id="318"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Soon transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> .... Why I say <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> separate and <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> separate? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Because the Czech Jews, they're completely different...uh...than the Slovakian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The Slovakian Jews looked more like the Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Same type of people; and... uh...(pause) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ...some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">In...from, practically, from a low population, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> did grow to about 15, 20 thousand; so it was even people...even the <span class="DLF">street</span> was ...were too many people to move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So again a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akcja</span> and again did go down to 10,000...
QUESTION:  What is your point? </span><span class="sentence" id="325">What.... Describe you...

class="sentence" id="1751">We weren't able...but what's happened over there...there were about 150 Jewish girls working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , sorting some stuff.

id="1758">In the beginning, it was very nice because I had a method. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">I noticed that the Germans like clean people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">They like people going straight fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">The moment you see a run..rundown Jews, broken-down Jew, they killing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">So always I kept myself clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">I put even my pants under me when I slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">They should be ironed with my body, straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">I didn't need to do this too because clothing, I could go any day change shoes or shirts or... because I was working sorting, and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">But I always looked a open <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">So I did go to work for the Waldkommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">The foreman...the Kapo, was a good acquaintance of mine, and I asked him and he said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">You could come me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">We cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">Later, ...uh...they're building a <span class="DLF">road</span> over there. </span><span

and...uh...and this was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work because this German didn't beat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">So anyway, going farther...so my way of surviving was stay away from the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">If you sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , take a...a...a...a...<span class="NPIP">place</span> far away from the <span class="DLF">entrance door</span> , right in the corner, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> even if you need to crawl...to...to it's difficult to get up, do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">Keep yourself clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">Keep yourself straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">You see a German, go somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">And...uh...and...uh... a lot of miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">And this way I was existing Sobibor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">Uh...What also it was, I made a deal with a guy who sorted luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">Because you sort <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> , you could make <span class="DLF">labyrinths</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">And I was sorting food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">So I told him, "Listen, I bring you some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">You let me rest in your <span class="DLF">labyrinth</span> to eat." </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">So I was ...uh...taking a few canned food to him, and I was eating; and later he was happy and I was happy because I was always tired and sleepy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">Over there was a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">I will skip little stories like this, but why I mention about this guy because he will come up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">Once in the middle of the night, my friend shaking, "Tom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">What's happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">What's happened, he...he had a big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">And the one <span class="NPIP">part</span> was...uh...uh...sectioned off for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">And the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open, and I heard some talking <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , so I did get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">I've seen something is going on, and I did go to my friend in the [bank (ph)] kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">And I go to him, and it was dark in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> because what I know in which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> he 1s, and I tell him, "Listen, Shmufel], Hear what's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">Something...something 1s happening here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">So instead to answer me, he hit me in my face with a...with something...some kind of metal, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">So I thought "If he knows and he doesn't care, it's okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">So the next day there were rumors that the Kapos did plan to escape, but more people find out and they did...uh...want to go too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">Anyway, I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">But again, by working...in that time I used to sort clothing...uh...I've seen the whole Kapos, a whole group of kapos being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">So I was wondering what's happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">But again, a little bit later, I see this Berliner, the guy who used to...uh...the Lager, he used to sort <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> , has the uniform of the head Kapo, and did become the head Kapo and it was obvious that he did betray the action. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">But to make it short again, we killed him later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">Before we made the revolt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">He was...uh...killed by...uh... prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1810">QUESTION:  Tell us about the revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1811">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">Now, the situation was, of course, we were sure we will die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">When...uh...even if the...the war would stop right now and then the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> could be free, we will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">So this was a terrible feeling, there's no way out for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">Everybody did want to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">I think that whatever I was thinking to run away always, everybody had in his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">Although some people were resigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">They were Orthodox Jews, which nevertheless, even with this terrible situation did pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">I remember Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">And they did fast, and they did say all the prayers and...uh...they were very observant Jews, and they still had their trust in God and their tradition everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">Now, there always was...I wouldn't say organization...there were a few people, influenced people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> ...respected people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">It was a Hazzan, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">I don't remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">And was Leon Feldhandler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">His father was a Rabbi and he was...actually he was a member of the Judenrat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zolkiewka</span> , in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">And there were some talks...talks about the revolt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">I was close to Feldhandler because he was a friend of my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">He was in Izbica ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica ghetto</span> in the time when I escaped to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stryy</span> , and they caught me in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">But 1t wasn't until a transport from the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">When the <span class="REGION">Eastern Front</span> was coming nearer, the Germans eliminated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">And that time they took all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> and they brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">I mean not all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">A lot were killed on the spot, but a lot of...some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">And in that...1n this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> they included quite a few Jewish prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">Soviet prisoners of war, Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">Because they recognized as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">In that time we had a lot of work and the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">Unfortunately, for them they picked up a few former POWS trained in the art of fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">Former soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">And they picked up a man called Pechersky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">He was a officer in the Soviet Army, and ...to work with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">Pretty soon, Leon Feldhandler recognized this potential material and he contacted, Leon Feldhandler, and Leon Feldhandler contacted Sasha Pechersky and...uh...again, I don't want to dwell much on it, they formed a organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">From that time on some concrete things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">I find out about a week before about the revolt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">Uh... That time I was working as a Feuermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">How did I come to be...to get this job? </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">Feuermann is like firemeister...master. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">All the documents, heaps of documents, passports, pictures, books, soiled clothing was burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">While they were burning it, when I was sorting, I put the papers in a big blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">Later with the blanket was still full, I put it on my shoulder and take it to the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">Taking it to the fire, I started to get familiar with the guy working over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">Did bring him some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">And slowly by slowly, I start to helping him; and later, when they built a bigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , I was working over there as a steady personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">My idea was to work in a...to be enclosed, out of the view from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">I could see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">They can't see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">From the <span class="DLF">window</span> , I was able to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">But once I wasn't able and there was a terrible beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">But anyway, so...they planned to kill a German in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">So this way...but I did need to be contacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">Otherwise, I would...some stranger comes into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I would chase him out, being afraid myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">So he calls me in the evening and tells me, "Toivi, I must tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">I know you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">I know your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">I will tell you something, but keep your mouth shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">We need your <span class="NPIP">place</span> to kill a German." </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">I was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">Later, I find out about what's happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">And I was informed on the purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">I...I understood that something is going on, and I was informed about Sasha. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">Especially I was a guy...I was a guy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> which always did run around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">You know, I didn't keep in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">I was always hyper and would just run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">I did want to know everything like I would be...go out and I'd write book, which I've done, actually. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1876">laughing) I was always a very...boy who...I want to know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">So in this way I did become, I was involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">So I know the first plan was...there were different plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">The first plan was to dig a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">blacksmith shop</span> through the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> to <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">But when they analyzed it, it's did come out that we need to work many, many days, nights to dispose of this very dangerous dispose of the soil. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">They need to find a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">And when...let's assume everything is okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">Six hundred people should go through the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> single file without quarrel will take a whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">Isn't practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">They threw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">The next one was to poison...to kill all the Nazis while they're in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , because there was a group of young kids like me, they called "putzers,” which each morning 4 o'clock they're allowed to go out from the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to go to the Germans and while they are in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , clean their shoes, clean their belts and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">This time to smuggle in instead a such a young boy should go a little bit older, at night and kill in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and get their weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">But they did...they discon...they disregarded because they didn't...they weren't able to depend on young people doing such an important job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">Anyway, a plan was accepted...the final plan, to kill all the Germans in a matter of one hour, between four and five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">We based our success on the German punctuality...punctuality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">Discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">And the plan was that the heads of the workshops because besides the people working in conjunction of the extermination, there were workshops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">Tailors, shoemakers working for the Germans only, because there was...so much... they had a labor force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">Why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">So they established a few small workshops for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">And always a German have something...made something for himself, a uniform or shoes; or the...heads of the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> should make appointments with the Germans to come on that particular day, October 13, for appointments between 4 and 5 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">And over there there would be some people which will... which will kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">So I know about this plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">And this should happen between 4 and 5, and the whole lager should look normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">We should not...we should not use the weapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">I remember I was in that time waiting and <span class="BUILDING">mine fire place</span> ...1n <span class="NPIP">mine place</span> ...where I burned ...where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">I pushed all these papers against the <span class="DLF">window</span> so nobody should be able to look in because in, because in the sides when did people did bring me documents, papers, we threw 1n in the sides, and the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> was in the middle, and I just later burn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">So anyway was a <span class="DLF">window</span> so I blocked the <span class="DLF">window</span> and was waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">And..uh...now I see a group...uh ... because they were divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">The organization had about six fighting groups of three people and located in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> waiting for the Germans to be lured over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">So I see the group 1s supposed to come to <span class="NPIP">mine place</span> coming to my direction, to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , but they're passing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">They're going in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">So I was panicky, but pretty soon a Jew called....from 6d_, Sender, comes to me and said, "Tom, they decide not to do anything to your <span class="NPIP">place</span> because the guard...the tower guard was very close." </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">I was very close to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and he could notice a German comes in, doesn't go out and could be suspicious. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1910">We rather...we'll kill him in the <span class="BUILDING">men's storeroom</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">Then he told me to go over there, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the <span class="DLF">gate</span> leading...connecting Lager | and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so- called four lagers, like 1, 2, 3 and 4. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lager 1</span> were the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they used to sleep and these <span class="BUILDING">workshop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">Lager 2 we sorted, and Lager 3 we did burn, and Lager 4, we were building something over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this <span class="DLF">gate</span> was very close to the <span class="BUILDING">storeroom</span> I just seen them both coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">He was called in..1n to try on a leather jacket, because it exactly his size. </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">And he did go in and suspected nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">While he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">This...the moment he was killed, he did come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming tn, the Jewish prisoner said, "Achtung!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">immediately. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1920">Attention." </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">And start attention, took this leather jacket and he immediately...he hold it for him and while he put in the hands in the leather jacket, his arms very immobilized like....like in a straight jacket, and he was killed with an ax and we had a first gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">I was scared up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">I remember when he was killed and the guy who killed him did come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">He's a little bit blood on his shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">He patted his pocket like to say, the gun is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">I...my whole ...[ wasn't scared any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">I did want only to know what will happen to me a half an hour later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">That I did want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">And I...I...I did know there's no way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">This 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">They killed...as long as we didn't kill the German, everything could be.... And later they called Beckman, and Beckman I remember he went to...to the <span class="DLF">door</span> over the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and like whatever feeling he did turn around and went back and they killed him anyway in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">And to make a long story...and I...and I at that point, I remember there was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">miners train</span> , for the miners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">Little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with a little electric engine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">And the German who was the head of this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which connected all the Lagers with Lager 3, was already killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">But inside I notice there's canned food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">So a few cans, put into my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">And I remember I had friend, Linda Karoten (ph), Linda ____.. And she said, "Tom, you're preparing like for a picnic." </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">And I said, "If we will survive we will need it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">And later [...[...] eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">I ran in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">I reminded him this, that he said I'm preparing like a picnic because we used it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">We're so hungry and I had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">Anyway, now I remember the foreman was a French Jew...Jacov Dunietz [NB: Joseph Dunietz], and the foreman from the group did come to me, "Tom, maybe you have some money?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">Because many times when I did burn in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> the soiled clothing...when the clothing was burned or books, some money did come through in the ashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">And when I cleaned the ashes, I find some gold always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">It did lose the luster, but it was not.... So...uh...he did know I could have it, so I did give him some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">And the Germans were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">Nobody did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">I was wondering that...this was like normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">First of all the Kapos...the Kapos which were...there were two Kapos in the organization...and they were instructed to use the whip to beat us like everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">And they have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">And I remember like every day, singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">We went back to Lager 1 for...uh...supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">And now the biggest shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">And this was I think was the...the most important ingredients of the success was so few people did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">There were...we were about 600 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">And this was the time before the roll call when we stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">Believe it or not, practically the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was still like every day standing in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">Maybe about 50 people were missing, the people which did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">But soon one told another one, "Listen, forget about supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">Something is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">Let us grab an ax. </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">Grab anything and be prepared." </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">Now the dangerous moment did come because up 'til now...the...the Germans were free to go and come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">Each German has a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">The sorters, where clothing was sorted, there was a German standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">But he was allowed to go for a cup of coffee or whatever he want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">And another German ...let say...from the shoe sorters, the place they sorted shoes, did come by and he didn't notice the German who's suppose to be by sorting clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">He wasn't suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">He thought, "Oh, maybe my friend went for a cup of coffee." </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">But now, 5:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">Well, the...the time did come close when all the Germans supposed to be in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , Lager Ein, to...they witnessed the roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">And now if a German is missing, they will look each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">So we did know that the crucial time is coming and... uh...uh...the <span class="DLF">line</span> in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> start to...to dwindle and I remember a shot and I remember Sasha Pechersky jumping on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">And why I...now...a one Kapo whistled a whistle, like for a...like for a roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">Normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">And made it a little bit earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">The original plan was actually to march...
QUESTION:  Stick with what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1979">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">The original plan was to march out to the <span class="DLF">front gate</span> , but we heard a shot and the plan was disregarded to march out to the <span class="DLF">front gate</span> because probably the...the guard wouldn't know what's happened and we could go too close, very close maybe to them also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">But I heard a shot, Sasha jumping on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and he start to talk, "Listen." </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">Something in this sense. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1983">Listen to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">I remember only one sentence from the whole talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">It was very short. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1986">The time did come that we will take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">We killed practical all the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">Now let's stood up and fight our way out." </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">In this sense...but the sentence I remember exactly what he said was: "If someone, if you will survive, he

a knife from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">It was easy to hide a knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">Was a knife somebody probably from some...somebody brought us...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> maybe a rabbi or so...or so, because had pearl handles and the on..on the handle was written Kusheshov Paisach (ph) [NB: Kosher for Pesach]. </span><span

id="2002">And while running through I know...I remember and on the left side, a Ukrainian guard with his rifle standing like that...like a...like a fixiated and just turning around himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">He could use the rifle and shot, but he was handling it like a stick, like somebody hold...hold a can...cane, and just turning around. </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">He didn't...he didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">And I was running to go with the people to the <span class="DLF">front gate</span> and half way I heard some whistles...shot was all the time, but I heard whistles like from bullets whistling and I noticed and I, on the left side behind a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> 1s a German with a machine gun shotting at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">And here two my friend fall down, another one third. </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">And I started to back up.

id="2010">And...uh... some way I find my way to a little <span class="DLF">gate</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> for the guards, because between the <span class="DLF">fences</span> guards were walking, this time empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">Probably I went into that <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">Luckily, I had behind myself...I left one <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> and another <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">Now I had only one <span

class="sentence" id="2022">He made a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in...1n the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">Now...but more and more people come and they don't wait in the <span class="DLF">line</span> when machine guns are shotting at us to go through the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">They start to climb on

of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">But actually, this saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">Because the first few went through I could see why the people is depending on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">The <span class="DLF">mines</span> exploding and bodies flowing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">And finally when...when everybody when through at least at that part of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and I can't go out...from ...from the <span class="DLF">fence</span> because the barbed wire did go in in the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">So I left my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">By the way, I had a leather coat from...I took it the last minute from the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="2033">Anyway, I just slid out from under my coat and start to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">I fall down a couple of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">I thought I'm shot and I wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">I start to run until I reached the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">Now, I'll really speed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">Come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">We are

about 50 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">The next day we met another 30 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">So, and I've seen that we are too many and must...something must be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">But...uh...we still kept together until one...until early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">I remember we stopped out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and Sasha said that we must go out to check where we are, and they need money. </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">So whoever had the money to give money to buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">And all the men with rifles did left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">Nine people with weapons left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2048">We were against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2049">We understood that something is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">Only Shlomo Szmajzner was left, only because the rest of us surrounded him that we must have a guy with a rifle left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">And he promised he will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">He did never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">I talked with him later after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">Or maybe I shouldn't go into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">He said when I met him that this was his soldier duty to go back to...to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">Anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">So when he left there was real tragedies because groups start to form. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">The weak people did want to go with the strong ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">And it was unforgettable...unforgettable scenes, which I won't even to go in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">Finally, I took two boys and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">Shmuel Wycen

id="2063">We eluded the...the Germans and we made it to mine hometown, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2064">Over there, I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will hide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">The two boys didn't want to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">They were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">But I left to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the evening, hoping that nobody will recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">It was sort of dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">I come to the Polish lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">She didn't want to hide me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2071">So I left back and told the guys, "Listen, it's no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">We must look for another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">But you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">Let go first eat. </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="2084">There's light. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">We go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">There's food on the

</span><span class="sentence" id="2089">Nobody answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">Finally, we go back to this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and start to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">We go back out again and finally, I see a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">We asked him, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">Come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">Where your father?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">And he comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">He recognized we are Jews. </span><span
