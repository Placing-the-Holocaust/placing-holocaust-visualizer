<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  And you had seen a lot, you were not a child any more, it seems.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So by accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So that's what | wanted to ask about. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You were 16 and this farmer asked you to start bringing things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  To deliver a message.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  And so at what point did you start to understand or think about or realize that you were part of this movement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  The moment he send me, when | took the message to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , | already understood that this is something, it's a new phase in my hiding, | had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And when | delivered the message, in that time, you see, every day you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It's like | was, was like a bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Every day you survived a new sight . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So when | was on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , | thought oh, maybe | should sleep here, it'll be another safe day. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So | went to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">| asked the farmer could | sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Oh, | don't want to go to make, back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , | am tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He said of course you can sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> night time, some people started to arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">About one o'clock, a group of about 25 people , And | was ascared they will recognize me as a Jew so | digged in deeper in the straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And they laid down, they relaxed. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And about two hours later, everybody left and the way | find out, from their conversation was they're going on to mine the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> someplace, not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So | understood, that I'm in the midst of a organization, | still didn't know what kind, but later, as you see, special once they did give me a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , with a lot of leaflets from the Polish government in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And | supposed to deliver packages of the leaflets certain safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So on that point | understood that they trust me already Thomas Blatt 4 July 26, 1996 Page 4 because | did know all the circuit we were delivering. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And | understood for who | am working. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Except that this Mr. Russelinski(ph) who was the head of the organization, who took me in to deliver the messages, he only was aware I'm Jewish, in the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Nobody else did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">As a matter of fact, the next day, when | was sleeping in this, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> | mentioned before, it was Sunday the next day and the farmer said, Tom, they called me Tolek(ph) in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , Tolek(ph) we are going to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> today and this farmer said, "Tolek, come to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , we are going to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Tolek, come to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So | said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="62">You see, | come, | don't come from an Orthodox family, but my old relatives were Orthodox and watched out for me | should learn the Torah and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My parents really didn't care much. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And | believed in God and to be a nice Jewish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">You should never go without a cap, you know, if you take down the cap, you should have a yarmulke. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And still, no matter what, after after everything else, | still felt uneasy taking down the hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Now they're going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , | was aware | must take down the hat and what makes it worse, you're going to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We went over there and they are taking down the caps, the farmers and there's a big cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And to take down in front of Jesus and the cross, | felt it's something terrible, |can'tdo. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Soldidn't touch my hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But the farmer looks at me and said, "Och, like a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And he, with his hand he and threw out my cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So | remember, but later when | was in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , pretending I'm praying, we prayed of course in Polish and | prayed in Yiddish and asked for forgiveness that | am praying in| achurch. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So now! </span><span class="sentence" id="75">don't mind, you know, it's different, but that time, my mind Thomas Blatt 9) July 26, 1996 Page 5 was set this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So | feel to do some kind, how do you say it in English, blasphemy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Blasphemy, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  So all these people that you worked with, the resistance, did not know you were Jewish and it was important not to tell them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was important not to tell them because the organization, we talk about a political organization, underground organization in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">One was called Akar(ph), AK and | know they killed the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , some Jews were members. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Mostly doctors and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So actually everything depends on the person, on the individual and if | was in this organization, maybe one wouldn't hurt me, but | bet there were some would hurt me badly would they find out I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">As a matter of fact my friend was hiding in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He attached himself to another organization, a leftist organization, where he should feel secure and he was killed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Because he was Jewish, so they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So it was dangerous to admit, so |, | looked like a little shygitz(ph), shygitz(ph) is in Yiddish, is a little Christian boy, barefoot and | was wearing, | remember, over, overhaul, you know and | didn't stood up as a Jew, my nose wasn't as big as is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">You know very younger, when you, when you, when you grow older the nose, first of all the nose is getting older too, longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">No, | was, | was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Thomas Blatt 6 July 26, 1996 Page 6
QUESTION:  And were there other Jewish young people or other Jewish people in the group? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Did you...
ANSWER:  In the organization, no, no, not in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Ohno, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There were living in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , some Jews, there were two girls working at maids to Christians and there were one Jewish girl which married a Christian in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and there was some Jews working as tailors, quietly, you Know this was 1944, when the Germans actually didn't dare to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> like he used to come years before. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">When they did arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> now, it's with big groups and very careful and soon and soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So it wasn't so dangerous to take in a Jew for , like it was, for example in 1942, '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">| talk about little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> far away where the partisans had the upper hand for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So some Jews were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , living half hidden, half open.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  But you stayed private about being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, in the partisans at least, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  And so did they feed you, did they give you a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, did they protect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  They didn't need to feed me or give me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, | mean in daytime mostly | was working with this farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But if there was, as it called, action, we did need to go someplace, they let me know, come here and there to assemble, to assemble part. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We went out to a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> or we had some meetings and so on, so on and daytime, even back to work, no one did know that we are farmers, although in daytime | used to deliver leaflets, | mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Ormessages. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But it wasn'ta group, we was always in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  But there were some that were like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Thomas Blatt 7 July 26, 1996 Page 7
ANSWER:  Yeah, but , they weren't always in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And every group had people which in daytime, every partisan group, resistance, had people in daytime were normal people and in nighttime they went for some actions, they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And some were always in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Actually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , It was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Mchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">M-c-h-y. This is the Polish spelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So a little while ago you said, then one day you met your first Russian soldier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  No then one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">This was in July and a German soldier arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And it was obvious that he, that he escaping and he told us that is an end to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was already July 1944 and us aware that the Germans are escaping, finally they arrived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And we have seen it, the older farmers left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and went uphill, for the prepared <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and dig outs and so on, <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But, | was without in a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and | didn't know what to do because they didn't let in strangers, the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And the farmer where | working as a cowhand, he was aware I'm Jewish and he was afraid to let me in the last minute, you know, never know what could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So! </span><span class="sentence" id="128">went down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and mingled with the Germans, they were on every, on every <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So anyway | went into a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> , picked up a cow and took the cow back uphill. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">On the way, a German soldier passed me and he was washing himself with, he was shaving himself actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And he offered me a cigarette, he talked with me a little bit and Thomas Blatt 8 July 26, 1996 Page 8 later | went down with the cow and to the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And so if somebody stops me, of course | would say | take care of the cow, this is only, you know, belonging. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So | felt a little bit safer, but later when the shooting is coming closer | was a little bit afraid and tried to get in, in a, you Know, when they cut the corn, they but it in kind of a, | call it bundle and they put the bundles together so if forms like a, like a <span class="BUILDING">Indian shed</span> , whatever would you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Anyway...

<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Rachel described this. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Sol was standing with him and told him, "Shloma, don't kill this girl, she is innocent.". </span><span class="sentence" id="511">She was my age.

"</span><span class="sentence" id="517">So, where do you have the money?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="518">Oh, we don't have any money." _" </span><span class="sentence" id="519">the money?" </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And finally, probably she was, | don't know, afraid that we will wait maybe longer, "I don't know," she did come, she did go to a, we did go to a, she took us to the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and there was a bunch of stones, a heap of stones laying. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">She moved away the stones, picked up a big pot with gold, with , with watches and diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And he said, "Okay, this is it" and he took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And the Russians took tt...

<p><span class="sentence" id="584">ANSWER:  No, when | arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I've done a mistake, when | was, when | arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , was there a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bernau(ph</span> ), suburb of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and | made a mistake, instead to go with the whole group, we would go, we went to a under organization, a refugee organization and they take care of them, food and everything else, | went by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">| always, | actual, up til now, | hate to go in organized groups, always, I'm individualistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">| went by myself, not realizing that in that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , there are no <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , everything is by food stamps and so on, soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So! </span><span class="sentence" id="588">was walking around, hungry, without a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, look into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and I've seen two Russian soldiers and, and two German girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And soldiers only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> left , | sit over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">One thing you could order without money was beer, so | ordered beer and later we talk Thomas Blatt 32 July 26, 1996 Page 32 with the Russians and | told the blonde girl that maybe she know where | could, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">She said yes she knows, a friend of hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So when they left, she took me, she knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , on the <span class="DLF">window</span> , to her friends <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she said, “Here's a gentleman that maybe you could keep him overnight." </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And they let me in, | slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">The next day, unexpectedly the same girl did come back and ask me if | slept good and something and she did help me with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">She was aware of some <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> where you could eat without food, only soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So anyway, to make a long story short, | was with her for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But later, a jealous, her boyfriend, the Russian officer arrested me, put me in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="979">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Put it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Actually it was always in my, in my subconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">It started again when the film did come out in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , The Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">When did come to Thomas Blatt 53 July 26, 1996 Page 53 interview me and | think this film was a breakthrough in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="984">From that time on they start to talk about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And | did go back to my manuscript.</span></p>
