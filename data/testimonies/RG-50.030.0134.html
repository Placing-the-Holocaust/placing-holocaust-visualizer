<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  The tape is rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Would you tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  I am Max Karl Liebmann.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Where were your born? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was--
ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , on September 3, 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents and your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My father was — had a -- was in his own business. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He and his brother had a textile representation business. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They represented a -- what is called here, a converter of textile goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">They had one of the largest -- or the largest European weaver of textile goods and before ’33 -- they also had some Czech clothes -- cloth firms, and eventually, after 1933, and a few other <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> which I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And after 1933, in particularly, after 1934, when my father's partner which was his brother had a stroke and could no longer work, my father remained with two companies which stayed with him until they could no longer employ him, due to Nazi legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Would -- did you remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> all this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> 'til I was deported in 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Tell me then about growing up in this family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- the first 10 years of your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  The first 10 years were very -- basically very uneventful. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I was told I grew in the midst of the inflation and my parents were middle or upper-middle class and my childhood was very uneventful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I went first in 1928, I started <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> for four years and then you switch to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">In 19 -- when I was about 8, in 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I started with cello lessons and in 1932, I switched from <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> to what was called <span class="BUILDING">Realgymnasium</span> ’. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The <span class="BUILDING">Realgymnasium</span> is something which I don't think we have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">You start -- in your first year, you start with Latin, then in the third year, you get, in addition to Latin, you get French and in the fourth year, in addition to Latin and French, we got English. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until I decided at the end of December 1937 that it makes no more sense for me to continue <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">When I quit <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was sent in the what was called Obertertia~. I would have had three more years to go to make -- to graduate, which was called in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> abitur’. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Obviously, everything changed with the advent of Hitler and I have memories that there were the emergency police running around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> because they were always demonstrations and counter-demonstrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> where I could watch this very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We were living on a fairly important <span class="DLF">thoroughfare</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> became more difficult with the advent of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think it was in the second or third grade of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- I was about 11 or 12 when the taunting started. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And it was harmless -- it wasn't badly meant, but it was grinding, because it went on and it went on and it went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So, in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went to, there was a custom that each -- each class every other year goes together into a <span class="BUILDING">youth hostel</span> for three days to play football -- to play soccer, and generally to have a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And I picked this particular time to have a fight with one of the guys who were taunting me and I beat him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I picked one I could handle. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And from that moment on, there was peace, not only for me, but also for my other three Jewish classmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We were four Jews in my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I had basically no problem with the exception of one altercation I had with a -- with my German professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He was a member of the party, if I remember correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He -- one day we had to write a paper about how we could contribute to the Four Year Plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">That was an economic plan which Goring" was supervising. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And when I got the paper back, I got a bad mark with a note that I must have copied this out of a newspaper or a magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So I didn't let this sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Challenged him to show me where I copied it from. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Unbeknownst to me, I used American style, “you're innocent until proven guilty.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And eventually he had to change the mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  At the end of December of 1937 we were only two Jewish boys left in my class and very few other Jews in the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I decided it made no sense to stay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I -- I knew I would never go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It became more and more difficult, so I told my parents, "Enough is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I want out." </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I started -- then we compromised and in the ' Liberal arts high school (German) * The sixth grade level in <span class="BUILDING">German Gymnasiums</span> (German) * High school graduation examination (German) * Hermann Goring beginning of 19-- immediately at the first few days of 1938, I went into a private, <span class="BUILDING">commercial language school</span> where I had French and I had English. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I learned German, steno’, just to keep me busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">After all, in 1930 -- at the beginning of °38, I was just 17 years old -- not -- no -- 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there until the famous Crystal Night® of 1938 which was the end of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and basically for all German-Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Can we slow down for just a minute?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  You talk about your experiences as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">What was your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> like in terms of Jewishness? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Was there observance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  We were not observant Jews in the -- 1n the sense that there was a <span class="BUILDING">kosher household</span> or any such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My father belonged to a Gesangsverien’, which is a singing organization which is very customary in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">This one happened to be the Jewish one. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And my father was a member of that Board of Directors since almost immediately after World War I. Incidentally, my father was a soldier in World War I and was a veteran of front service, which permitted me actually to stay -- to stay in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> as long as did, because I believe in 1936 or 1935 already, the children of non-veterans were legislated out of <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So, no we -- I mean we never -- my father also was a member of the legislative body of the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> so there was never a question of where we belonged or where we were, but we did not per se be practicing Jews that we went regularly to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I mean I was Bar Mitzvah, of course, my father would make an appearance as a member of the legislative counsel at least once a year in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on, on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I went a few — I went a number of times on Saturday morning more for social reasons than any other reasons -- we would meet with our friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And, of course, we had every Friday night, there were -- a different meal with the German version of challah which is called Berches*. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And so we were, of course -- obviously it was not a matter of denying that we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We were Jews, but there was no practice -- practicing Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We would not light a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> candles for Hanukkah or would have a Seder, not withstanding the fact that for- for these days, I always went to my uncle and my aunt, my -- the sister of my mother had no children of her own and until they immigrated in 1930 -- early in ‘34 to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , I was there on all these holidays like Pesach, etceteras, etceteras. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">° stenography ° Kristallnacht ’ glee club (German) * German-Jewish braided holiday bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">By November, then, of 1938, you were a young 17 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You were going into this special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> waiting for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">What happened as we -- I am sorry -- as we approach Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">No, that is okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Since my father was very active in -- in this what originally started out for 80 or 90 years as a singing organization, was converted in 1933 or 1934, into what was referred to as a Jewish cultural organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And since we were excluded from everything which had to do with culture, we had our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In addition to the cause which was a mixed choir, there was an orchestra added, and by the time I was 14 or 15, I was in the orchestra and we did all kinds of opera, opera performances, oratorios. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And all this, of course, stopped with the event in of -- at Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Incidentally my father at the time of Crystal Night was in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">His -- one of his companies where he was always the number one salesman, suggested to him since they couldn't employ him anymore in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , if he wouldn’t want to try to build an existence in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We'll come back to this a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Let's do it chron--chronologically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Just a point of confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You used the word “converted” to a Jewish cultural organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I wonder if that's what you meant or if you where thinking of the Jewish ethical society.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I didn't mean the conversion as a -- in a religious sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Okay, I mean, to be clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  I meant it, it used to be a it used to be simply an organization where an orchestra was -- the local orchestra was hired and they would sing concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Now we added on a an orchestra and it became a self-sustaining, Jewish cultural organization, where culture was continued parallel to whatever we were able to do with restrictions obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We were not permitted to do German composers. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We had to restrict ourselves to either foreign composers or Jewish composers so we could not perform after 1934, I think, or ?</span><span class="sentence" id="102">35 -- Bach was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But we did do Orpheus and Eurydice, by Gluck’. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We were permitted to do an Offenbach” opera -- operetta. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We did Judas, Judas Maccabaeus, by Handel"’ and things like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  What happened as we moved toward Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Crystal Night, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">This is a <span class="BUILDING">commercial school</span> where I went like on every day, and it seems to be I walked on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Why I walked and didn't use a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , I cannot remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I did not really see much of mobs because I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at eight o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I saw something which struck me funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I didn't give it a second thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I ” Christoph Willibald Gluck oY acques (nee Jacob) Offenbach " George Frideric Handel went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and around nine or nine-thirty, the telephone I was called by the directress and was told, "Your mother has called. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You should leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span> immediately, and you should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and you should wait in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> for your cousin who will come separately and you will spend the day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">When I called <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to find out what was going on, I was told, "Don't ask so many stupid questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Just go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and call me tonight." </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> being only 10 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> , I walked myself over from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to the. . </span><span class="sentence" id="119"><span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> which was only a 10 minute walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And on the way I started to realize what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> being thrown out of <span class="DLF">windows</span> and people being arrested, but since I didn't look Jewish in their sense, nobody bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , bought a ticket to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , and 15 minutes later was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> where I met my cousin and we spent the day in the famous <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Heidelberg woods</span> , walking and there seems to be a -- a faint memory that we were supposed to touch base with a -- I don't know if it was a far relative of my grandmother or just friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">In any case they were of Czech nationality and we were supposed to touch base there to see what was going on and I arranged -- we agreed with my cousin that this would take place around -- after four o’clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So we walked 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and my cousin got very nervous and wanted to come down much earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">However, I said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We, we Said -- we agreed it was four o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We are not going to change the date.” </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Which was very fortunate because by the time I -- we got there or shortly after four o'clock, the man had been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">If we would have gotten there earlier, we would have probably been arrested to. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So we continued walking around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and when I called my mother at seven o’clock, she said she thinks the worst is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We should come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Now let me add there that in the beginning of 1938, since nobody knew how long we would have to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or would be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my father was gone and there was no income coming we had given up our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and had moved in with my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">My grandmother happened to be a French citizen which is a story in itself which came about shortly after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">She wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> 's twin <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludwigshafen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  You mean after World War I?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  After World War I. And when she came -- she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and when she came to the rail to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugwigshafen</span> , the French had blocked passage for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They did this on occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And so my Grandmother descended from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and was trying to force her way across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She called the watch commander and explained to him that she is born before the Franco-Prussian War in 1970'* in the <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> and '* The interviewee later corrects this date to 1870. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">therefore, by rights, she 1s French. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the man happened to be a lawyer and explained to her that in order to become a French citizen again, she would simply have to apply for what was called reinstatement of some kind -- I forgot the French word right now -- which she did . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Therefore my Grandmother in 1920 or ‘21 -- my mother always told the stories at -- during World War I, there were no political discussion in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because my grandmother, not withstanding the fact that her future son-in-law was a German soldier and her husband was a German -- was always a French patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So my Grandmother then applied for reinstatement and became a French citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So in 1938, on Crystal Night day, which was November 10th, when the destruction took place, my mother called the <span class="BUILDING">French consulate</span> when the SA’ started to smash in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back loft</span> where my grandmother had <span class="INT_SPACE">commercial space</span> rented out to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish store</span> who sold glass -- glass fixtures, electrical glass fixtures. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And this was smashed to millions of bits and when my mother called -- my mother called the <span class="BUILDING">French Consulate</span> because after all the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was in the name of my grandmother -- was a large apartment- in order to protect the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And within five or 10 minutes an SA man in uniform came, stopped the carnage in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back loft</span> and was posted there all day long in order to protect my grandfather's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> who was after all a French citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in, in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Without a doubt the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was destroyed, but I do remember that one or two days after the 10th of November, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludwigshafen</span> to help a former member of the orchestra straighten out her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was in, 1n pitiful shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">After Crystal Night 1938, I spent 1939 basically doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was nothing I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I was reading a book a day and then war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Now I think we should come back to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">In March of 1938, my father went to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and after a few months was able to start selling his company's goods again which did not sit too well with the German competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And when they figured out in 1939 who was behind their loss of business which went to another <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> , they managed to get my father expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My father went, I think in May, from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">In fact, my mother visited him in August of 1939 in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">She had a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We all had passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And at that time was so convinced that nobody would be insane enough to start another war -- this was in August of 1939 -- that she came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and instead of calling me who also had a passport to join her in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , so the family would have been reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> second my father illegally went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ventimiglia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> , across <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> -- on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> around the <span class="DLF">border</span> and, of course, did all the things other people did who came in illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">He was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a few weeks, and then he lived precariously in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> until he was accidentally until he ran into a German patrol accidentally in, in 1944, and was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">My mother came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and on first of September 1939, World War Two broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The first thing which happened was that we were called to a <span class="BUILDING">Wehrmacht” office</span> where we were mustered out of the army for being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">In other words, we could not serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We were not -- it was, it was not dignified for Jews to serve in the German, army. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Sturmabteilung [storm troopers] (German) '* Armed forces (German)
QUESTION:  Had he been admitted to the German army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We had not been admitted to the German army, but we were mobilized like everybody else and had to present ourself in a separate little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and these soldiers were very nice about it and -- but of course, we, we were not mobilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Then in -- that was in the middle of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Shortly after that, I was required to perform how would you call this, harvesting service in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That was east of Frank--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was very far away in those days, it was a trip overnight through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oder</span> , and I was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We were quartered in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where you normally would have weddings. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">There were they installed platforms where we could sleep on. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There were about 30 or 40 young people of Jewish -- German Jews, and we helped farmers harvest the sugar beets and potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I don't know how much we harvested, but I can assure you every time I hit a -- I made an effort to hit into every potato and every sugar beet I had to dig out. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And what was traumatic about this was not that we had to do this, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there's a law, on the -- was on the books, probably still on the books -- that when you move from one <span class="NPIP">location</span> to the other, you have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">local police precinct</span> and notify them you are going from here to there, so that your records are maintained and, of course, my mother probably worried that if, when I would -- when I come back, there would be trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But when we were there six weeks and when I came back, there was no trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I just registered again I am back. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">That was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Then my mother was able to arrange that in on January the third, I think, or second, immediately after the first of the year in -- of 1940, I started to work at the Hilfsverein'’. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The Hilfsverein was an organization set up by the National Representation of German Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to assist people with their immigration problems and since <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was still out of the war at that time, there was -- Jews still could immigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">German Jews were still able to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> so we had a very busy <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I was working there as a volun--volunteer secretary until we were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And in order to be able to work there, I had to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to present myself to the chief of this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">In the Jewish Reichsvertretung’’. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">You know the German Jews had their own organization who represented the Jews with the vis a vis the government and I traveled at night from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , presented myself in the morning to the chief -- was a man with a beard whose name I don't remember anymore -- and traveled back the same night from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- the next, next night from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> which was not very pleasant because my mother decided I should travel second class. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It would be more '° Hilfsverein der Deutschen Juden [German Jews’ Aid Society](German) ‘6 Reichsvertretung der Juden in <span class="COUNTRY">Deutschland</span> [Reich Representation of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> |(German) comfortable since I would not sleep for two nights and all I had in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> were either officers of the army or SS" officers who were traveling — 1t wasn't very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But you know I did what my father always did when my father was traveling, as long as he was traveling and working until the end of 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He always had Nazi newspapers, so I did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I had Nazi newspapers and they left, no--nobody bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So nothing much happened in 1940, until on October 21st around 10 o'clock the telephone ran in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and the chief of my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was at the same time the representative of the Mannheim Jewish community with regard to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So at 10 o'clock around the telephone rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The Gestapo was on the phone -- he should come down immediately, which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He had weekly contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He probably had to report to them on -- on the state of immigration and how people you know people -- we were still able to get a lot of people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And in fact my own cousin was able to leave through <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , went to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , and managed to get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> before the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So he was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The head of this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> came back and told us, "We're going to close up now. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We are going to be deported tomorrow to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And he went upstairs to notify the president of the Mannheim Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And so eventually around noon, we closed up the <span class="BUILDING">community offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I said to my mother, "We are going to pack now because we're going to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And my mother was totally -- couldn't believe this. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So I started to pull out suitcases, started to put stuff together which I wanted to take along and when she saw I was really dead serious about it, she finally -- half-heartedly believed that what I was saying was true, and then after dark, at night, a -- we had a man who worked for us, bringing up coal from the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , when we lived in our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And he came at night surreptitiously, to tell us that he had heard from his friends at the police, that we would be deported tomorrow to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And then she finally believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Unfortunately, why we couldn't -- we were not able to communicate with our friends because telephones were no longer an item for Jewish families after 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So we packed and indeed, the next morning the Gestapo rang around eight o'clock and told us that we were arrested and in the name of the people, we should pack what we should take and they would pick us up in a hour which was really two and a half or three hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So they -- the people were fairly decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They gave many people enough time to pack, half-way reasonably. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They explained we should take stuff along which was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We were allowed to take what we can carry, plus 100 marks, plus I believe food for two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They came. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They picked us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We were brought to I think it was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and then we were loaded into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger trains</span> no less and this was an action which related to all German Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> , in the State of Baden, and the <span class="REGION">Palatinate</span> ; the two Nazi officials who -- or the Nazi official who was responsible for these two states wanted to be one of he first ones to report that he has no more Jews 1n his state. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So we were loaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We, we went into this special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and 1t was one of seven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which, if I remember right which was to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and shortly before we departed, an SS officer appeared in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> '’ Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German)- why he came to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> I don't know, was haphazardly -- and picked out a man who wore in his lapel a sign which identified him as a, a German war veteran of World War I. He appointed him chief of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left, we went first through the <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span> the SS appeared, threatening us and changing -- exchanging our money and telling us that if any money would be found on anybody in excess; of the 100 marks, we were permitted to take the person -- people would be arrested and shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But nobody -- they never searched anybody, and there were indeed probably a number of people who gambled and had more money on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So our 100 marks were exchanged for 2000 French francs and then we went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> and apparently, we were the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> so when in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> , the French gendarmarie which was at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> looked for some spokesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">The man who was appointed the transport chief identified himself and asked me to translate because he didn't speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So it turned out these -- the French were not notified by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They were -- the French were told that there are Alsatians coming who don't want to stay under the German rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But that was all they were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They didn't know numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They didn't know that this was a lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They were dumbfounded when they found that there were German Jews in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and this was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and, of course, they didn't know there were six others coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So they gave us some food, and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Actually, we were deported on the 22nd and we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oloron</span> , which is the closest <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the 25th, so we were three days in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we came -- we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oloron</span> in a down pour which was unbelievable and we were put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which turned out to be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp de Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">For identification purposes, let's say that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp de Gurs</span> 1s in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> about 40 or 60 miles from the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Could you describe your arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> we -- when we unloaded in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it was still raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And so it was -- I believe it was evening, and so we were taken into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and distributed into a <span class="DLF">camp block</span> , 30 or 40 people into one <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">All we found was an empty <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">All the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">There was some straw and they gave us empty covers and we had to do -- we had to fill them to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And the ground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> is -- I don't know how to describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">There was very little there were -- there was one central <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> incidentally was built by -- by the Spanish for the Spanish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And so we were dumped into these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There was a -- at the beginning we had milit-- paramilitary gendarmeries there who guarded us and, of course, men and women were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It took awhile to sort out where everybody was, but eventually we found out where -- where our -- the members of our families were. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I was deported with my mother and Incidentally, my grandmother had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> abruptly on September 1, 1939, because she was a French citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">She tried to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where she had a sister, but <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> had imposed visa requirements and she couldn't go into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> so she ended up in an old age <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nancy</span> and eventually she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> she joined my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and eventually she set up <span class="BUILDING">household</span> with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> , and she died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  How old was she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  My grandmother was born on January 27, 1970, so she was about --
QUESTION:  1870?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  1870. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So she was she was about 73 or 74. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I think 73.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Let's come back to you -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Well, the beginning, of course, was very chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We didn't -- and the first night, we didn't even have our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> was brought the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It was just dumped in the rain and we had to pull our -- you know, it was lying in a big pile and he had to find our luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And which I did for both myself and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And so my mother was in one <span class="DLF">block</span> and I was in the other, and there was nothing to do, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We could not get out of the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I was here and my mother was a few hundred yards further north in another <span class="DLF">block</span> with the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And by the time all of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> had finally arrived there were over 7,000 or 8,000 people in the, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for which the authorities had, of course, very little advance warning because nobody knew we were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Well, eventually things settled down. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Every time it rained people would fall in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> , particularly the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The food was abominable. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We had very little to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The French had nothing to eat, so we had even less. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And since a friend of my father was the vice chief of the <span class="DLF">block</span> where I was in, I managed eventually to get myself occupied by working in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the -- each <span class="DLF">block</span> had its own <span class="BUILDING">administrative office</span> and I managed to work in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The one advantage of this was that it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">There was no heating material, but the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> had, of course, more heat so during the day I was reasonably warm while I was working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And periodically, maybe once or twice a week, you managed to get enough -- a pass to visit members of your family in the other <span class="DLF">block</span> and my mother worked in the <span class="BUILDING">block office</span> where she was because the woman who was picked as the chief of the <span class="DLF">block</span> had only one qualification. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">She spoke fluent French. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">She was probably the only one who spoke as fluent as French as she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">My mother spoke French obviously, so she managed to be this woman who spoke so fluent French managed to become the block head of the <span class="DLF">block</span> which had benefits. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">You had a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">At night the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">She had alone -- she lived alone in this big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> which during the day was the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and somehow or other, all of the block chiefs ate better or most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They just took food out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and life settled down. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">There wasn't very much to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Eventually I managed -- we managed to get musical instruments and we started to play a quartet and in this respect, I must say, the French administration, who really showed not very much sympathy organized to have one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in each <span class="DLF">block</span> as a cultural, as a <span class="BUILDING">cultural barrack</span> so you had lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We gave concerts, and for me it was very good because the moment I was a part of a quartet, I had a permanent pass and I could circulate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And the instruments came from the YMCA"* who, who were with other organizations very active in trying to ameliorate our fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  What instrument did you play?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  I played cello. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I met my wife in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  Tell me about that meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Oh, my wife worked in, in the -- she was a messenger, I believe, in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where my mother worked, so when -- I met her when I visited my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And eventually the Secours Suisse’, or rather the Swiss Red Cross who had sent a nurse -- Elsbeth Kasser, she is still alive -- set up in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , breakfast for the young generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And that was really -- I don't remember now if we got it once or if we got it daily or if we got it two or three times a week, but we got a supplementary feeding which helped many of us survive better. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So, every morning I would come -- I would -- we were permitted, of course, to leave the -- the <span class="DLF">block</span> for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We would I would pick up my wife at the end of the -- her <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We would walk together to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to have our food and come back, and I would see my wife every time when I obviously we weren't married then -- when I would visit my mother or if I came to visit to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We met in a -- I met her in, I think, it was December of 1940, so this is now 50 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  What kinds of things were you able to do during the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Were you able to see your wife during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We saw each other fairly frequently since I could circulate. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">She worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I think she, she will tell you that herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">She was giving out mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">She was running errands. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she was able to leave well before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">She left in, I think, in September of “41. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I am not sure about the date. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">She will tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  We'll take that up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  You take that up with her. '</span><span class="sentence" id="309">® Young Men’s Christian Association ’? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Swiss Aid (French)
QUESTION:  Let's pick up where you -- I am sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  I was still in my <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">However, eventually the French authorities needed to stage an example on -- for everybody's benefit to limit corruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">By corruption I mean the two chiefs in my <span class="DLF">block</span> and one chief's wife were really stealing food from the <span class="DLF">block</span> and lived very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And there were French inspectors who noticed this and eventually this became -- was very pervasive. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I believe it was done in almost every <span class="DLF">block</span> with the exception of one. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And the French became concerned with this, so since other things happened about which I am not quite sure what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They caught them in all kinds of unethical things. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They decided to stage an example and to get rid of these people, the <span class="DLF">block</span> was dissolved. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And one morning before some movement of people started, the redistribution of our entire <span class="DLF">block</span> to other <span class="DLF">blocks</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The French inspector who was responsible for our <span class="DLF">block</span> , stood in front of me and asked me if I would do a job for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The job was I had to inventory -- do the inventory for the whatever little equipment there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It was my first experience with inventory. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Little did I know that in my later life, inventory would play a big role because in accounting, inventory is a very important feature. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And so when this was done and I had given him all the lists and all the equipment, He said to me, "I will thank you in kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I will take care of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Now I don't have something for you at the moment." </span><span class="sentence" id="328">He knew I was working at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten that job. "</span><span class="sentence" id="330">But I will take care of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So I was put into really a terrible <span class="DLF">block</span> mostly with people who were not from the group of German Jews who were other people who were interned there. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I was there about three weeks, very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Fortunately, I had my pass and I could get out when I wanted to get out to see my mother and.... Well, one day three weeks later, he stood again in front of me, "I haven't forgotten you. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I have a job for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We'll move you to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and you can do the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="336">This was a very privileged position because I shared the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , but it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a <span class="DLF">door</span> with our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Had only a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span> , but it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> while we slept basically on little wooden platforms which the Spanish refugees had made for us for money with barbed wire where the barbs were taken out and the wire was used as, as a mattress support. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So there I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We could light a fire in the evening during the day and I shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a man who was really responsible for -- he was really the, the block chief for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to the extent that this was necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">This was basically the job of accompanying really sick people who had to be evacuated to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> daily back and forth to either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oloron</span> , which was the closest point to a doctor or to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And eventually I also was able to commute once in awhile out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , breathe some fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">In retrospect, of course, it was stupid I never took my mother along. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I -- if I would have taken my mother along and gone with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pau</span> , we could have managed probably to escape and join my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But being Germans, it never occurred to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Eventually in -- I was approached or my mother was approached -- if I could leave -- if there would apply -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> some -- somewhere a <span class="NPIP">place</span> could be found for me if I would be permitted to leave my mother and get -- to get out of camp and, of course, she consented to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And so in probably in July of 1942 after 20 months I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the same social worker who escorted Hanne and her group to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , and was bought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Talluyers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Talluyers</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">With me was one other young fellow about a year or a year and a half younger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And the two of us were brought to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> which was run by the Jewish Boy Scouts of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was a <span class="DLF">working farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There were a lot of young people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The one problem we had with the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was neither he nor I were Orthodox and this was not an <span class="DLF">Orthodox farm</span> , but an ultra-Orthodox farm. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">They didn't let us work too much because they knew we were so skinny, we couldn't have worked anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And around the end of July, the very end of July, my girlfriend came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> having obtained permission to visit her mother and I saw her then for the first time after about a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And when she came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , she came again to tell me that her mother was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">She could not enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">She will tell you that herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we arranged then and there that if there would be problems for me that I should try to make my way to where she was because she felt certain that there would be help for anybody who is up there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Now, you must remember this was -- she was, of course, in 1942, she was just 17 and since people didn't talk about what was going on, it was just the feeling she had and she knew there would be help. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">What we didn't know was that about a week or two after she had left we -- an announcement was made by the management of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> that they were notified that in about two weeks or two and a half weeks, there would be raids on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and all the foreign Jews would be arrested, which meant all of us, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But not to worry, that we would be helped by hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But when the time came to disperse everybody, help was indeed forthcoming for everybody but four of us -- my friend from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> and two other somewhat older young fellows who were not Orthodox -- we were told to help ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">What was interesting 1s that these people who were running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> it was an Alsatian Jew and two Rabbis who - because they are still alive I won't mention their names -- German Rabbis, who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> who are mentioned by name in, in -- as being very helpful while they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> -- in a book by Schramm” about her experiences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> and but there was no help for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We were told, "Do what you feel is right. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Go wherever you want to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And that was the end for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So my friend and I from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , which wasn't so far away from there, because all we knew Hanne had explained to us, we leave to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Etienne</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Etienne</span> I believe there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  On the camp management, well the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- I want to make sure this 1s clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp *</span> ’ Hanne Schramm management did take care of everybody except you four.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  The farm management.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Took care -- took care of all of the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">In fact, I understand that most of these people today are in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , including the principals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  What, what was the life like for you on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> for those two or three weeks you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  It was probably 5, four or five weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I have a very hazy recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I really don't remember much. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">It was obviously much better than it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but you know, I am not the one who is at ease 1n any <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I am not the type.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Let's hold it for a moment and let us change tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">TAPE #2
ANSWER:  ...And you know, I have talked with other people about this and they really said that they're not surprised because the Germans are very rigid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  What a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Hold on. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Is the tape rolling again? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We're back on for an hour? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We're back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Just one minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I think we should finish this and we should finish this and I think we should finish it on the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Will you tell us on tape about the incident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> please that you were describing to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">but to -- to finish up with the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We were -- Hanne and I and our daughter was in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> only a very short time, a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We were walking down <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> , pushing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> when we ran into the two rabbis who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Talluyers</span> and whom al-- of course, we also knew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  These are the two rabbis who had refused to help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  These are the two rabbis who did, did nothing to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And their reaction was actually very interesting because if they could have sunk into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> to disappear when they saw us and we started to talk with them for a minute or two, they would have really disappeared because they visibly had a bad conscience when they saw us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So you left the <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  So, we left the <span class="DLF">farm</span> early in the morning and by 10 o'clock at night, we were in the <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  Did you have help in getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">We took, we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  We had a few francs, and we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Well, it was 10 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Where I am going to find Hanne at 10 o'clock at night? </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I don't even know where she is. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So, we decided we're going to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">There was a little <span class="DLF">wooded opening</span> in the middle of nowhere, and we decided that we are going to put our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bags</span> down and we're going to sleep there. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Around four-thirty, five o’clock, five-fifteen in the morning, we hear -- we had just woken up and we had just folded up our sleeping bags when we hear girls' voices passing on the <span class="DLF">path</span> where we were in the in the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and who walked by? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Hanne! </span><span class="sentence" id="420">With a few of the teenage girls who were with her in the little <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  You didn't see Hanne?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  No, Hanne was -- in fact, Hanne during this period was hiding herself most of the time with another farmer because there were raids going on all over the so-called unoccupied zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the people were being arrested and deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So one day the farmer brought me a little note from Hanne so at least I knew, aside from hearing from Hanne, I knew that people knew where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And lo and behold a few days later at right somebody came to pick me up to bring me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I slept in the same <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> where I was -- when I was *' Mireille Philip brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The next day Madame Philip, and I saw Hanne, of course, who had come back at the same time too apparently, and Madame Philip explained to me that they are going to make photograph of me, giving me false papers and will help me to get across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to the <span class="REGION">French Alps</span> and from there I would be helped into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So they had -- the papers were made. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I got them at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And the next morning I set off with three other young fellows from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">In a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , we went across that portion of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">French Alps</span> and we stopped -- I don't remember the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">One - I believe it was one stop before Saint Gervais -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">French Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">There a 10 year old boy picked us up, brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We met there a, a young Protestant minister who was supposed to go with us when we would cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to learn the route so that he would help people later on go the same route. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So the next morning we set off. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Our guide was this 10 year old boy who knew these, these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> like his back pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">The priest and the four of us, the minister and the four of us and we climbed all day until it was night. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We stayed -- it was raining at night -- we stayed under an overhang under a rock so we were dry and we -- I was even able to sleep even. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And we continued the next day and sometimes maybe at eight o’clock, we started very early, and sometimes during the morning the boy said, "Now, from here on, you are on your own.” </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He explained to us where we had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">He told us we would have to go down this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We were about -- I don't now -- .somewhere around the 9,000 foot level probably, maybe a little less, maybe a little more, well above the <span class="DLF">tree line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">He explained to us where we should go and said we would come into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They also told us -- the minister told us, we should get rid of our false identification cards because they were afraid that if the Swiss find false papers on us, they might suspect an organized effort behind this and would immediately return us. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Well we, we climbed most of the day down, eventually ended up on a <span class="DLF">highway</span> which was totally deserted, and walked on this <span class="DLF">highway</span> further down, descended through a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> we were stopped by a patrol who had -- as they told us when they brought us back to the -- to a <span class="BUILDING">mountain hut</span> where we found another 30 or 40 people which were gone during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They told us that they had watched for hours with their glasses coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The next morning we were, we were able to buy -- I had one or two Francs. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It was enough to buy some breakfast in this <span class="BUILDING">mountain hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">All of us were told that we would be returned to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">We would not be kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">A detachment of soldiers started to bring us back up into what 1s -- what they called no man's land, from where we would descend again to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Now we came into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , in the valley not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Finhaut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I was able to determine this later where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And I managed also in the morning during breakfast to look at the map and I had somebody show me from the Swiss where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So I knew exactly where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So a detachment of soldier--soldiers took us back up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , well above the <span class="DLF">tree line</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And then something very extraordinary happened during this hike up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">All of a sudden, a non-commissioned Swiss soldier started to scream at me and tiraded me for about 15 minutes, screamed at me what I'm not permitted to do: I'm not permitted to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I'm not permitted to do this, I am not permitted to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">What the man really did in these 15 minutes, he laid out for me but exactly how to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">All I had to do 1s subtract the word "not." </span><span class="sentence" id="460">The tragedy was that everybody in our group heard this. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Nobody understood what this man was trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So eventually the captain of -- of this detachment stopped and told us that they would stay here and we should go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So the first thing I did was -- we went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We went across a <span class="DLF">bend</span> , around the bend, where I was sure the Swiss couldn't see us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Then I stopped the whole group and I explained to them what just had transpired, and they had all heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And we argued this out for an hour and nobody understood -- had understood what this was all about and these people were so shaken that after an hour of talking with them, I finally found one person who was willing to see the -- my logic and my reasoning that we know what's down there and all we do is possibly waste another day, but we also may -- might save our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So this one fellow and I separated from the group, and the rest went down and I went back towards <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We crossed a little icy stream coming down, which was a <span class="DLF">glacier border</span> , you know, but not further than a few like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Was very narrow because it had only started a little further up, and we climbed further up and all of a sudden we were on a very, very narrow <span class="DLF">path</span> and the fellow who was with me who didn't know really where he was -- an Austrian, I never saw him again after, after we separated in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- wanted to go to the nght and I wanted to go down to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I said, “When -- look when you go to the right, you're going nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You're going back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> possibly.” </span><span class="sentence" id="472">But in order to convince him, I said, "Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Let's walk to the right the way you want to walk because I am sure you will, will end up nowhere." </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And lo and behold, after five minutes, we were abruptly at the precipice down 1,000 or 3,000 feet, was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So, he finally believed me and we turned around and we walked the same <span class="DLF">path</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We came back and eventually this very narrow little <span class="DLF">path</span> became wider and became wider, became a little <span class="DLF">road</span> and we eventually came into a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Finhaut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now I had no Swiss money. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He still had some. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And we had been told in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> already that if we need help we should look for a Protestant minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">If there's no Protestant minister, go to the Catholic priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They probably will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There was a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Yeah, but the priest wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">He was -- had gone into the valley for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So we went on and it became dusk. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I didn't want to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Finhaut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It was too big for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So it became eventually dark and we walked and we came through another few -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of maybe 10 or 15 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and I looked around and I said, "I don't want to sleep in the open again tonight." </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I had slept two nights before in the open -- 1n the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So I picked a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which I thought looked friendly and just knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and a man peers out. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I explained to him, "We are refuges. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Could we stay over for the night?" </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And he said, Well, he's newly-wed. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It's not his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">It's a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of his brother-in-law, but why don't we wait. “</span><span class="sentence" id="497">T'll, I'll ask him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Well, after five minutes, he came back, "Come on in." </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They gave us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They gave us breakfast the next morning and they explained to us where we were and where we should go, so we walked most of the day and, and he also told us not to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martigny</span> -- which was the next larger <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martigny</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">garrison city</span> with military police all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So -- and military all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We would probably get, get stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So we went to -- he showed us a way how to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I don't remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And by then it was already two or three o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Here we had walked all day to come down and then I went again to the Catholic priest's house. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He gave us two eggs to eat, which was something because there was strict rationing in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he gave me five francs which was enough to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> , the next bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , where I wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And he also told me, "Don't go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">express trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">express train</span> is checked by military police. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">local train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And lo and behold, we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Nobody had bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Then I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and I really, for a moment, didn't know what to do with myself until about 15 or 20 -- we were wondering aimlessly around this -- this <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> until I realized, “You are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">God, why don't you look in the telephone for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I went to the telephone book. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">The other guy wasn't much help. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And lo and behold, the Jewish Community was Rue de la Gare — it’s the <span class="DLF">railroad street</span> , the <span class="DLF">station street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So we went out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and within one or two minutes, we were -- we walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , who welcomed us and told us, "Now look, we have to turn you over to the Swiss authorities, but don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">You will not be returned." </span><span class="sentence" id="522">These people had not known, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I had never told anybody that I had been arrested and, and the Swiss who were up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> did not take apparently our names down, did not report it, so nobody knew apparently, as it turned out, that I had been 48 hours or 24 hours before already in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and was returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So we were turned over to the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We were kept for a few days in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ouchy</span> , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> , where we had to fill out long questionnaires and were interrogated by some investigators who fortunately did not speak German and my Austrian friend with whom I had come did not speak French or very little French, so I was translating the way it suited me from what he said, to what I told the guy, so he never knew anything what I didn't want him to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ouchy</span> , we were taken to a quarantine, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">You can't call 1t a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="528">It was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">local inn</span> , where they had made matt-- you know, platforms to sleep on. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And they fed us, and the food was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">There was nothing wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It wasn't, wasn't French food. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It was at least -- and we were there from September after -- oh yeah, end of September, October first maybe until about four weeks and then four weeks later, we were transferred to another identical facility on the other end of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> in the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and there I was for another four weeks probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And on December 22nd, 1942 I was given papers to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> again in the French part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And when I came there in the early afternoon, the only person in the camp was the camp director. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It was then a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian camp</span> -- was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> with <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">The only person there was a director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp who</span> had -- with his wife and his small child at the time, who not that small -- the daughter was maybe 12 or 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Everybody else was on leave somewhere 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So the first question was, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I said, "I was assigned here" "You have any family somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I said, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I have a cousin here." "</span><span class="sentence" id="542">Let's call him. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Maybe you can go there." </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So I came from, from almost the <span class="DLF">border</span> of, of the Swiss-German border and I went practically back to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> because my cousin lived very close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And I spent three days or four days with my cousin during the Christmas holidays and then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I started camp life in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Do you know -- two questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Did you know first what happened to the people who you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I don't know what happened to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I don't know really what happened to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  What <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was it that you are in what internment? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Do you know the name of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="558">In, in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I was in many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> and we can -- I can read them off to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I have this--
QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">The one where you just left--
ANSWER:  Was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sierre</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">QUESTION:  How long were you there and what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="562">What was life like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was set up really to clear <span class="REGION">land</span> , to make <span class="REGION">land</span> arable because there was a great shortage of food in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You know, they had to be more or less self supporting and I am really not familiar with the dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We can -- I can show you the dates afterwards on my -- when we take a photo of the identifications -- Swiss identification papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Well, when I came back, it had snowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There were about two or three feet of snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And the first thing we had to do was to clear the <span class="DLF">road</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="DLF">street</span> -- to the main <span class="DLF">highway</span> and I didn't very much appreciate this. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I don't like physical labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So I decided at that point already that this is not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I got to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And I managed to get, within two weeks, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They needed somebody in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> because there was a great deal of administrative work to be done on a daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There was rationing and you had to do rationing reports which had to be typed a certain way in order to get the rationing tickets to which we all were entitled to or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was entitled to, so there was a great deal of administrative work to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So I went into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I was in <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refuge camps</span> or <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for the rest of my Swiss stay for five and one half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I was in -- the only time I was out was a few months while I was -- where I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> where I took some social services courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">We -- one did not know what would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I had no profession basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So when the opportunity came to take some courses in social service, I took the opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I was put in the pension in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and I took these courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Incidentally, we also got married during this period in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Tell, tell me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">How did you meet up again with Hanne and how did you--?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Well, Hanne came in February of -- February 28, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">She will tell you she came a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">The difference between her and me was that I came and remained an illegal alien in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for the entire five and a half years we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> while the moment Hanne set foot on <span class="REGION">Swiss soil</span> , she was legal because her relatives had procured a Swiss visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">We managed to get permission after I was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">After all, I knew the ropes, how to do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> all this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I got permission to bring her .with me, to live with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Then eventually they decided since she is really not an internee, and a -- but a legal foreigner, she could not live with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Then we had to go through the charade of having a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , renting a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreux</span> would cost a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">We had to pay for the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which she didn't use once. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">She stayed with me in, in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Eventually, we were able to give up the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And after the social services course we came -- I went back to a <span class="BUILDING">refuge home</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I was assigned again to an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , to run an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">By the way, while I was, while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and Hanne was 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> -- and the circumstances of Hanne staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> she will tell you herself -- we, all of a sudden, we are approached by -- now I can't think of the name of the man -- by a German Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I believe he was Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And we were not married at the time yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Hanne will probably supply the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I can't think of it right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">He invited us for tea twice, and he was really trying to recruit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">The war would end soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">It was in 1944 or early 1945, and why wouldn't we come to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> where the Russians were to help build up <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And we got into a rather lengthy discussion twice about the merits of going into an authoritarian dictatorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I pointed out to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and the camps in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> which the man tried not to play down, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And eventually, I made -- we made it clear to him that we are not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">What is interesting about these two interviews is that about 20 years later, we are reading an obituary in the New York Times about the right hand of Mr. Brandt’’, who was German Prime Minister, and it was this man and the obituary related that after the war, he came back to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> , eventually ran afoul of the Russian authorities, was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , somehow when he was released managed to get to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and became the right hand man of Mr. Brandt. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So, 2 Willy Brandt (nee Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm) Hanne and I got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in -- on April 14, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Our daughter was born in March of 1946, and in 1948 in -- after we had obtained our visas for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we came here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  Where did you go once you came here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">In the beginning, you know, I was told, "Go to HIAS”. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Maybe they can help you." </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And we went, and the suggestion was made, "Why don't you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pritoria</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peoria</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="619"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peoria</span> , <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Well, first, of course, no where -- I didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">For the first two weeks so I permitted myself the question, '"Who’s going to pay for all of this?" “</span><span class="sentence" id="622">Well, your relatives, of course.” </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So, we never went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peoria</span> , <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Probably after we all finish with the interview tomorrow or the day after, I probably can think of all kinds of things which I forgot, but nght now --
QUESTION:  Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">What I would like to do now is to photograph the passports that he brought with us -- with him, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">What we will do, we will ask you to hold each up, and describe it, but they have to do funny things with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Yeah, I realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We will, we will Hanne her passports and I will just show mine, my two. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And then we'll show the travel document yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  My notes say here that you succeeded in returning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">When are you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You talked -- when we talked, before the interview, you said -- you described the 30 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">You're just talking about a later visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">That is much, much -- No. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">That is five years ago, four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">That's all I needed to make sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  It's not of consequence to--
QUESTION:  I just needed to be very clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  This is my internal refugee pass for <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It contained identification with a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It shows-- *° United Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  You'll have to hold on that longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  Longer? </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Raise your hand when, when you want me --
QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">ANSWER:  It shows that there were always periods given in which we are permitted to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">It was always a year or so and then it had to be renewed, which was a formality because they know, they know we couldn't go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It shows here, for instance, that we were interned by order of the police -- the federal police really. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">This is the record of all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where I was in from. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And it finally has pages which shows what rationing cards were issued to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Because after all, the Swiss are worse bureaucrats than the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Now finally, on this page are three numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">One is a number which -- under which I went while I was interned in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Actually I was more in formal <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> which due to the war were empty and where refugees were housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">One of those numbers is a police department number from the federal police. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">My -- I had an aunt who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , who was married in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , who gave on the occasion of one of her visits a passport application where we had tried for me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> to study at the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory of music</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And as we discovered, this was a number which was given to me by the Swiss when I became -- when I came into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Not only this, but when Hanne married me, all of sudden she -- this same number turned up on her refugee pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We never were told anything about it, but you know the Swiss are very subtle. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And since we had to fill out when we came a questionnaire of maybe 30 pages, they were able to trace back who we were and they matched my passport application from 1939 to my arrival in 1942 in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Now, the other thing I wanted to show yet is the passport I used or we were issued in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> since we refused to accept German papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I did not want a German passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I wanted no part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So this is the Swiss travel document which was used for us to obtain our American visa which is in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">It's just like a regular passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">It had our transit visa and our immigration visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">This is the immigration visa into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> signed by the same man who had been promoted from Vice Consul to Consul who in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> gave untold people untold trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I don't know if this ever was mentioned in an interview, but to obtain a immigration visa in those days in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was an extremely harrowing experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Any pretext would be used to deny a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">People would come with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">The child might have bumped her arm or his leg and there would be a blue mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">This was enough, during the physical examination which was given in the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , to reyect an application or to postpone an application for three, or four, or five months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  Alright. [</span><span class="sentence" id="683">Conclusion of interview] </span>
