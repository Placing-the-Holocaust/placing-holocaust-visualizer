<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: . </span><span class="sentence" id="1">.in in...when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">This was still the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> under Communist regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">It was very difficult to have conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">You were, of course, followed everywhere and you were under supervision everywhere and you had to be very careful what you talked about, and more was a delightful (laugher) subject which nobody could uh uh object to. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And so I told one evening this story and and uh the dinner where I was invited and the major Jewish uh personalities of the various groups, they they...all through those communities, the liberal community, Zionist...they were all there and uh the result was that a few months uh weeks later, I got from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the World Jewish Congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> a letter, saying you told us this interesting... BREAK IN TAPE ...and report what they lived through. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And we have here about four thousand such uh witnesses and there are some which write and speak about uh the and the . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Are you interested in these .. reports? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Now I personally, of course, I was interested but uh the uh those who really needed it was uh the the international authority pursuing the the , so«I looked for an opportunity to get in touch with the people who were involved in the in the uh prosecution of the people and I wrote a letter and there was no uh personal communication since <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was still completely cut out from the circulation, normal circulation, and uh and I learned that Kastner was asked to uh to go as a witness to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> and they asked him to take a letter to uh to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> and give it to the uh uh competent prosecutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And he did this, and when he came back he told me the story which was very uh stranger He didn't...this was typical of Kastner. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He didn't just give the letter (laughter) to to the prosecutor who was Mr. , the assistant...the former assistant of of uh . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He, by the way, has written a full book about the uh the prosecution about against and the and so on, and when he came to...when Kastner came to , whom he didn't of course know, he was there in order to give witness in the case against Baker (ph) and the people with whom he had cooperated, and when he gave the the letter, the prosecutor looked at the signaturea found my signature, and said something like, hum, very reliable. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Very reliable. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Now he was, of course, fascinated and flabbergasted... how does this man know my name with all, and (coughing) and asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Then he told him, you know, this 18 a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I can't tell you this now but if you have time in the evening, we can go have dinner together and I'll tell you the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And so it .. happened, and it happened that he told him the whole story which you'll find them in Morganthal's diaries which were published in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Collier's</span> a few months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I heard this story the first time from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kastner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Was a little bit uh doubtful, but when I came uh uh a month or two months later to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , this issue of Collier's appeared, while I was there, and for the first time the whole story came out and uh I must say I was very impressed by by the . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They are very fine uh uh civil servants and we owe them much that this sabotage will see uh State Department, they came out and and was acknowledged. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">There was a clear <span class="DLF">line</span> in the State Department which really didn't want to be cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I think the head of it was Breckenridge Long (ph), uh one of the higher officials in the State Department who was put there by Roosevelt because he or his family had given considerable funds to to the election...electoral funds of Roosevelt, but really the the policy which they pursued I don't think really were in the <span class="DLF">line</span> of of Rooseveltts liberal attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh Breckenridge Long really considered his holy duty to keep the Jews out of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I think this can without reservation be affirmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION: Uh there are those historians who say that uh Peter Berksen and his organization... BREAK IN TAPE
ANSWER: This I have heard many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I personally believe that this 18 highly exaggerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh I believe one can argue very uh uh with with great justification that my telegram of April 1943 with all the proposals it contained, uh has led directly to the establishment of the of the uh uh refugee board. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I think when when these proposals were submitted to Morganthal and , and were approved by both, and nothing happened, and found out in July which means several months later that nothing happened and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morganthal</span> and complained, and that led to the decisive action of Morganthal. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">One...in the asking of the report asking the two assistants the boys they paid to find out what really happened, and number two, he he he...really on the basis of this reportt he was able to go to the President and to complain. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Thirdly, he was able at the same time, not only to present this famous report on the acquiescence of this government in the mass murder of the Jews, he was able to use this opportunity to come with a positive suggestion, and this positive suggestion he had uh prepared it with his uh legal advisor, Professor , and this was the idea of the War Refugee Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Now uh I believe he has a direct <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">As a matter of fact, uh even the way in which the matters proceeded, uh when I got just before Christmas the first license, and I talked about this already, and then the revised form ten days later and then another revised form uh making business easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh had made all kinds of criticism of the strictness of the uh . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Again, about two weeks or three weeks later, and the second revised form is really the day when the War Refugee Board was established and the facility of these licenses extended to everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Now here 1s a very clear <span class="DLF">line</span> to show that this was really the outcome of these plans which I had submitted and which Morganthal picked up and and used as the major uh material in order to ask the President finally to act. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He was uh a great politician. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He himself used some of the uh propaganda of Birksen (ph) to put it...to the disposal of his _1 own policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But he used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It was not that they had really the decisive influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There are uh for a long time plans from this extremist groups uh that they had decisive influence on things as they developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I contest this very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I think that uh they may have had an influence on public opinion at certain moments to uh raise the consciousness of the the public, which I will not contest, but on the real action I don't think they had any decisive influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION: Uh what were the most important actions of the War Refugee Board as you see it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER: Well, let me say...I1 mean the War Refugee Board has also been criticized a number of times and said that certainly, rightlyt it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was much too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was...1t came into force in the beginning of uh 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">If it would have been established a year earlier or two years earlier, it would have been probably much more efficient, but nevertheless, it was mainly the only decisive action which was taken, and the whole situation changed uh all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We had really the support of the <span class="BUILDING">American embassies</span> and legatlons all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">In in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> .. and in and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ankara</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And this never happened before. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Here is really, and this you have to acknowledge even if you're perhaps critical on some of the actions he could have done more, but it was a decisive effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Number two...during the period during which it was active, that means generally '44 to ,' | 1 May '45...this early the end of the war, uh twenty million dollars have been uced, Jewish money...I come to this later...twenty million dollars have been used in order to alleviate the fate of the persecuted, the Nazi persecuted victims, Jews and lots of nonJews, uh but the great majority, of course, Jews, and the the money was Jewish money. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Now with this money, lots of things have been done but it was not only the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It was also the determination to explore all possibilities by which Jews uh people...victims could be helped and and the uh action of the Nazis counter-acted. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Uh my opinion, there were a number of things which were finally uh were obtained. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Uh on the one hand, for instance, there were a few uh...which has nothing to do directly with the War Refugee Board but it has to be mentioned as something which has has happened...uh the exchange uh uh agreements. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There was a number of of uh prisoners of war who especially wounded and and heavily wounded who were exchanged as through the Red Cross, and there was a great number of Palestinian Jews amongst them. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I Aaw the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> passing through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Uh these were important actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The second is a certain...I'm not exaggerating...a aertain alleviation of the situation in the neutral aountries. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Uh not direct guarantees were given, but they were encouraged and they were told .. well, we will help you after the war to distribute the people that not...shouldn't be only on on on your charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">This could have been much more energetically pursued, in my opinion (coughing) and it should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I believe that <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> could have taken in the double or the triple of of people which they they took in, and w they're they're not so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who can say they took as many as <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> did, but but...and this was the general situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But this was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Then the what I said referred indirectly of any..the end of the uh financial blockade and of the food blockade in favor of the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">This is really a great decision, and I quoted how I was received in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> when the first license came and they were very astonished because the British had blockade and so the ministry of uh..-I don't remember...economic warfare I think it was the name in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ...uh tried to stop the license until the last moment, and in fact it was given to me several weeks after it was also was to be delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Now this was really important. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh really there was no no uh lack of money any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">If you really wanted to do something, the money was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh I wouldn't say that Sonny Meyer (ph) and others who disposed _ , they had some problems there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we certainly had problems, uh couldn't raise the money in Europe at the time, (coughing) and the the food blockade. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I mean I never...I think I said it already...I never observed a food blockade. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I uh 1 disobeyed my colleagues and my superiors in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in this matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They were not very happy, but ". </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I considered that I was in a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I could use uh and .\ should use whatever I could in helping starving Jews in the <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span> and this would...but a great action. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I think , it was engaged and food passes by the Joint through the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">T think they gave them a million dollars or something like it, and this was done now under in a in a very...in a much larger uh uh proportion as it was possible before. : . ! </span><span class="sentence" id="77">8 I myself...the the Congress...the <span class="BUILDING">World Congress office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> has uh during the war sent hundreds of thousands of of parcels, uh mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , small parcels but uh which certainly have have helped thousands and thousands of people to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION: Let me stop you there for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They have to fix something in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They're shutting off the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Just a few seconds....
QUESTION: Dr.Riegner, you were telling us about the actions that the War Refugee Board took or made possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER: Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Uh I spoke about the uh the big . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Now uh the next point I would like to underline is the support which was given to the actlvities of the underground uh in order to help Jews on the spot uh to survive through uh thanks to false papers which were used in great masses, uh papers of every kind uh especially uh ration cards which had to be renewed every month uh could use in the tens of thousands and the hundred thousands probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Identity papers, false identity papers, uh baptismal certificates which were of course not , but uh showed that the people were not Jews, uh uh working permits, uh every kind of identity and uh identity cards and so on which could be used in very very larte masses...uh numbers and uh we had in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> but particularly groups who were charged with this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And it was not only this helped uh tens of thousands of people to maintain themselves, to hide and to somehow disappear under the general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">On the other hand, there was a special service established in <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> by the Jewish uh resistance movement which tried particularly to organize the immigration of Jewish youngsters uh towards spain and <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> and then the free world, or towards <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And uh these groups uh were extremely successful They brought several thousand children to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , a number of them with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">There were several hundred parents also came. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Uh there were a considerable number of youngsters accompanied by armed uh uh conduct to the <span class="DLF">Spanish frontier</span> and uh then they came out to the $ree world. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Uh this is...was one of the most successful activities and covered, as I said, thousands of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh of course, you would have liked to do much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It was directed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> particular by my colleague Mark Yahblume (ph) who was one of the French leaders who wrote from nineteen hundred and fortythree and nineteen hundred to the end of the war...was nearly end of the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and we did this together. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Uh he got money from the World Jewish Congress, from the Jewish agency, from the Joint, from the trade union movement, and uh altogether this was by the way one of the finest compilation and and rescue of of all kinds thanks to a person uh which was accepted in and which was...who was active in thi6 and kept the uh contact with the groups in in the <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh this is one of the finest things I think uh which took place and I'm very proud to have been personally involved in this and have helped in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Another very important action and this was the political . . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">10 action to save uh whatever could be saved of the Hungarian Jews in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Uh here again something happened which 1s very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We knew uh and I was responsible to warn before the <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was even occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">You can see in the files telegrams which I sent and and...several weeks before the actual started of the occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and immediately when it was undertaken, there's another great telegram where I asked uh what should be done in order to counteract it and it should be made public counteractions so the medias or the radio and so on, through t-he free radio from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and the and the...it should be very...an action encouraging not to cooperate with the Nazis, encouraging the non-Jews to help the Jews, to hide them and 80 on. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">There's a whole program which uh they have suggested to the free world and which was uh I believe to a certain degree used in uh by the the media and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But uh | uh the strange thing which happened in the case of the Hungarian Jews was that uh from March to June uh 1944, there came practically no direct news out from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , except what we read 1n the newspapers t in the legal gazettes and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So what legally happened we knew, but that in these three months, half the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> were sent to to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was practically unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh here the Red Cross played a very uh un... ..
ANSWER: Unhelpful? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">|
QUESTION: Unhelpful role. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They kept some of the reports from as | we know now from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and the Jewish organizations and didn't ! </span><span class="sentence" id="108">11 deliver them to the people who who were uh meant to receive them. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They are direct requests from the Jewish community to give these reports and we received them a month later when uh nothing could be done anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION: We need to talk more about the Red Cross and we need to talk more about <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , but I want to stop you right here and ask you something more about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because its its come up in aontext. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Uh there is, of course, uh an argument from some of the scholarly literature that while the outside world knew generally what was going on in terms of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> and so forth, that it did not know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birken</span> ...not know specifically about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and and <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , uh even up until the middle of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Do you want to to comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER: Well, that's probably true, that we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Uh we knew that things were happening in all kinds of <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but the uh concrete knowledge about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas ovens</span> , where they were exactlyw uh came much later, and the the report of the two Slovakian Jews was certainly a revelation for for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Uh they...there was .. also another report from a Polish officer which came at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And we are certainly also seen, uh but the the...also the...how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was organized, how the...where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas ovens</span> were placed, how the...around the the the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> , how this was...this was really the first time that we heard the I [ [ I; 12 ¢ real <span class="NPIP">inside</span> from this report which came terribly late, in June | 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Uh and even this 1s very strange why it took so long to to I get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Therews a story that it was given to the in | and it never arrived or or took several months to arrive in [ in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Now we got this this report uh in two ways in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The first uh copy arrived through the Slovak underground at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the Czechoslovakian representative to the League of Nations with whom I very closely cooperated during the whole war, Dr. . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh he had...I think I have mentioned it...he wrote very closely with one of his uh...with one...with one of our colleagues who was Czechoslovak, so . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Dr. and when the the report arrived, he called and asked him to bring it to me and to...he asked me to make a condensation of the report, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In four or five pages~..this report was...I don't know...forty pages or thirty pages, uh and this this condensed report I gave them not only to him who transmitted it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , but also to the British and to the Americans and the conden6ation has been used many...it comes out in many...1n many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I saw, for instance, the American ambassador in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He sent it to all kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It's exactly the same text in which I made. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The second copy came uh...I .. 1] would say a few...a few days or a week or ten days later, and arrived and came from the uh <span class="BUILDING">Budapest Palestine office</span> , uh Mr. , and was addressed to the <span class="BUILDING">president's office</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It came out through a man who died these days, . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh he had some facilities as a secretary of a <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , and 13 he used uh also Romanian and other couriers to bring these things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Uh it was addressed to the uh <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> of f 1CQ but in reality, and here is a strange thing, Montello opened the the uh the envelope and gave it to uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> who was the exchange telegraph agency or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Uh the agency doesn't exist anymore...one of the uh uh telegraphic agencies which existed at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The fact that he gave this to telegraph agency was, of course, completely unauthorized and really not in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">On the other hand, it was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It uh...for the first time, the swiss censor authorities didn't stop it, and this was not the merit of (laughter) of Montello but the fact that...1t showed that the war had finally changed and the success in the war was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and to our great astonishment, the Swiss let it go. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Uh who has really the merit for this decision, I I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I never found out, but it was a very important step which was then claimed by Montello as as his great success, but let me not touch this claim. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Uh important was the fact that for the first time a detailed report on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> came out, and I would say that before this report, and this is a great merit for these two Slovakian Jews, uh that for the first time this came in the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Also much too late, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Much too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">our understanding, of course, was clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The the terrible things and the people were killed and so on, but the details in which...how this was...I would say, but of course, this was many years ago, and maybe some of it I forgot, but I would say that this was a decisive moment to give us inside knowledge of of how this thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">14
QUESTION: Well...I 1, of course, will not quarrel with your judgment of uh decisive moment, but sometime you and I will talk about some of the earlier documents which came out about AuschwitzBirkenau. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">There are earlier reports, not so detailed...

ANSWER: Now, when when this when when this uh news came and I said the second copy of the Auschwitz report came to the Zionist...to the <span class="BUILDING">Palestine office</span> , and there was added already the statistics of the Jews in the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> who had been killed, who had been uh transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and who were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Uh we...from that moment on when this was clear, and there was really > a very important, concerted political action to save what could still be saved of the Hungarian Jews, and uh at this...in reality F the only political action which was undertaken by the Allies in this respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">By the others and not only by the others . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The F first step I think was undertaken by the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The Swedish section of the World Jewish Congress, had something to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He sent an appeal to , the head of the Hungarian state. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">More important was the action undertaken by the American government, and that is a unique action really. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They uh...the American government addressed a note to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with which it was at war. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">This is unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It's really a break of normal methods, and uh warned them that if they uh...this policy of extermination would go on, the consequences they would have to bear and there was attached a special note, appeal by Roosevelt himself, a statement, in this uh request. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And this was officially transmitted by the Swiss as intermediaries...they they were representing American interests in in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and it was a direct note. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">This certainly made a great impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The fact that the greatest

was also an action by the Pope. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It's the only time that the Pope addressed a telegram direct telegram to to and of the Jewish . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Uh and finally there's the action in which I was also involved uh uh by the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, uh in which was equally addressed personally to to . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">There is in the literature somebody has written about it said that the note was transmitted really very late when the action was practically over. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">That is not the full story in my opinion because because the the legation, the Hungarian legation in in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> was fully informed about this, and they they made this appeal may have reached in direct ways already. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">All this together had a decisive uh uh result and and stopped for a certain time the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Then later there was ..for months we fought against the attempt to to re-introduce the the old policy, and uh this is...these months are really very confu6ed. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There are all the time initiatives to uh continue the action to send people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , to continue to send them to labor and and put them into labor battalions and so on, and the , but as we know today, particularly the uh representative of of the Red Cross in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , two of the finest representatives, were very active and counter-acted these things all the time, 50 I cannot say it was a full success, but I can say there was a real struggle going on, a fight which lasted for months, and we denounced publicly all the negative uh uh features of this fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">In reality, all this...and we...very important was in this respect or 20 to the action of the World Council of Churches which was still in formation, but they had a very uh strong group there, _ and others, and the initiative uh uh was of the World Council with Mark was the president of the International Red Cross, was really done on my request, and I gave him all the uh the documentation and the arguments and and uh I've...we did the I used them too and they were, of course, more successful than we. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">There status was... a very religious person and this 1s today often

QUESTION: Was bureaucracy then one of the basic reasons why the Allies did so little in response to opportunities between...
ANSWER: Let's let's do this in a more systematic way. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But thi6 is one of the factors which have certainly played a role. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">No doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Now we have said uh we have made a survey of what became possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board, but we have left out one, in my opinion, very important aspect, and that is the preservation of the camp inmates at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I must tell you that from I would say probably October nineteen hundred forty-four on, I was...I had an obsession, a real obsession. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I was dread the fearing that at the end...1t was clear that the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It was clear it dragged on, the war dragged on but the the Germans had lost it, but the Germans who used children in the war effort and this was and I personally...maybe it's my education...I was afraid that the last effort in a kind of in Waggoner's context it's ...uh when everything 1s lost, they would at least see to it that the the rest of the Jews who were still alive, they would take them with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And I was absolutely obsessed by the idea that in the last moments they will make a slaughter of the three or four hundred thousand Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which were . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And I couldn't sleep and I told myself, what can we do in order to stop this And I had at a .1 1 33 certain moment the idea, alright let's make a great effort, a joint effort of everybody together, because everybody is in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The French had their inmates in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and the Czechs and the Poles and so on and so on, and I took the initiative to mobilize all the Allied forces in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in order to organize a joint action to prevent this~ It wasn't too easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I was stateless too, without government. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">There was no Israeli government. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">There was no Jewish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">There was no supported, and I took the initiative and I...the first question is who is neutral enough or in good relations with everybody that he could uh play this role, and I decided on the Czechoslovakian government, and I approached the delegate from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at the League of Nations, and invite everybody, the French and the Belgians and the Dutch and the Yugoslav, and the Italian was in the meantime...and the Romanians were also and the Greek, and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And we had our first meeting I think was in November '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I was in uh in 8ern that day and came a little late to the to the meeting, and I was very pleased to see all the representatives either of real government representatives or the representatives of the Red Cross Society offices, <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ...they were all officials practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And uh and when I arrivedt he said the idea comes from Dr. Riegner. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Let him explain to you what what he wants. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And I uh explained to them that we we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and there was a great danger that this would happen, that at the last moments they would really suppress all the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and they were capable of doing it, and 34 we should do a last desperate effort to save this and to prevent this. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we discussed various ways, uh neutral <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> or Red Cross and so on, and the idea...and there was very considerable support, but of course they couldn't decide. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">They had to ask their government, and uh we had several sessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The last session was in in...the decisive session was in I think February. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It went already in the next year because the governments are very slow in replying, and there we all agreed we should ask the International Red Cross for a very special, high-level mission to the political authorities of of of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to prevent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And it was agreed and then these governments, they didn't have all relations between themselves and some didn 't recognize them, but they were all in agreement it should be done, and the idea was therefore not to to sign a joint paper but to...that everybody should submit this identical appeal to the President of the Red Cross uh for this purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And I wrote the text, and uh everybody signed it, and at a certain day between ten and eleven, they all submitted the the signed appeal to the Red Cross, and this led to the last great action of in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where he saw Carlton Brunner who was really the number two under under Himnler. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Now when called together all these people and then when he came back, he called them again together, and I questioned him very, very thoroughly and this is also...I didn't just take his (laughter) assurances for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It opened up a certain number of activities for the Red Cross but I think much more important, it gave to the German government as a clear understanding that the whole Allied, all the 35 Allied governments together were determined not to let this happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And it has...while events precipitated and military and others developed so quickly that all the _ were uh by-passed by new events all the time, so that uh the agreements, the real agreements which were concluded between and the the German Nazis, the moment they were done really already by-passed and the and it's not so important whether they were implemented or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">The the...it it created a decisive fact, political fact, that the the governments did not allow this to happen, and with few exceptions, it didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">There are a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they tried to kill people, and they killed some of them, but relatively limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The action was, on the other hand, supported by the activities of who acted in the same <span class="DLF">line</span> with the on behalf of the Swedish _ and I was in contact, telephone and otherwise, with _ in in in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and we tried at least to to coordinate and inform each other what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I believe that strangely the uh people have dealt with the Holocaust and the...and so the people who got saved and were spared, nobody really mentions this. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I think it's one...I think this is...the War Refugee Board was supporting us very much on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">No doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The American government asked us to keep them informed and at later meetings, they were present. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">At the first meetings they were, I believe, not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">In the later meetings, the British government also was present. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I mean, this was really...<span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and...was was a united front of the whole uh coalition of the Nazi question. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And uh I can only say the the the result was that the life of most of the people 36 0 was respected, which I consider was not a matter which was going without . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It was, by the way, not the only activity which this group undertook. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We alao addressed ourselves in the last days of the war to the Allies, and that they should allow uh columns of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with food and other medical and so to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">They should be not kept out because of military or bureaucratic reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And we had...the the same group intervened with the Allied governments on on on these matters and probably the results were quite positive, the reaction on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Now I believe uh that uh Winston's man like Weinman says that the War Refugee Board saved two hundred thousand people or something such a figure, I I believe this is very questionable. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">All these figures are very questionable. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Uh what _ makes the real uh calculations. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I believe that the saving of the people, the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the last moment is is is one of the most things which we reached, saying this was also a collective effort but I I don't think I exaggerate because I was involved in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I believe really this is...made quite a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Now let me say something about why so little was done and why...what shall I say...why so little was done and why we have this...
QUESTION: ...between November '42 and January of '44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER: Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Well, we didn't save...the the War Refugee Board took eighteen months until the first and the only real action was undertaken and how many millions of people were uh were killed in . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">1 37 the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Now I, of course, have given more thought than most people uh because I was so deeply involved and I tried so hard and why did all this not lead to greater action. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There is a whole series of factors. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I'll may mention them, but I'll come to the end to the most important uh reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Firstly, nobody was really prepared for such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And this shows really the uniqueness of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">That's for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">This had never happened in history, that a whole people including the babies and old people and and invalids and men and women, children, that a whole people was condemned to be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It hasn't happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And with all the catastrophes which have come over Jews during the course of history ...in the course of history, nobody really mentions such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I mean they're just not prepared for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">This is the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">The second is uh the atrocity...atrocity stories of the 1st World War...(break in tape) ...this came up all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">During the Ist World War especially during the occupation by the Germans of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , there came all kinds of stories what the Germans did and after the war it occurred that this was highly exaggerated and a good number of these stories were not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Whenever I came as my reports and so on, I was going against this war. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">they called at that time, and this was a very great handicap for . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I am not trying to underrating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Number three, the secrecy. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">In spite of everything, this was a so- called secret undertaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Uh has rightly said that many many people were involved but officially this was a secret uh operation, and not only was it a secret operation, this was an 38 operation for which a special language was invented which said complete different things which they meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Where the uh ...all this meant meant uh a lot of other words and we are...was invented in order to make it clear that it shouldn't have been clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The the most interesting in this is the the famous speech by Himnler to the...1n '43 to the heads of the SS or...where he said more or less he will never admit it and he action was a great national act of self-defense, but in which he said we will not leave any traces of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I will never admit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION: And yet it was being recorded as he was speaking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER: Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Now I have another letter such in my files by Himnler to Miller who was also one of the top people in the 1n the Third Reich security . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Section 4. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And this is interesting. .. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Uh it's a very strange...a letter in which he refers to a report by Stephen Wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You know this perhaps...
QUESTION: Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER: ...of September nineteen hundred forty-two, in which Stephen Wise must have referred about my famous telegram and the report. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We have never found really to what statement of Wise it refers. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">This 1s something for the for the scholars to to work on. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And there's exactly...and he he he uh he speaks there as if uh of course the the the course of transporting so many people, of 39 course, many people die and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">This is normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And again, don't leave any trace also of the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">It's clear and absolute deliberate effort to to hide the real facts and to eradicate any any traces which could be...it's a strange concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">If they are so proud, why...of their action, why why this secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION: I wrote in my book on Himmler that Himmler was torn by this conflict between the need to conceal, on the one hand, and the need to keep orderly records on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER: Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Now then the next point is we have already talked about it a little bit but I think we should uh talk more about it...the anti-Semitism is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Allied camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Now this is something uh perhaps at this moment where anti-Semitism is growing again in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the world and even in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but the generation the last thirty years, the American Jewish youngsters didn't suffer from anti-Semitism, and they don't...didn't understand that there was a very active anti-Semitic movement in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the '30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Uh those who were feeling this movement were of course the Nazis to a great extent, but you had also your your own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The Nazis with the and their own organization of the which were were appointed in all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to uh develop anti- or Nazi activities and anti-Jewish activities all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Uh but you had your own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Uh there were the the Father Coffmann who who was twice a week I think on the on the on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The television didn't exist at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There was K. 40 D.

ANSWER: All what I have said is...has influenced the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But I believe there are two points which are really decisive. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The first 1s the complete powerlessness of the Jewish people at that time of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It's very difficult for the generation of today to understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">we have today a rather influential Jewish community in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">We have today a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> which is uh has been very successful in the last forty years with militarily, politically, which has had great influence on many understand this, and not to compare the situation of today with the situation forty or fifty years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">That has to be learned and that's one of the most important problems in Jewish education you have to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Today we are a different Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We have learned from the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We have learned from our isolationism. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We have learned that we can and decisive moments only count on . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You cannot apply the ways or or position of organizing uh protests of 1990 and 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The great number of these methods were not available. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">There were certainly not available during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The police would have chased the protesters away from the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> or wherever uh in a in a minute, and the real thing is that we had no influence at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">This is . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And the second uh third truth is that what happened was so terrible and so beyond any human understanding that people really couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I'm saying this meaning both Jews and non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And concurs in one of his books in a very able way exemplified this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">To exterminate a whole people including babies and sick people and...is something, and and and to throw babies into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas ovens</span> , burning the human beings alive and then...is something which we...goes beyond any human understanding and . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And therefore, we have to distinguish between knowing the facts and accepting facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">After the declaration of the Allied governments in December of '42, everybody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And we thought now something will happen, decisively will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But in reality, the people who had under...had signed this declaration had great doubts whether this was really happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And Jews themselves...I would ! : </span><span class="sentence" id="574">47 say that many people who knew, who learned, who spoke about it, had in their inner hearts somewhere a reflection...I hope this is all not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">You cannot...this cannot be true. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I give you a few examples. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">In nineteen hundred forty-three, I got one day from the Union of Polish 3ews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , a package with thirty thousand addresses in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to whom I was supposed to send packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">When I received this package, I got nearly crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">This organization had its seat in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I believe even on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> as the American and World Jewish Congress to whom to whom all my reports went. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They must have read all my reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I asked myself, they have still not understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But it wasn't this. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">They had read it and they had understood it, but they couldn't accept that their own families were included in the . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It cannot be. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">None of these thirty thousand addresses were valid anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They people had been evacuated or had been killed already or had been in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Not one was . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But you couldn't sit 0 and do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">You have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And you're excluded you own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I know that many many people are sacrificed and killed, but not my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">This cannot be true. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And so they collected that something has to be done, so they collected the addresses, and . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">They never got . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I couldn't do anything but here you have the schizophrenic reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Knowing, but not...somehow not believing or taking exceptions for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The story of is well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">It has been often repeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">When when when he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and and and and and uh I can't believe it, and then he said, you mean I ama, 48 liar. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He said no, I didn't say that you are a liar. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But I said I can't believe it. </span><span

down and the next day or two days later and writes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and tells him and and really shares with him his terribly despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">What can one do, but tell the the . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">He <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> he probably did. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I'm sure he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Uh there's another story of uh which was given by Professor de Young, who is one of the authors of the classic work on the uh deportations from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and he was a young man and and and the government of exile in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> during World war IJ, and was in charge of radio emissions, and he gets hold of some of my reports, and he reports in a lecture he gave in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> ...no, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , some time ago, and uh tells the story how he gave these reports to the Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">tells...uh returns these reports a few days later to him and says, you believe in this stuff? </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But worse even, who I made mentioned before who was Secretary General of the World Jewish congress during that last period of the War, uh there was in 1944 in November a great conference called by the World Jewish Congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> which really sets out a post-War program of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">It's a very important document. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Uh it's really...it was the next twenty years what Jewish...the Jewish community in in the world has pursued as goals and so on is defined there. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Astonishing how how good the document is, a very important contribution to Jewish planning and Jewish policies in the post-War. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And goes to a number of ministers . .' </span><span class="sentence" id="615">49 with the delegation of the assembly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> and he meets amongst other people uh the uh Vice Minister of the Defense, McLoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You mentioned him before, and they submit the official documents and tell him to speak about it and so on, and McLoy, a very respected man in the government of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and who played a very important role after the War as a high commissioner in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so on, a lot of other important functions, asked _ to remain behind when the uh delegation retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And he says and there's a report by and it's been published...I don't remember where but I've read it and he said...so McLoy says to him, while now as we are alone you can admit this is all propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">This is December nineteen hundred forty-four, five months before the War was over and the number two man in the government on on the war effort doesn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Now this shows uh there was really the people didn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">This shows that it was so beyond any human (inaudible tape) human conditions, that you couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">this was of

QUESTION: In retrospect..
ANSWER: In retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It means that man cannot live with absolute evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">You cannot accept absolute evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">There is some way E 50 the conviction that man is good, man is pure. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Man is not condemned to the worst, and this...it's a paradox. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">When...many Jews do not like when I say this, because they cannot forget... cannot forget either this , but the fact that man cannot accept this, and man could not accept it, gives you hope in the man of tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It is really the most positive conclusion you can have. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">In this world of darkness, you cannot despair of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION: Let me ask you something about something that was not specifically on your list of things that uh or explanation provided for so little done. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Uh you mentioned the insensitivity of high officials, but you didn't talk specifically about President Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">You probably know that uh some of the books on the subject, particularly David Weiman's book uh Single Out Roosevelt is is a major factor, perhaps the major factor. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Tell us a little bit about your assessment of Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Well, it's of course very difficult for my generation to to make a final judgment on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">We work...we uh uh were educated in uh in a world and this was where it was the only hope, and later judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Uh and of course the study of uh the war record of the American government shows that uh all kinds of opportunities were lost and were not used, and the political responsibility is certainly borne by Roosevelt to a great extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">But on the other hand, he is the only one who can say...uh could say that this policy has also prevailed, to preserve some Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I spoke of lend I ; 51 lease. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Lend-lease has saved probably <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and probably more than <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I think that this _ thanks to lend and lease and the...of course the resistance of the British people that they survived, and with this survival, four hundred thousand Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> have been saved from the invasion of of the Nazis and would have been victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But another conservation is even more important. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">If <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> would have gone under, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> would have gone under. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was very near that the Nazis came into <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">There are six hundred thousand Jews and much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Can you imagine that the Nazis would have wiped out the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1942 or '3 or '4. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Our whole world...our whole Jewish world wouldn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">With the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> today is a powerful factor for every aspect of Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">That's also due to the Allied effort and Roosevelt had an important stake in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">That doesn't mean that I'm not...I'm defending and the inactivity. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I think he bears a great responsibility but he and Churchill are the only ones who on the other hand have also contributed to the preservation of the free world, and that cannot be completely forgotten either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION: A couple of times we've mentioned in passing the role of the uh the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> and the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Uh it seems to be in this section about why was so little done, uh we need to come back to them and talk a bit more about . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Perhaps what they did, but also what they could have done and did not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">| 52
QUESTION:  Well, on the <span class="BUILDING">vatican</span> I have once given a great lecture on the <span class="BUILDING">vatican</span> and on the World Council of Churches. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Uh they have...there has been very little done. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Uh I spoke, I believe, of the memorandum which we gave to the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> in nineteen hundred forty-two, and the only result of this was uh that some action was taken with regard to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and the deportations of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> were interrupted, stopped for a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">This was a Catholic priest who was at the head of the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Uh in all the...I have spoken on the action taken in in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> and here I believe that the <span class="BUILDING">vatican</span> and the the Nuncio who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> has tried to and cooperated with the general effort to preserve the Jewish community, and even the local bishops and uh were influenced in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But generally speaking, the situation depended on this the personal courage and the personal determination of the leaders in the various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And you have examples of courage and determination and you have examples of complete uh laissez-faire. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Some of the bishops and archbishops...you have beautiful examples in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> like Cardinal of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulousse</span> , who went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where the deportations from where the deportations took place, and his presence was an act of protest. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">There were some other bishops...Bishop , Bishop .. , but there were also other cardinals who supported the vichary regime fully, and the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> never interfered even in the French anti-Jewish legislation when it was asked whether..of his opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> in my opinion, and there there are twelve or thirteen volumes of vatican documents what uh what they were doing | 53 during the War, I believe that the real problem in the catastrophe of the...which happened to us was never taken seriously by the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> until the War was practically over, and I believe that there was no real realization in the highest uh levels of the Vatican bureaucracy, uh no real evaluation of the out...of of the the the dimensions of the catastrophe, and I believe that the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> was better informed maybe than we believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">There are hundreds and hundreds of priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">and we were not prevented from and there are books who report on this, on these reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">In the official documentation, it shows that some uh priests reported very clearly about the about the elimination of the Jews and the killing of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">When prohibited Wise to publish my famous it was agreed that they should ask opinion of the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> and the opinion of the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> was very wishywashy. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They said we have also reports but uh it doesn't...on on that treatment, but they didn't confirm the elimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Astonishingly, because , the who reports regularly to the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> and who writes about the same time the new things are the bombardments of the state, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , and the uh increased elimination and extermination of the Jews and there are already more than two million exterminations. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So one cannot tell me they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Uh in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the local bishops helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">The action of the <span class="BUILDING">vatican</span> centrally was practically limited to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">There they tried a certain influence, but otherwise I wouLd say there was no real great concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And uh I often uh thought that my long conversation with uh with Monseigneur Montini 54 in 1945 when the war was over and I was asked to plead with him the Catholic authorities should help us to recuperate the Jewish children who had been hidden by Catholic authorities or Catholic individuals and when I argued with him...this was November 1945...and said that we had...we were very grateful to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> for what it had done in order to save some Jews, Jewish children especially, but we had lost in the war one and a half million Jewish children, and we couldn't loose one more child. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He questioned me, he questioned this statement and was absolutely astonished when I gave him the statistical background to my _ . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">For twenty minutes we argued. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I told him, you know, there were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...the birthrate...was a birthrate...a Jewish birthrate of sixty thousand every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Multiply by 16, 16...you can...you arrive at 960,000 children, up to the age of sixteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We should have in 1945 at the end of the War, found 960,000 Jewish children in <span

QUESTION: Hierarchy...
ANSWER: Hierarchy...the the Catholic hierarchy, had to learn from me to realize in November when it was 1945, what this meant, this shows that uh not very high priority was given to these problems in the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> , and uh the other example is I mentioned already several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">He went to the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> in August nineteen hundred forty-two...uh '45, supported by some very important Catholic uh scholars, including Jack who became later the cardinal, became the French Ambassador to the Holy See, a very important, very distinguished Catholic scholar, including uh the uh priest in in in uh who became a cardinal later whose name escapes me at the moment, who has written a very important book also in Catholic-Jewish relations, including uh a prelate of Egyptian-Jewish origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">A whole series of very uh distinguished Catholic theologians and they argued that this was a time for the Holy See to issue a Jewish on the relations with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">There was no reply, and it took twenty years until vatican Council 56 II that the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> really found that it had to issue a statement on the future of Christian-Jewish relations, a very important statement . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">It's a beginning of a new approach to the Jews, but you see here the.. all these indications show that certainly the Jewish catastrophe was not seized in all its terrible dimensions and it had certainly not priority in the considerations of the <span class="BUILDING">vatican</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION: What about the role of the International Red Cross?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER: The International Red Cross, you have today a very important study by Professor , uh the Geneva historian who has...is the only one who had access to all the files, and the result of this study is not very positive to say the least. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">There are two positive things which I have to say sbout the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">The one is the fact that uh , Vice President, concerned to us in 1942 that he had also news about uh the final solution and that he had heard from several German diplomatic witnesses that the final solution was in in execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">This was a positive, a very positive fact for us to determine and to inform the Allies that this was a reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">The second is the negotiations which I mentioned before with and certainly contributed to to help prevent the extermination of the people who were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at the end of the war, but apart from this, the attitude of the Red cross was uh not very helpful, and not very uh courageous. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">There was a moment when some of the members of the Red Cross really 57 felt they had to make an open protest against amongst other things the treatment of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Uh or at least an appeal in which these matters would be open...openly denounced but uh it never came to this appeal or public protest. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It's...although I must admit there was a majority of the members of the International Committee who were in favor of such . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But here the Swiss government intervened and prevented any such declaration. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Uh I've been often asked whether this should have happened or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">In my opinion, there are moments for international organizations, welfare organizations, where you have to speak out, and I was asked by the Red Cross at the time...I clearly recommended and pushed and was very active in order to that such a statement of denunciation should happen, but it didn't happen and was prevented, as I said, by the swiss government which was afraid of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Uh but nevertheless, at certain moment our insistence of decisive action had some result. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">There was in 1942, in September '42, and the dates are very important because this is the moment where we informed uh _ that we knew about the final solution and he confirmed to us that he knew too. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Uh there the Red Cross sent a memorandum to their delegation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in which uh they left it to the decision of the delegation if they should uh submit to the German authorities uh a request for the extension of the basic rules of Red cross protection to the intern...1nterned people in the various camps and not in the camps of prisoners of war and the other camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Uh this activity, this action had no consequences. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">That was the most serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">They kept me in the belief for two I 58 years that they were pushing on this constantly and there were always new interventions in this sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">This is just not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">'s book makes it very clear that until the uh situation developed in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in 1945 which we have described, practically nothing has has happened, and this is in my opinion a very serious mistake and uh very serious failure of the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Moreover, the book of _ brings out a number of very unpleasant facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">For instance, the Red Cross accepted without protest a request of the German Red Cross that...I think it's 1941...1t could be '42...that in the future inquiries about people who are lost...who are searched for, should in the future be submitted separately for aliens and non-aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">That they accepted this distinction is certainly a scandal and certainly not in the line of uh Red Cross principles, and there are a number of other such incidents which are certainly not very good and show also the the very limited courage which the Red Cross had in countering the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">There's a historian who has...a Swiss historian, Mr. Paul Stouffer, who has denounced this attitude in an article concerning the case of . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">The twelve thousand Polish officers were murdered by the...by Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">At the time, the uh German government and the Polish government in exile both asked the International Red Cross to establish an inquiry commission in order to determine who was responsible for this act. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Uh behind all this was the government...was the propaganda ministry and uh the Red Cross could not accept the proposal because the third party hadn't and the third party were the Russians, and according to the principles of ! </span><span class="sentence" id="731">59 the Red Cross only when all involved could agree...could such a question could such an inquiry commission be established, but Mr. Stouffer refers in this respect to the diaries of . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Uh of course, the Germans were very upset that this inquiry commission didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Uh but in the diaries of uh he defends himself and says we couldn't make a big fuss about this case. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We are much too much depending on the International Red Cross concerning our own interests with regard to prisoners of war and other other interned people in <span class="REGION">Allied countries</span> and so on, which shows exactly that the Red Cross disposed of higher prestige and status in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when they believed themselves and all their hesitations not to insist too much with the Germans because of the overwhelming power of the Germans, uh it..at the time is here really contradicted by one of the greatest witnesses one could produce in which it said we depend on the good will of the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">This has never been taken serious and never been realized but by the responsible people in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So the Red Cross today doesn't anymore really defend this position. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">For the first time under the new president there, , I saw recently articles in which they said yes, we didn't do enough at the time, but now we have another policy and so on so. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And this is in a not the attitude uh of the deal on these matters much more in detail in my own autobiography. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I was very much involved in the whole theater of Red Cross activities, and the book by you see day by day for how I pressured the Red Cross into action in the Hungarian uh case and uh also in's book, there are I think 45 references I 60 to my activities uh but it was certainly a very important activity also from our <span class="NPIP">side</span> and some of it produced results but, of course, much too limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION: We have a little less than ten minutes to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I was going to ask you about uh relations with the Jewish agency and the Joint, but if you have something that you would rather say that has not come out yet, please feel free to take this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER: No, we can speak about the the the nations that say they cooperation of the Jewish organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I'm not speaking now on the on the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Uh there have been very little described really. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We were not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">With the agency I had very good relations with the head of the agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , , who was an old diplomat of the Zionist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">He was even more pessimistic than I was, and so pessimistic that he really gave up doing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">He has written enormous amount of letters in describing his despair, which 1s...I didn't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I uh was afraid partly of the censorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Everything which we wrote went through censorship and I didn't want the , but uh there was...cooperation was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">There were all kinds of uh little <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> between which there was a good deal of jealousy, but while I was at the time upset by some of these personal problems, when you see it as a whole and it didn't make any difference on the whole scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Uh the the Germans were so uh powerful whether we would have _ a little better together or not, wouldn't have made 61 any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">The Joint is another chapter. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The Joint gave instructions not to cooperate with . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Had instructions from the Joint in in , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , not to cooperate with us which was due to the uh competition between the World Jewish Congress in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which pursued rescue activities on its own and based on the collections in <span class="REGION">South America</span> and the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">My criticism with regard to the Joint is very clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Until very late they did not see that this was not just a general welfare undertaking which was necessary but a special political rescue action. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">This they understood very ...and rescue and philotropic (ph) welfare is quite a different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The Joint even opposed Martin Goldman's proposal to the...Goldman was a man who had great ideas and great schemes. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He had..in the war, during the war, two great ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">The one was to approach the Allies and to take...to ask them to ask them that the Allies should offer to the German government to take the totality of Jews into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Allied camp</span> , and to evacuate and the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> would care for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">This, of course, was a revolutionary idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It was probably the only great idea uh that could be conceived, but it was immediately rejected by the British . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">The other idea was the constructive idea of a basic joint effort to rescue, and he proposed five...a fund of five million dollars of contribution from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , five million dollars contribution from uh United...from uh <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and two million from the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">This was sabotaged by the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">The Joint was against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">The Joint was believing that they had a kind of monopoly on Jewish defense and and and Jewish welfare activities,. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">1 62 and the government shouldn't interfere. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">It was an absolute basic mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">When the war was over, our greatest asset was that we we succeeded in in convincing the Allied governments, the UN, to participate and take the responsibility for the surviving refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">The was based was based and financed by the governments, not by the Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">The UNDRA effort was based and here the World Jewish Congress had an important role in in uh introducing this idea and this concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">The the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were in need was not the responsibility of private people. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was the responsibility of the uh world community, which had not conducted world affairs in the way which could have saved these people, and so uh both in number and both in the uh international refugee organization after the war, the responsibility of governments and the financial responsibility of the basic needs was recognized and we should have done it, of course, during the World uh World War II, but the the Jewish were not yet right for such a concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Today it is absolutely obvious that private organizations, private citizens, can only contribute to it, but the the basic needs and the basic policies have to be financed by governments and international intergovernmental organizations in order to keep the basic needs covered. ..</span></p>
