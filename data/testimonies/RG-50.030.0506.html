ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  It’s very nice to see you, Mr. Belfer, after all these months of talking on the phone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  And very good to be with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Tell me, what was your name when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My Polish name was Roman, and my Hebrew name was Avraham Yashuah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And your last name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Belfer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Belfer. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And you’re now known as?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  As Robert Alexander Belfer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  And where’d the Alexander come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  My cousin, one of my mother’s sister’s children, married a fellow by the name of Shie Faigel, and he also was a Yashuah and he changed the name to Alexander. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So I felt that it was appropriate as an American to have a middle name, so I followed his example.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  In March 27" of 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  I was born in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hajow</span> in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> where -- near the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , where my parents happened to be living briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  But you weren't raised there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  I was re -- raised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And what did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  My father was a processor of feathers and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He would buy the raw feathers from Polish farmers, separate the feathers from the down and then market them separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> that did the separation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And did your mother work as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Bef -- my mother worked in her family’s <span class="BUILDING">travel office</span> , and my father, as a result of his business, marketing the feathers and downs, did a lot of traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So he happened to visit <span class="BUILDING">travel office</span> , and he found what he thought was an attractive young gal, he courted her and married her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  So she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  And do you remember the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where you were living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  It was --
QUESTION:  Or the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  It was, I believe, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And from what I remember it was quite a -- a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from the perspective of a very young child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Now I know that your -- your dad left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when? </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Was it after the war started, do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Or do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Yes, I do know. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Okay, on August 23", 1939, when the Soviets and Nazis signed a non- aggression pact, there was the fear of war in the <span class="DLF">air</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">This was particularly true with respect to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">When the Nazis got into power, they established all kinds of trade restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My father was exporting feathers to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">While he was visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he was arrested, allegedly for breaking their trade ru-rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He was able to post bail, and he actually jumped bail. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So he knew that if Nazis ever got into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that he would be picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">With the encouragement of my mother who said to him that if you are in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you will be arrested, if you’re out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you may be he -- able to help us, she encouraged him to promptly leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It being late August, my father’s parents, being religious, said, the high holidays are coming, you should wait and leave until after the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Well, my father left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdynia</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> in late August, with the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to leave a <span class="DLF">Polish port</span> before the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  While he was in the middle of the Atlantic, September first came along, with the outbreak of the war, and clearly, if he had listened to his parents rather than his wife, I wouldn’t be here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Now, you s -- you were very young, so do you have any recollections from your own memory of your father leaving? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Do you remember that day, or --
ANSWER:  I remember that my father would take a number of trips, but I can’t tell you at this point that I remember this departure. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He had previously gone to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , where s -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was going, on -- on a -- business trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So I think to my young mind, the difference between this business trip and other business trips, was not apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Do you remember feeling any anxiety in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because of a possible war and then the war coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Do you -- do you have a recollection of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Well, my recollection is that when the war came, we fled to my father’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , ni -- which was relatively close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">In my own mind, and perhaps this 1s fantasizing, I think of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span> as being the Anna Tefka. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And as -- so we felt it being a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , it was a quote, safer <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be with the Nazis swarming all over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  So it was you and your mother, your two sisters, and anyone else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span> , we were with my father’s extended family, his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He was one of seven children, there were three boys and four girls, and my father was the oldest, and so there were a lot of Belfers around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  And you know, some of them had children, and I suspect that there were, you know, close family friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So I do remember that one night when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the night on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , somehow feeling that that was safer than staying in our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">That there was the noise of artillery in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I am told a story about myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me, but it doesn’t, that apparently in the middle of the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and just relieved myself to the expense of a sleeping neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  And who told you this story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  My parents, and my sisters would tease me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Now, you had two older sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Can you give us their names, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Yes, there was my sister Selma who was three years older, and my sister Anita who was just one year older than I.
QUESTION:  Do you remember them in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Do you remember being with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Well, I remember that my sister Anita, who was then called Hanka by her Polish name, had a nanny maid by the name of Topja. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And apparently Topja wa -- who was su -- probably supposed to be looking after all three of us, seemed to favor Hanka, or Anita. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Also remember being told that when she was two and I was one, that I was as big as she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And, by the way, I was told that I was a 10 pound baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Obviously I can’t prove it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That’s pretty big.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  And that I was a much better eater, you know, and that I would eat the food off Hanka’s plate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  With her permission, or you simply went there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Well, she would, I think ha -- was happily acquiescing at being relieved of the burden of eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Having grandchildren of various temperaments --
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  -- I know some of them are more like I-I am, and some are more like my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Let me go back for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You -- because not everybody who watches this will know what you meant when you said -- when you went to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it was like Anna Tefka to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  That it would be a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">east European village</span> with largely unpaved <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and probably chickens running around the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and most of the men being bearded, and Yiddish being spoken --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  -- much more so than Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  And Anna Tefka actually refers to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 1n a musical, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Yes, that’s -- it is the name of the -- a fictional <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in “Fiddler on the Roof.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Which of course has now become an American icon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Your -- where did your father go when he left? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He didn’t get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Wa -- he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  He did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">By that -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat on</span> which he was on sailed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He was permitted entry to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a business person on a business visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">While he was in the middle of the Atlantic, the zlotys, the Polish currency that he had with him became worthless overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  When he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , he was given five dollars by HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and -- in order to have the wherewithal to get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And he made contact, reme -- as I said before, he had been to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  He had business contacts, and they initially helped him out and he went to work for them, initially as an employee, and he shou -- he shortly became their partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Because he was aware that the war had actually broken out, and because wars create scarcity, when he used his business contacts to send cables to -- which was the pre-internet way of communicating --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  -- to Europe, asking for quotations on feathers and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And whatever quote he got, which was then above the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , he responded yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When the merchandise arrived, and the fact of the war had been more widely recognized, the feathers and downs had appreciated in value, he was able to then sell them at a profit and get started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Now, was he able to communicate with your -- with your mother and the family at all, do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  There -- the mail service was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I think that there was an exchange of letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I don’t -- don’t believe there was any telephones --
QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  -- that time that were functioning on a <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- to <span class="REGION">occupied Poland</span> --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  -- relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  You don’t have those letters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  No, I do not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So how long was you father in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, the -- my -- because he had a business visa, rather than an immigration visa, he had -- he applied as a hardship case as a refugee from a occupied country. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But he had to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and -- to be permitted to re-enter the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on an immigrant status. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Obviously with the war raging in Europe, he was happy to be able to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> 
QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Now, in the meantime, your mother is trying to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Now, in the meantime my father was preoccupied not only with trying to make a buck, but getting his family out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And he had with him -- and I’m hoping I can actually get you a copy of what I would call a life-saving photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was a picture of his wife and three children that he had with him, and utilizing that picture, and -- let’s just say the cooperation of the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> of the Republic of <span class="COUNTRY">Nicaragua</span> , he was able to obtain for his family, citizenship papers of <span class="COUNTRY">Nicaragua</span> , then a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My mother won -- who was a little bit older than my father, grew up when there was no <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and so she spoke a perfect Hoke Deutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the Germans -- I mean, I can go into some detail about her contacts with them, did not speak Spanish, and so she conversed with them as a citizen of a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , not as a Jew, not as a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">To the best of my knowledge, she ne -- we never had to wear yellow stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So she’s communicating in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  So as -- as the holder of a citizenship papers of <span class="COUNTRY">Nicaragua</span> , she applied to leave the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">She was told that in order to leave the Third Reich, that she had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But if I may, there are a couple of things that I do remember before our departure for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Absolutely, tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, I remember that it snowed a lot, and that I remember holding my mother’s hand as we walked the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and the way that snow gets shoveled into piles on the edge of the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , it seemed to me as a little kid that the piles of snow were as tall as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I remember that if we would walk in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and we’d come across Nazi s-soldiers, that well, you could -- my -- my mother would definitely show fear which I could feel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Cause you were holding her hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  So did she grab you tightly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  I think she -- I think that she would hold onto me a little tighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Now, I have shown you some pictures of myself, probably taken in the summer of ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And modesty aside, I had blue eyes, and blonde golden curls. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And there was a fear that the Germans would take some eastern European children who looked like Aryans, take them away from their family and raise them as Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So my mother cut ou -- had all my hair cut off to make me look less enticing to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My hair never grew back blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I’m sure it wouldn’t have -- it would have turned color anyway, but it’s a story that I mi -- that I kind of enjoy telling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Did she actually cut off all your hair?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  I can’t say that I have any pictures of myself post haircut, so I can’t give you a precise answer, but certainly you can see from the photos I have, that I had an abundance of golden curls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Which were cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Do you remember seeing these Nazi soldiers when you were walking? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Or do you only remember your mother’s response, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  So -- I know I remember seeing Nazi soldiers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and subsequently when we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  So I can’t be sure --
QUESTION:  Where, yeah, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  -- just where I saw them --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  -- but I certainly do remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Also, I miss -- I -- I also remember very clearly my -- a German officer would knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , accompanied by one or two soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And they would refer to my mother, who spoke perfect German, as [indecipherable] frau, gracious lady, which was the appropriate way to greet a respected stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And they would come and borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> for the duration of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">In short, they stole it. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And because there was this polite officer, you know, who request -- or looked very tall to me, as did most adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  I -- you know, didn’t get any sense of fear out of it, but I do remember, you know, these visits where, you know, there was no sense of compensation or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The Germans took whatever they wanted to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  I also remember two other things from pre-war Poland, and that is that we used to visit my father’s parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span> , and I remember his brothers, including one of them, Norman, who is still alive and in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , playing with me and picking me up and standing me on top of a very tall dresser and I just thought this was, you know, very exciting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  And you know, so a family was a very big part of -- of our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  I also remember that in summers we would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span> in [indecipherable] <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> , as a family and while I don’t have specific recollections, it kind of rings of a pleasant memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So it’s understandable as a young kid, you have these vague -- certain very specific memories, but th-the history is much vaguer for you.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  -- what I’ve said here. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Now, after the war started, I do remember that my sister S-Selma, who used to go and play in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with her cousin, who also was Hanka, and was the daughter of my mother’s brother, so her name was Hanka Annisfeld, and she was no longer allowed to go to play in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I suspect I wasn’t either. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And normally I would have been starting <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , probably that September, but with the outbreak of the war, whatever formal schooling I might have had was deferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Were you -- did your two sisters go with you and your mother when she was going to the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> to try to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Did you know --
ANSWER:  I -- I think that you -- see, to try and -- and clarify, we -- we were able to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  We were put up at a mother -- at a mother and <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> [indecipherable] kinderheim, and while we were there, my -- my mother would take me to visit one <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> after another to try and get visas so that we could leave the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I suspect I was not as well behaved as I should have been, so rather than leaving me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I could be annoying our neighbors, and just sort of realize that here I was speaking Polish, and all our neighbors were German and they obviously weren’t too crazy about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And so it would have been rather risky to antagonize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So I went with her, generally by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , and I remember being on the [indecipherable] and my two sisters, who are only slightly older than I was, were left to stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Cause they were quieter than you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Yeah, they were better behaved than I was, and I’m not quite sure how they occupied their time. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But in any case, they -- they stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> while I went with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I might add that while we were -- the first visas that we were able to obtain was to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and then hopefully the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">To put this in a chronological time frame, we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> in March of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">When I saw the movie, “Schindler’s List,” I realized that we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> a week or two before all the Jews were rounded up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">ve always wondered whether we weren't very lucky in getting out just in the nick of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I mention the chronology because we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for a total of four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Was not a -- a quick or easy st - stay from March through July of ’41, and as -- as -- on June 22™ of ’41, we were getting ready to leave for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarosa, and that avenue of exit was closed to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We subsequently were able to get permission to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and that’s -- that’s a-another chapter. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But before I leave this, and the RAF would come over most every night and drop bombs on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They had no idea where the bombs were dropping. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was more like a -- an annoyance, but it meant that just about every night, we would have to go down to <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And I remember there was at least one time when a bomb fell pretty close to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were and that needless to say, shook up pe -- shook up the people mo -- in more than one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Getting up in the middle of the night and going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> seemed more like adventure to me --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  -- you know, and I -- now that I think back, I wonder how the Germans who were in the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> with us, felt about this foreign family who was in their midst. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The only thing I can say is that I don’t recall any act of verbal or physical harassment. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">To that extent I will say that I appreciated the, shall we say, self discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  But it is, you know, something that I quite clearly remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Did they know that you were Jewish, or do you think they thought that you were Polish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  [had -- I regret that I didn’t ask that very question to my mother, because only my mother could give a definitive answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I will say this, we did not have to have any 1 -- wear yellow stars or anything else that identified us as -- you know, physically as being Jewish, and that my mother did speak this perfect German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  So -- and realize that there were German immigrants who had moved to Central and <span class="REGION">South America</span> , I mean particularly <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And so we could have been -- possibly been viewed as Germans who moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Nicaragua</span> , temporarily ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and were going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Again --

<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Well, I know that we spent a lot of time going from one <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> to the next, and because most children that age were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I wasn’t, I have a bit of a hard time figuring out what it was that I was doing with my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It may be that because my nights were interrupted by going down to the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> , that I may have slept more during the day, but otherwise I suspect I quote, played with my sisters, and I know that since Polish was the only language I could speak, I certainly wasn’t playing with the other kids who happened to have been around.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  It wasn’t a -- you know, lux-luxury apartment, but we weren’t, you know, living in depravation. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And I wish I could tell you how I spent my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It certainly became a lot -- I have a lot clearer picture what I was doing when I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Let me backtrack just a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  But I was desperate to become an American, and so I willed myself to forget Polish, if you can [indecipherable] grasp that concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And so that summer we were sent to a -- a sleep-away camp called unserkamp inkindervelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I would say that it was the extreme left wing of Jewish Socialism. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I laugh when I think back on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The following September, I was sent to the Crown Heights Yeshiva, and my two sisters stayed at P.S. 241, and were given piano lessons; it seemed appropriate for girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They hated piano lessons, I hated the Yeshiva.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  You couldn’t switch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  No, I-I wasn’t given the choice, and so here I was taking three and a half hours of Hebrew in the morning and four hours of English in the afternoon and somehow I was trying to learn English the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I can’t tell you how it worked out, but it did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Why did they send you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> , do you think?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  And what’d they say, it’s too bad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Well, I had this checkered past where in the third grade I switched for one semester to P.S. 241, and then I went back to the Yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And then I should -- remember you asked me about my recognition of the war, and it has -- two things come to my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">One 1s that we were big Roosevelt fans. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Back -- I even remember in 1944 that when he ran for re-election, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Roosevelt cavalcade</span> went right up <span class="DLF">Washington Avenue</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But the Hebrew teachers thought that Roosevelt was an anti-Semite because he didn’t allow more Jews into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So we had this feeling -- this sense, you know, that bad things were happening to Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">The other thing that you asked, when did I really get the recognition of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I remember coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in August of ’45, and my father was sitting on a camp trunk and crying because he had just gotten a telegram that his parents had died during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Then in ’46, my Uncle Norman showed up, together with his brother Maurice, and while Maurice went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , Norman stayed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , got himself a little tan <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Oldsmobile convertible</span> wi-with red leather <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and I thought he was real cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">By that time he was speaking Italian and I think he kind of, you know, had the glow of It-Italian chic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  But I was turning aware that most of my family had not survived the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And wh-what did that do to you, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  I think it certainly gave me a -- a sense of identity, you know, of being -- of being Jewish, of being very supportive of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I remember, I guess, that November 47 vote in the U.N. on- on partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> as th -- as something very specific. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It was -- it was a historic event that I can say I have a contemporaneous recollection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And you were 12.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So you -- you were saying that you have a vivid recollection of the 1947 -- the vote to form a state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Do you then, as you get a bit older, you’re then 12, in your teenage years or in your early 20’s, do you start reading about the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Or is -- does that come later? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Or do you not even feel the need to because you went through it in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Because so many members of my family perished in the Holocaust, I’d have to read about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  I mean, I was on the periphery of it, and did sort of reinforce this. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">My mother had a sister Dora, who married a Dutchman by the name of Joel Grajower, that’s G-r-a-j-o-w-e-r, and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Dora did not survive the war, but Joel and their four children, who had been in what ha -- what -- I think been in the <span class="REGION">Caribbean</span> during the war, came -- visited us in new -- 1-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> in 1946, and lived with us actually, for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they made us very conscious of the fact that they were displaced persons, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And so we were -- we were living that. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We -- we were living the detrious of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We have to read about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  And your Uncle Norman, did he talk about his experiences when he came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  Y-Yes --
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  -- I mean, you know, that he -- I heard his experiences in detail, but it’s been over the years, so it’s hard for me to just say this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  But certainly, I mean, I remember him telling me that at one point he and his older brother Maurice were on one of these death marches when they were moved from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And that when somebody would drop from exhaustion, they were presumed dead, and their bodies would be thrown on the back of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and then buried, you know, in due course. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And so my Uncle Maurice fell down, was thrown on the back of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and then his younger, more rigorous brother Norman literally took him down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death truck</span> , you know, and revived him. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And you know, that’s about as bad as it gets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Do you recall anti-German -- I don’t know whether to call it propaganda or -- ways in which the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> portrayed the Germans once -- once you came here, and then after the war, was there a -- a lot of talk about how horrible the Nazis were, or other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  Well, within the Jewish world, where -- which was where I basically lived, you couldn’t say nu -- bad things about the Nazis often enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  And there was just this feeling that this was the greatest calamity that had ever befallen the Jewish people in our 3200 years of history, and that it was shocking that cultured Europeans, and the Germans, who are certainly viewed as being in that category, could act in such a bestial manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  When did you start reading English newspapers, do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Or American newspapers.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  So does that mean you read papers as soon as you could read?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  And was by -- by that time I was -- I must have picked up the language quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I think that kids are much more facile at doing that than trying to pick up a language at a later age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Did your mother speak English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  She had to learn it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">It must have been great to be a family again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  It wa -- it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Was there a conflict when you were in the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> and hearing about what happened to the Jews, and then in the newspapers you’re reading primarily about the war, which is not about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and all the horrors that the Nazis committed against Jews a-and other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Was there a conflict in you about what’s going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  Yes, because I thought that my teachers, who -- at the Yeshiva, several of whom were rabbis, were being too critical of my adopted <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that I loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And that they weren’t looking at it from the American point of view.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  But I was always glad to have had the benefits of the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> education without having the acute anxieties that many of my classmates had, because their standing in the class could very well determine the career track that they would be on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  And she was wondering whether -- what my level of interest was, since I wasn’t asking her out Saturday nights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  I had met her the previous August. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">By the time the spring came, she went to an extended trip to Europe with her family, and when she came back, she was wearing much brighter colored clothing, and I found that very attractive, and so I said to her, I said, “You know, I like -- you look so well in these colors.” </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And she said, “Well, you know I used to deliberately wear dark colors because you’re -- you’re a Harvard man.” </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I assured her that --

<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And I understand you’d like to be able to say something as we -- as we close the interview, so I want to give you an opportunity to say what it is that you want to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Well, my two older grandsons, George and Andrew Malkin are wonderful boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich</span> with their parents, and go to Greenwich Country Day, a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that is over -- overwhelmingly non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">My old -- oldest grandson George wrote a paper about my European experiences and background. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">He asked me to appear before his history class to [indecipherable] my -- my experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And at this point his younger brother Andrew is expecting me in a few weeks, and anxiously looking forward to sharing my European background experiences with his classmates, and I feel that their interest in my background 1s something that I would like to share not only with them, but with my other three living grandchildren, and hopefully more grandchildren that come down the pike, and possibly even their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I’m appreciative of having this opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  What is it you really want them to know, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  I want them to know that -- how fortunate they are to be living in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , to be living in a comfortable environment, to recognize that being Jewish is a privilege and a burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It is something that you can retain in your heart almost separate and apart from wh-whatever rituals you practice or don’t practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">That it also represents a caring of family, of loyalty to each other, of the ability to handle adversity. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So I think that there’s a -- much to be learned from what others went through, to hope that you don’t have adversity, but that when you do, well we all have bumps in our <span class="DLF">road</span> , you keep a sense of perspective.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  And the Holocaust acts as a way of keeping a sense of perspective, you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  Certainly the Holocaust as an abstract concept is hard to transmit. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But when you realize that you come from a family that had actively, even at -- to an extent peripherally participated in the Holocaust, it gives you an -- a sense of -- of immediacy, and intimacy, which you can’t otherwise get.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you’d like to say about your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  While bad things have happened to me overall, I’m an extraordinary lucky person and appreciative as I said of this opportunity to share part of my history with my family and anybody else who 1s interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Well, thank you very much for giving of your time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  Okay, and Robert, what is this?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Is this after your hair was cut?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  No, I still -- I think that my hair -- no, my hair wasn’t cut until after the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Okay, and who 1s this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  This is a picture of my sister Selma, who 1s probably about seven and a half at the time, and her younger sister Hanka, or Anita, who was five and a half, aboard horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I suspect this was the summer of 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  And which one is Selma?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  Selma is the one on the right, the o-older one. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Notice they are both wearing these big bows in their hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I imagine that that was the in style in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  Okay [indecipherable] these.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  This is a picture of my parents, Arthur and Rochelle Belfer, taken in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">It was probably taken in 1939, shortly before my father left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , never to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Do I need to mention my name, or do I se -- just say it’s me?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  It is a picture of Bob Belfer at his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">You may notice that my hair is a lot shorter and a lot darker than it was in the previous pictures that you’ve seen of me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  This is a photograph of my father, Arthur Belfer, taken about 1990, or about three years before he passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">He is looking very distinguished to me, and clearly a man of great wisdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  This -- this photograph is of my darling wife René and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I suspect it was taken about 10 years ago, which would make it 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I would say that René has aged very little since then.</span></p>
