<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  I was just a few months old when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koma</span> , and we transferred to .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  What did your father do and what was life like in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My father had a law degree just as his father had a law degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">At the time he was a Municipal Secretary, which in...uh...Italian administrative life was a very important position.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I went as a volunteer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  How old were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  I think twenty-five.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  And how long...how long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Two and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  When you come back from the Spanish Civil War, what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">What was your work? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Do you go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  I started working in a <span class="BUILDING">trade firm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">This firm had its <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and I worked however in many Italian cities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belluno</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> , and eventually traveled overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">This firm dealt with...uh...with importing food stuff, especially...uh...livestock and process meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  What happened to you and to your business as war approached?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Well, the war started almost immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I started working for this company at the end of 1939, and the war started in September 39, so it started immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">However, it didn't start for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> entered the war on June 10th, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  And when the war broke out, just tell us...take your time...tell us what happened to you and what you did in the early years of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I continued to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I didn't get involved in the war because I had an official function with the Italian State because this company imported livestock and process meat from <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Did you come into contact with any Jews at that time or did you know anything about what was happening to Jews in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Uh...Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ...uh...nothing was happening at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I had some Jewish friends that I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with and I saw them until 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">However, there were some laws in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and because of these laws, Italians...Italians of Jewish faith preferred to immigrate to overseas, such as <span class="REGION">Central America</span> and <span class="REGION">North America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  When did it begin to change for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh...When did you begin to need to move out of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and the business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Things started changing immediately in December of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Actually, that was June in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I started traveling overseas places such as <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Just tell us then what happened in your words as it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  If you're referring to the situation of the Italian Jews, nothing was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> except for those racial laws, which limited the professional in their trade activities, and therefore, they preferred to immigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">However, everyone was free and you could go to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and bars any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">However, we did have information and news that the situation is <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as far as the persecution of Jews was concerned was very bad starting in 1939, and with the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the persecution escalated and it also escalated in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">These, of course, things that we all heard, but I saw it with my own eyes in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Of course, in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> , King Boris...until King Boris was alive he tried to limit the persecution against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> , of course, the persecution became extremely cruel in 1940...uh...and it was worse in <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> than in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where in <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> , the Rumanians can be very ferocious when they nurture political hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  At what point then did you...uh...go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">When and how did this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Tell us your story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I think I want to pause and stop a minute please. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We are going to stop for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Are we almost ready or are they still checking. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">5 seconds to stand by. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Getting back to the Jewish question, this was a very situation for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I knew it was very serious then because of the German occupation because extremist Nazi government been...uh...placed because the Germans excentriated the fight against the Jews and so the situation was very critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">For example in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> , where I lived for a year even though I...I traveled while living there, I saw that the beginning of 1942, the Jews completely were disappeared, were wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Uh...Immediately, however, the Jews were free to go to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> with their Christians friends although there were some restrictions there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And so when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I was surprised to see that the Hungarian Jews were free...uh...basically free. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Uh...We had business dealings with them and we could go to <span class="BUILDING">bars restaurants</span> with them, and of course, this 1s not true in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that I had mentioned...uh...where the persecution against Jews was very ugly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  What was it like for you in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> of 1942?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We could eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We could drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We could take walks. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We had a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We could go to the movies a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We danced a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Uh...We could <span class="BUILDING">bars</span> , worked, and everything worked for everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">There were no restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  When did things begin to change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Things suddenly changed on the evening between the 18th and the 19th of March 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Tell us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Uh...That day Admiral Hortee who was a region of the Prime Region of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ...in other words he was head of State, traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to meet with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">However, he was arrested and detained for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">During those days, the Hungarian Democratic government was struck down. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">At the time even though <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was in war, the government was a democratic government. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It had a <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> , a senate, a constitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh...So during Admiral Hortee's imprisonment...uh...they took advantage of this fact to install a Nazi government. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He...the Admiral then returned but the government had...was already in place. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And the first measures that were taken were anti-Jewish laws that were passed and the first...1including the imposing... imposition of wearing the star, the David Star, on the front and on the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  What was life like for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Did life change for you as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Uh...Yes, life did change for me because after the Italian Armistice on September 8th, 1943, I remained loyal to the Queen's government and so therefore I was among those...uh...who were to be arrested, who were supposed to be arrested by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Uh...But that morning I left my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I never returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We're going to have to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You tell him that an entire contract hinges on that man's stopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Now!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Ready now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Just keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Uh...After the Armistice on September 8th, 1943, I had remained loyal to the Italian government, and so I did not adhere to Mussolini's Social Republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So therefore because of this and because I had had some trade disagreements with Germans in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , [...uh...decided to hide when the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ...uh...on that morning, early morning of March 19th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Uh...Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I needed to find a situation...a solution to..uh...my situation and I found one when I asked the Spanish Legation for asylum. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Uh...Because I had fought in the Spanish Civil War, I could take advantage of the fact that the Spanish government had said that anyone who had fought...any foreigner who fought in this war who should ever find himself in difficulties could turn to the Spanish Diplomatic authorities for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And...uh...I ask therefore the Spanish government to give me a passport if...1f I thought that I needed and temporary citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I didn't actually get it right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I didn't go and pick up my passport right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh...in...1n March 1944, and I hid for one week in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish extraterritorial buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Then the Hungarian government notified me that I was to be interned and so I presented myself and I was interned from the beginning of April to October 13th, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">During that time I could not follow the situation closely because I wasn't in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We did hear...uh...about unpleasant...we did hear about unpleasant news. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Uh...We...we could read papers, but there was censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Uh...The internment wasn't bad at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We had three meals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We had tea...uh...with small cakes and cigarettes and soap and toothpaste, even some pocket money. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And all of this was according to the Geneva Convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Uh...And there was treatment afforded to Italian diplomatic members, and I fell within that category.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Why was he then considered an Italian diplomat? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">At that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  And because I was with the Italian Trade Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  When did the internment stop? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">What happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  It didn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Please tell us about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  You want to know how he escaped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Uh...On October 13th, 1943, I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I had these fake papers which authorized me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> for health reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They weren't...it wasn't really true but anyway I had the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Luckily, that morning a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swiss diplomatic car</span> arrived with a Swiss diplomatic and an Hungarian diplomatic who came to visit the internees where we were and check on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And that day I asked them to take me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Of course, they inquired about my documents and they realized they were fake, but they took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> anyway and that was on the 13th. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">On the 15th, Admiral Hortee proclaimed Armistice and....uh...but...uh...he specified in August of 44...1t specified in August 44, Admiral Hortee had fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I must specific...I'm sorry, in August 1944, Admiral Hortee had fired the Nazi government, had eliminated the Nazi government and set up 1n its <span class="NPIP">place</span> a military government which is headed by General Lackatosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Uh...This government first abolished the Star of David, the wearing the Star of David, and struck down the racial laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So for about a month the Jewish community lived in relative peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">For example on October 14th, I lunched with a Jewish Hungarian in a big <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">On the next day on the 15th, I lunched with Mrs. De Franco, who is also Jewish Hungarian married to a Italian diplomatic in a <span class="BUILDING">public restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And during this lunch we heard that Admiral Hortee had proclaimed armistice to the Soviet Union and Anglo-Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Question: He had said he left internment in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Did he mean 1944?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  AA,
QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">After you...what happened to you after this luncheon in October of 44 with Senora DeFranco. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Where did you go and what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Uh...This lady was very fearful when she heard this news which was being repeated on the radio, broadcast over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Anyhow, I...I didn't know what to do and so I decided to seek refuge in my Hungarian friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But after a few days they asked me to leave because they said 1t was dangerous for them...uh...because the Germans and the Hungarians...the Nazi Hungarians had bombarded the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Palace</span> , and Admiral Hortee was taken prisoner and...and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And immediately following these events, the real anti-Jewish terror began. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">At least that's what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And the wearing of the star was imposed once again. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But anyhow, I left my friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went to a <span class="BUILDING">private hospital</span> but even there after a few days the Director asked me to leave for...uh...same reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The next morning, therefore, I decided to ask...to go to the Spanish Legation to ask for the passport that the Spanish government had promised me in September 43 but which I didn't pick up because I didn't want to change nationality at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Uh...So...uh...we went...I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and they had to write up a letter saying they had searched for me a few years and that they finally found me and so that we could proceed with the change of citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So together with a...an attorney from the Spanish Legation, we went to the Hungarian Ministry of Interior where my Italian citizenship was abolished and I became a Spanish citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I was asked to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> within 15 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Naturally, I couldn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Where...where could I go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Please. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">BREAK IN TAPE
ANSWER:  Un...When I returned from the Ministry to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> , there was a lot of confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There were a lot of people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Some of them were wearing the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Some were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">There were about a hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I asked the attorney what was happening and he responded that the Jews were seeking protection, but the Legation had a problem because the only one Christian who could handle all the workload because the...the attorney told me he was also Jewish, and that he was a war hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He had been a war hero during World War I. And so anyway they had this problem because they had...didn't have enough people and they even had at one point 300 people who had been protected and who were taken away and they did not know anything about their whereabouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So at that point I went to the and I told that what I had just learned myself and offered my help. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He replied that...uh...he would be willing and happy to work...to have me work with him, but he couldn't pay me. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I said that I didn't need any money, that I had enough to live on in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So we had one more letter written up to the Ministry...to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> which we took over with...uh...Sanspritz which...uh... was an official statement that I was a member of the Spanish Legation and we had it...a stamp put on it, and I also got my diplomatic identify card...uh... Since Sanspritz therefore was dealing exclusively with the Foreign Affairs Ministry. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That was his responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Myk responsibility was to deal with the Jewish protection organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I had the authorization, official authorization to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">However, I didn't know how to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Uh...And so I asked around and I asked Attorney Farkosh who unfortunately died the first day that the Russians arrived and that this tragedy and a new tragedy started.</span></p>

ANSWER:  At the beginning...uh...my work consisted in trying to find the 300 people who were...who had been protected by the Spaniards and who were arrested...who had been arrested by the Nazis...uh...at the very...the very first few days of the new government. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So a couple of times I went, I traveled to the <span class="DLF">Hungarian German border</span> and eventually we found a few of these people who had better protection from the Spanish Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And we took them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Uh...Then we went to this <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> where goods and merchandise are unloaded on the <span class="DLF">docks</span> ...on the <span class="DLF">platforms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And...uh...these are the <span class="DLF">platforms</span> where the Germans took away thousands of Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And there we found there more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And out of the 300, we found about 150. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We don't know what happened to rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">At the time...uh...that reminds me, I had a small...a little episode happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I saw that there was a column of people who were being deported and...uh...among these people, there were two twins who were very attractive kids and very friendly looking kids who were about 11 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And...uh...so I thought to myself, what would happen to them and...uh...decided to tell them, "Look, kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You see that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> over there with the Spanish flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Run to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the chauffeur will close the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and you'll be safe." </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But at that moment a major of the Gestapo ran to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> because he wanted those kids back. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I told them that the kids were in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">extraterritorial car</span> protected by the Spanish Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So he took out a gun and threatened me. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But next to me was Mr. Wallenberg, who told the German that I was a representative of the Spanish Government and that the kids were in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">extraterritorial car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And...uh...so the German responded, "Leave me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">You're...you're impeding...you're disturbing my work." </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And so I responded, "You call this work?" </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, of course, he got madder and madder and everyone was speaking very loudly at the same time and that includes Wallenberg; that includes a Vatican representative; the Swiss and the Portuguese representatives; all the neutrals. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And at that point a Colonel approached and asked what was happening and he was told and he finally said, "Well, let it be. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Their time will come too", meaning that the two kids would be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So the kids...uh...stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the two Germans left. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And I asked Wallenberg who that man was, and he responded, "That was Eichmann." </span><span class="sentence" id="203">The...uh...two kids didn't have a letter, obviously, of protection....uh...so when we got back to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> ...oh..and...and when we got to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> , I realized they were not two boys as I had thought, but it was a boy and a girl who looked identical but they were of a different sex and so I had to find a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for them but I don't remember the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">At the time if I remember, we only had one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Keep going please. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Please continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  So the...uh...the org...the organization to protect...the Spanish organization to protect...uh...Jews started and this was an initiative...was not an initiative of the Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Uh...The Spanish government was trying...was not an initiative of the Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It was the Spanish Government was trying to save as many Jews as possible and I saw that this was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Uh...and according to Spanish...uh...norms and regulations, they were trying to save as many Jews as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Uh...We had one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the beginning and we slowly built up to six <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But the protection consisted of much more than just writing the letters and of putting up a flag and a banner. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">That was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The...uh...much more attention had to be given to the aftermath and...and to the fact that the Nazis could take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so we had to provide protect...that kind of protection too, not only to our Legation but to the others too, to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ...uh...to the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> and to the Portuguese. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">At the end of November, we had about 3,000 people who were being protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Now on the...other...the last day of November or the first of December, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Now, in a document that I have written previously...memorial that I have written previously, I wrote down the date as being December 7. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I did that to cover Sanspritz. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I did that because I wanted to protect him and he needed 10 days, about 10 days more than necessary so that I could protect him. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But now I have chosen to tell the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">However, I can't give you any more details now, because I first have to speak with the Spanish Ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I will speak with him tomorrow evening because something happened which disturbed me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Something very sad happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And it was sad because it revealed to me that this human soul has...uh...evil elements in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But first before getting into this, I must speak to the Spanish Ambassador for reasons of loyalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Anyway, that day...uh...either the last day of November or the first day of December and I don't remember exactly which one, Sanspritz, who is a diplomat, a career diplomat left. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And so I was trying to decide what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I'd heard by the way that he'd left at about 6:00 AM...uh...through a phone call and I don't remember if it was him...if he personally who called me or someone else, a legal attaché or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But anyway, I learned that he was...that he'd left. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And so I took a walk around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> wondering what I could do and I found myself in <span class="DLF">Lagradi Corroli Street</span> , and I saw that this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was being occupied by the police, so I entered the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and asked what was happening and saw that there were people with suitcases, a few suitcases and...uh...the people, the Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> told me that the police want...wanted to take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So I decided to lock the <span class="DLF">door</span> and...uh...I...1 went to see the lieutenant and I asked him what was happening and I told him that he couldn't do this because the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is being protected...uh...by the Spaniards and he needed my permission, and I was surprised at his behavior since he was part of the regular police forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">He was not a parliamentary police force. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So we came to an agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">The police agreed to postpone everything for a few days and we went to a <span class="DLF">park</span> where we met with these members who belonged to a committee which have representatives from police force, Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and I protested what was happening and someone told me that the...that they had heard that the Spanish representative had fled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so there was no more relations with the Spanish Government. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I told him that he was wrong and that the Spanish had not fled but that he'd went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to talk with his colleagues from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and at the meantime I was his legal substitute and I had documents to prove it. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Uh... demanded that the Hungarians...uh...uh...respect the agreement that...that existed between <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So the foreign affairs representative agreed to postpone everything by 2 or 3 days which gave..uh...new time to go to the Foreign Affairs Ministry to solve the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  Please continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  During this conversation in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , I saw a column of Jews who'd been deported from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> which was right there and...uh...I saw that these were people who were once in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> protected by the Spaniards and I think this was in the...<span class="DLF">Palina Street</span> , but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Uh...So I made them give me these people back. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">There were about 300 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">By the way in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where I'm staying, Mr. Voni came to see me and he was staying in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the...the Gradi No. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">25. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He was 12 at the time and his memory 1s better than mine and he reminded me of some details of that incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">For example, he told me that there was a little 11 year old girl who came to see me when I went to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and asked me, "Please Mr. Save my mother." </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So I said, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Be good and stay put." </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And she came back to me three times with the same request and the last time she came to me and she said, "Look, if you save my mother I'll go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So I slapped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And...uh...then her mother came to me and asked me why I'd slapped her and, of course, I explained to her and perhaps I didn't do the right thing to slap her but anyway that...that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Uh...Then there was another lady who...whose name I don't remember right now and who was in <span class="DLF">park</span> who is living in the same <span class="DLF">street</span> and same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as Eva Lang, that Eva Lang was living on the <span class="INT_SPACE">4th floor</span> , and this other lady...lady was living on the <span class="INT_SPACE">5th floor</span> with her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But, of course, I couldn't know everyone at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I didn't even know Eva Lang....uh...who now is famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">She is a famous artist and journalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But anyway, I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and I found there a representative of...representative of the Swedish Legation, Mr. Danielson and he...uh...had told me that Mr. Sanspritz had given him the responsibility to protect the Spanish...uh..Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I was very much afraid and became very fearful because the relations...diplomatic relations between <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and...uh... <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> were not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So...he also told me that...uh...he was...uh...he took 17,000 Swiss Francs from the Spanish Legation, and that he would send his assistant to check on the situation...uh...regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I became quite fearful, so I called the Swedish Legation, and I said, "Please don't send anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">We don't need your protection because that will make matters worse." </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And he was happy to hear this because...uh..., of course, Swedish relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> were not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And as matter of fact some serious events had occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">The...uh...the Swedish...I'm sorry...the Spanish...uh...diplomatic legation had an influence on <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and we didn't understand it at the time why we had this favorable treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We under...only understood it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Uh...But anyhow, the...uh...there was no more question of being protected by the Swedes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Can you give me the jest of it and then we'll go on and do the translation later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Uh...The same day I started in my regular activities which included...included the continuous granting of letters of protection, which included finding <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because six were now eventually built up to eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And...uh...this work intensified and I established relations with the various police forces, with the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I was looking for support, and it didn't matter where it came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">The important thing was that I got support...uh...because letters were not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">These <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> needed to be...needed to be protected 24 hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Uh...If you talk to , she will tell you many more details. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">She was a young girl at the time and she lived through this tragedy with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But anyway, I was seeking contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It didn't matter where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">The important thing was that...that they were useful contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry to clarify the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I said...clarify...uh...and I said...I told them what I...what I had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">When I...when I use the clarify...when I knew this I said what I had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And...uh...the permanent, the foreign affairs permanent secretary just...uh...believed what I said and...uh...and I began to...I began to understand why <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> had so much respect for the Spanish Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I only began to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It wasn't perfectly clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And this was because...uh...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> , the Hungarian...uh...Legation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> had remained faithful, loyal to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hortee</span> after October 15th. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And, of course, all Hungarians still looked to Hortee. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And the Nazi government didn't have a representative in the Spanish government and they wanted one, and I understood that they wanted one. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Uh...Anyway, we came to an agreement and...uh...I get... got the sensation that I was being...uh...that I was in a stronger position...uh...and I even saw the Foreign Affairs Minister for a few minutes...uh...Mr. Kennenee. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And having understood this, we worked better. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And it was lucky because...uh...I don't know if Sanspitz either forgot or left on purpose a...his signature pad. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Uh...And which I used. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The agreement were that no letters could be dated after November 8th, so I just dated all the letters before November 8th, and I used his signature although I signed about 50 myself after December and I also signed two or three passports which...which, of course, were false and had no legal bearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Uh...Anyway, the weeks passed by and...uh...I understood that they wanted to send a representative to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> to...uh...forge peace treaty, to sign a treaty...uh...and they realized their mistake and...uh...uh...eliminating Hortee, so...uh...the other legations were...didn't count. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The Swedish Legation had been destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> didn't count and...uh...had Swedish protection, but it didn't count and the Portuguese counted very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> , but...uh...Fununchio was tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He was old and he was sick and although he was in good faith, the Swiss were like fish in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">You never knew what they were going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And...anyway, no one counted really, because they were all against Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Uh...There was the International Red Cross that was headed by Mr. Weirman, who...uh...who I will talk about later...uh...diplomatic representatives need courage in tragic moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I don't know if I had courage and I really wasn't think about it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I wasn't thinking about the dangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But I will say this. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">That the representative of the International Red Cross who had ambassadorial rank...uh...was a..uh...wicked man. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Uh...I've...even if I've written differently at other times, now I can say that he is a wicked man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Ask him please why the representative from the Red Cross was a wicked man. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Please explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  I say that because he didn't have any courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Uh...Perhaps I didn't have any courage either, but he locked himself in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ...uh...and didn't come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I...to proceed with this story, I met with a...a German General who was the military representative in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to protest...uh...the fact that...uh...Jews were being taken from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> to the common <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So I went to...uh...see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I would go to anyone who I thought could help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And...uh...I said that I was disturbed by these movements because the enemy might think that actually they were troops that were being moved so...uh...I was fearful of that so I asked him if the Red Cross, International Red Cross, the Swedes...the Swiss had any...uh...contacts with the Soviet Union for...or could have any contacts with the Soviet Union for an honorable surrender of the <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And the German replied that he had his orders, and he couldn't do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So I went to see Weirman, and I told him what the German General had said and that if he sought contacts with the Soviet Union, then an honorable surrender might be possible in order to avoid further fighting and deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he told me that he just would not do it, and he could not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Uh...And I knew that he was living in this <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> all the time...and reinforced basement, was reinforced so that he could be protected from bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And that's why I say that he was wicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Uh...By the way, that reminds me that I have...I bought condensed milk for the kids on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> with the Red Cross symbol.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I just want to clarify what I meant about Weirman. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Uh...I said that he was wicked and but not everyone was like me who could...uh...they haphazardly and casually just get involved in...in the situations like I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">What I'm trying to say is that I think he was wicked because I would have done differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Probably in his situation and his physical mental state of mind he had his reasons for doing that, but I would have done differently.</span></p>

of state and government. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I was surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I was having lunch with an Italian lady who was of the Jewish faith and she was married to an Italian diplomat and we...she was speechless and I was surprised, and I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So I I hid because the TV was controlled by the Admiral government and everything else fell in the hands of the Nazis and of the Germans, Hungarian Nazis and the German army and their...and then I went to hide in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which belonged to a friend of mine, uh family friends in the and from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I went to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to hide because I didn't know where to go because from the first evening I slept in a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in who gave me the keys to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">The next day I discovered that the maid was a German, a , and she was pro-Nazi and therefore I didn't go back to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it seemed dangerous to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">After a couple of days in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I spent two more days in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I was hidden by the <span class="REGION">land</span> ...by the landlady in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I used to live once upon a time, but then I realized that the Ugandian (ph) Hotel that I knew very well was being emptied because many German officers were leaving with their suitcases and I went to the keeper of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I asked him if he could give me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he said give me a passport and I said I don't have any passport anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I don't have any more documents and he said OK, for two days I'll give you a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and then I...so I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And so therefore the next morning I decided to go to the Spanish Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">It was probably eight in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I went there and on the way, on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and I was on foot,on _ <span class="DLF">Street</span> which 1s a big <span class="DLF">street</span> , I saw that some Hungarian Nazis were chasing a child who was probably seven or eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They reached him and one of them shot the child in the back of the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I was quite struck by this naturally and I asked a passerby why, what did that child do? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Who is he? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And he said he's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">From the roofs of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , however, there were some Jews who were shooting against the Nazis from the <span class="BUILDING">rooftop houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But anyway I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> andI found __ who gave me a passport and I...he said come tomorrow with two photos, and I had two in my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then he gave me the passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And he also gave me a letter from the Minister of Interior which said that the Spanish government two years earlier had granted me their citizenship because I had fought in the civil war and also, the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the letter said that they were not able to locate me and that they now found me and I had to assume citizenship, Spanish citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE So we were...with this letter I went together with the legal attaché...we went to the Minister of Interior where I changed citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I canceled the Italian one and I assumed Spanish citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">When I returned to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> that early morning, it was probably eight or nine a.m., and it's strange that that morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m., but these were very difficult times and people didn't always go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I saw...thank you...that there was a lot of confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and that many of these people who were there had were wearing the David Star, Star of David, and I asked the legal attaché what was happening and he said that these were people who are asking for our protection, protection from the Spanish government but right now we're in difficulty because the only Christian legation 1s Sanspritz. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And therefore it's impossible to organize an external protection and it's it doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be of help, then [...maybe I can do something, so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> and I told him I'm available if you need me, and he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have any funds to pay you with and I said I'm not interested because I have enough money to survive on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And so I started immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I started working immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The first few hours I must tell the truth....I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where to start, but then after speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who was the attorney and also with the Chancellor and with other people who were there who were all Jews, Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of the refugees and so I realized what could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">The first thing was to try to get back about three hundred people who had been protected by <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They had about three hundred, only three hundred at that time because the Hungarian government had said three hundred, and Sanspritz accepted this decision on behalf of the Spanish government and this is something that I didn't, didn't accept immediately at first so those first two or three days my job was to try to find those who had been protected, of the three hundred protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Of the three hundred I was able to get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at the uh <span class="BUILDING">Merchandise Depot</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and also by going to the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and say <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and those who had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It seems to me we had rented two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> but I don't remember now how many, or we brought them back with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or we reserved a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ...I, I don't really remember how that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I was with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So I started working. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if you're going to edit it, edit this tape... ..So the episode at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> ...you can take it from the other tape and put it together, piece it together. (</span><span class="sentence" id="402">Pause- Technical Conversation) The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were, at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> they were loading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train cars</span> with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true, that they were going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They were people who were being deported and then we didn't know what would happen to them in the end, so much so that Eva Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but on the trip between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and the <span class="DLF">border</span> he understood...I don't know how...but he understood that it was a trick and so he jumped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">| don't think that that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> existed yet but anyway he came to one of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish houses</span> , so...this episode of the two twins...at a certain point there was a column which was going and we were looking to see if anybody was there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins, two kids of eleven or twelve years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">They were very handsome kids, nice kids and they were identical and the more I saw the more I told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Run to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Close the <span class="DLF">door</span> and then the chauffeur will know what he has to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Maybe you would like to hear from me how I could communicate with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">At the time I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">One Gestapo major came to and he wanted the kids back, and I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">They were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Spanish car</span> and it had a Spanish uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license plates and therefore the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was extra-territorial property. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">He insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He took out his gun and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to me and Wallenberg said...told the major, the German major, look...this man represents <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">You can't...you can't commit any violent acts. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He said look. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">He's getting in the way of my work, and instinctively I replied that you call this work. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">That's what I asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And so he got even more angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He wanted the kids back. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And I...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I thought my God, this man 1s crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">He could shoot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He had a big gun, a Mauthauser (ph), a big big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I was screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Wallenberg, the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> ...everyone intervened in the discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and he asked the major what was happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come too for the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And so they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And then I brought these kids <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I brought them to the Legation and I was surprised to see that they were really a boy and a girl who when they were fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The same height, the same face...everything, everything was identical. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">This is an episode that struck me which, which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , these two episodes made me reflect very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully aware of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">From the end of March to October 13th, I was not...I had been interned away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> ...I continued my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I stopped looking for the three hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have understood that there was nothing more that could be done and so I started to organize the protection network. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I don't remember where it was. (</span><span class="sentence" id="442">Technical conversation) I don't remember which one it was but we did have one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Maybe two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> we had already. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Maybe they were ___ wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but anyway that's not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I started organizing by issuing hundreds of letters immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">We would go to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and type up these letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Sanspritz didn't know anything because we used his signature pad. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">He didn't know how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">His job was to keep relations with the Foreign Affairs Minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So we issued I think more than two thousand five hundred protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October and November. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">To be more specific...I couldn't be more specific than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I think we maybe reached three thousand, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It wasn't very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue a letter of protection and to escort these people to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they had to be escorted to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> uh as the letters of protection were issued. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> who were available and who shuttled back and forth between the Legation and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where they were going to live and they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had to uh provide for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We had to get them settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Normally these <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> that we would take, we had to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and perhaps we didn't even pay the rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they did do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They did especially they would try to attack those <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Swiss houses</span> because they had a a system of protection which was not correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">In other words, they had given, both of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had a mixed committee, Jewish and Christian committee which was responsible for issuing letters of protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">To sum it up these letters were being sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so therefore every day they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I think that as far as I know <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> issued forty million letters of protection and in its <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> it had maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the next day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They weren't rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I saw them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">That's not correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">These letters are being sold and everyone knows about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The authorities know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Anyway, we had to protect to prevent that these people be taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We had to protect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">With one excuse or the other the Nazi police...not the regular police...the regular police would intervene when they had orders but there was also various police forces, Nazi police forces in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> of representing various factions which were ferocious. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the those who were being protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked common sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Sometimes it was useless. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because if you go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they'll take, they take you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They put you in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They would go and take a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Or for whatever reasons, their own reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I even created the committees in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with three members and their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, and to prevent people from leaving the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and going on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">They had to remain <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because there they were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">If they left the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , they were no longer safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They would take their stars off and they would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and there would be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers and what papers could they show. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They didn't have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">If they did, it would be clear that they were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And so we had to find uh food for them and security besides watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We were pretty lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It was a continuous job because we had to travel throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> continuously to show the flag, to show that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I went daringly on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and little by little with the with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ...1 would go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and so the people could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was guarding them, and therefore and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We tried with a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> too but it was but it failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">The...1t was my idea but it was a bad idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">It didn't go well. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So weeks went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Quite the contrary. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I made as many contacts as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I...one day for example I took ...1 don't know what that is...I took twenty-five thousand __ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpetia</span> and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very thankful and every time, every time I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where he...I went up to see him to say hello to him and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the time, how it was going at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">For example, since Fritz didn't want to go to the Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never left the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> to visit a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...he never visited any of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He wasn't interested even in how many signatures were used with his signature pad because he was a diplomat and he had uh limited vision. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He was an old-timer diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">This 1s a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideological as it had become, when there was no persecution of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Not only of Jews but also the uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> there were many uh...uh they had orchestras. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They played the violins and they had <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and they played the orchestras and with the violins and their famous people...in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> (ph)... . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I'm sorry...I can't find the word...you know...these traveling homeless kind of people...oh...uh... they, they dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...gypsies, gypsies....thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I couldn't find the word...sorry...OK. (</span><span class="sentence" id="512">Pause) In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> on...day and night I went to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and I had meals and in the evenings they had orchestras. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They were played by the gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And there was a beautiful restaurantin —_—<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">siin Square</span> , where there was a good orchestra and there were a couple of good violinists. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">One day they disappeared, in January of '42 I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">January of 1942 they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I asked the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , what happened to the orchestra, the band. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And he said well...at first he didn't really want to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He was reticent, and then he said the Germans took them off, because they are of an inferior race. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So they persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were many of them, and the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Not only uh Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and this is something that I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">This is not something that I just heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So, so we...this is how we worked, issuing these letters of protection and then Sanspritz left. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I don't remember if he left the 30th of November or December Ist. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Uh it seems...I think that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me November 30th. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He told me November 30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and that morning there was a reaction on behalf of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I found myself that morning, early in the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but they called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspritz had left and so I got up and II visited the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> thinking what do I do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="531">What is the situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And in a certain sense the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Street, Number 25, where the child was in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...he reminded me of some details the other day when I saw him for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">He recalled some details that I didn't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I saw besides...speaking of he exaggerates when I say that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">He exaggerates. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">As a child, he thought that that's what I did but it wasn't quite like that, but anyhow that's how he saw itt. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">That's his mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">More or less that's how it was, but I wasn't screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I wasn't yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So I saw...I entered this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I said, what is happening here. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They were...they told us oh they want to take us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The police want to deport us. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And sure enough the regular police was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Not the Nazis, the regular police was there which was commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieutenant, what do you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I've got to take everyone away. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And I closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I locked it, and I said look, no one is leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The Spanish flag is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The Spanish emblem is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">This...we consider this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> extra-territorial property. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It wasn't legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It wasn't right, but what governs such governments, you could just say...you could make up things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It couldn't have been an extra-territorial house. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">You needed special permission from the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">The government had not given any special permission to do that, and so we discussed and we reached an agreement that he would postpone the...and together we would go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> , in the center of the <span class="DLF">park</span> , where there was a committee composed of various police forces, the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Interior Minister and I don't know who else...seven or eight people. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And I went there to speak with these people and I spoke with energy and with boldness because if I went there with my hat in hand and I said hey, they would say hey, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">You had to assert yourself, especially with the Hungarians because these people are, are tough people and you had to be just as tough, and he said...I asked him what's happening, why do you want to take these uh people away. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He said because Sanspritz fled. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Who said that he fled? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Sanspritz took a trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> where he is going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German and Swiss diplomats to discuss the situation, but then he is coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But in the meantime I am his...the legal representative of the Spanish government and charge d'affaires and I showed him my passport and my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign Affairs Minister representative said yes, this man is uh right what he said, so that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The only thing is that uh Sanspritz really did leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">He did flee, and he didn't have any intentions of coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So much so that he didn't even tell me that he was leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He didn't tell me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Nothing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">He left. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And I learned about it when he was already at the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He left at four or five in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Anyway, but that's not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Perhaps it was a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">It was a good thing, because the Nazis uh had invaded that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it gave me the opportunity to present myself as the successor to the man who they thought had escaped, so the representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">You're right. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">The situation is legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Uh and I said look, there's a flag at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">There's a flag at all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> too, and he said...we had an agreement that after two or three days I would go to the Foreign Affairs Minister Ministry to clarify the Spanish position and in fact this is what happened, but when I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> , I found that the Swedish Danielson (ph) Minister who was Wallenberg's boss had been to the Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Danielson wanted to get some money...some Swiss francs. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They're about seventeen thousand Swiss francs which were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I protested at...thisis __ who is the Chancellor, and I said what do we do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We still had some _, Some money left and not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">She didn't know what to do and she said that he said that he would send a secretary every morning, a Swedish secretary to see that everything was uh alright, and I said no, please, don't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I called Minister Danielson. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I begged him not to send anyone and that and that I would go and see him later on to explain the situation and I'm I went probably the next day or so, because if <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> uh protected the interest of the Spanish Legation, that meant that the interest of the Spanish Legation would no longer exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So we continued to work. . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The situation in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> came back to normal and while I was there in the <span class="DLF">park</span> I saw that there was a column of Jews that were being deported and I saw that someone was waving and so I went to see and I saw that these were some of the people protected from another <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , the <span class="DLF">Street</span> , of Number 33 which was very close, and so I made them give me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The situation in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was probably, was pretty normal and peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I don't know what those questions refer to. (</span><span class="sentence" id="588">He hasn't understood the question.) </span><span class="sentence" id="589">There were...you mean...are you referring to the quantity of people who were there, the sleeping conditions, the eating conditions...what are you referring to? . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">In during December, the first ten days of December, we took some other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ...the last two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , it seems to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">But the...from a point of view of the living conditions it was a very difficult situation and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there were five hundred people. _ </span><span class="sentence" id="592">told me that they slept on the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I don't remember exactly even though there was a committee that held the list of all the people who arrived every day, but I don't remember how many there were exactly, because...I must step forward here. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">The morning that the Russians arrived, I burnt everything, even the lists of those who were protected because you never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the GPU...you don't know how they could have interpreted this fact, so we destroyed everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">The Chancellor didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She wanted to save a few things, and I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Everything will be destroyed because nothing shall be left in the hands of the Russians because the Russians, the same day entered the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> as I expected, had predicted. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then they uh then they burnt it...they damaged it but I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The situation was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">As far as living conditions it was also difficult for the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">It was difficult for the hygienic conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">It was difficult to find medicines. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">There was a difficult time, for example, because they had tried to close the water supply in some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested with vigor. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I went to the police commander and I demanded that the water be returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">These things cannot be done because if there is a protection, then these people must have the necessary elements to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">If there is no water, I don't know what would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">With five hundred people and and 1f it were sixty or seventy...I don't know how, what would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And then there was the problem of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We had to feed these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">At a certain point there was no more money left from the Legation...this was Hungarian money in the Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I spent some of my money that I had in my pockets but I didn't have that much and you had to buy on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , and so I went to the Jewish Council, , and they gave me some money and then they didn't have any left either. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They, they were just in terrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They had nothing left to eat themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I must uh say that in the month of August, had fired the Nazi government and one of the first measures that was taken was that the star be no longer worn and all the racial laws were being dismantled and brought down, and so many people went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where they had lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Not everyone lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Some of them lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpetia</span> (ph) for example, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchovina</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="620">They were farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">The, the Jewish, the Jews of that <span class="REGION">area</span> were farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">They forced uh these Jews from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and...those who had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ...and they concentrated them in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which could support maybe two, three million people...not fifty or sixty...two or three thousand people, not fifty or sixty thousand people, and so there was this black, terrible hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">There was...there were infections. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">There were diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">They was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">There was no electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">There, there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">They had nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And so this uh Jewish Council also ran out of money and once it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with what I had I could buy something from the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and specifically I had to be careful with...watch the children because we had two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> which were really not ours but one belonged to the International Red Cross I think and one belonged to the Swedish Red Cross and the Spanish Legation had been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and here I must open a parenthesis because the truth is the truth after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">On the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> I bought condensed milk with the symbol of the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And we had uh...it was very expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We had to pay for it dearly on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , but there were many children. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">There were children in the two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> and there were children in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , the protected <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And since the Jewish Council which whose name was ; , which means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn't have any money left, wasn't giving any money any more, since I had nominated a committee for each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to maintain the discipline and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I charged these committees to spy uh financially, economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">They said...they would tell me which people could give money. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And so I went to these people...not every day...and I said give me athousand _. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">You can give me five thousand, near five...according to their capabilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And these people gave me money. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But somebody would say, why. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Why should I give you money? </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And I would say because you have the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We need the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I don't have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The Legation doesn't have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">What...what will we use to buy food with. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee undertook that there were some families that had reserves of food that were bountiful and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> anymore, and so I had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these families had. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And this food was distributed because I don't know what would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">There would have been fights because hunger is hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing and she's right, don't you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And so therefore with these stories...uh these stories occurred day after day, week after week, and we finally come to the day of Christmas Eve, which was a terrible day...because the Russians, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> considered themselves in a state of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Anyhow, I always kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Yes...yes... it's started. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Uh Christmas Day I remember that I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">On Christmas Eve, on Christmas Eve I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I spent uh...that evening and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It was in late afternoon and I thought that I would eat there but when I arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> I found that there were elements of the Hungarian army with machine guns and other arms and so forth, and they told me that it's not possible to pass through because the Russians are very close, three hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told them that I have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I'm, I'm a diplomat and I have to go to the, all the people of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Legation</span> , which was very close, a hundred meters from here, and they said OK, we'll give you fifteen minutes and then you have to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Otherwise it's uh your business. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So I went and I found that everything was topsy-turvy. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We had sixty refugees 1n the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and, and I understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">They, they had made a big Christmas tree for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It was big because they had...they cut it down from the <span class="DLF">park</span> and it was six or seven meters high and you would enter the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and you would go down to the second...the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and it was all...1t was a Christmas tree that was, that took up two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and was full of presents and I looked at the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I am letting them know that the Russians are here, that there's going to be some fighting here and that we don't know what the Germans would have done and so forth and so I just said goodbye to everyone and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I was...didn't go back to the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> because the next day it was burnt by a German grenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">That evening, which was Christmas Eve, which is a holiday in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> too...it's...there's a big supper on Christmas Eve and I had been invited to lunch at the <span class="BUILDING">__ Hotel</span> by the Secretary of the Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I feared that with this invitation he wanted to ask me to pay for the Spanish passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I gave the Spanish passports to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">That's now true. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">If they had asked it from me, I don't know what I would have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I would have judged...assessed the situation at the time and I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practically I would have sold the passports in exchange for guarantees for security for the protected people. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So we lunched together and we spoke about everything except politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We joked around, and at a certain point we had finished our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, gave the minister something...just like in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I think that this...on this piece of paper there was written that he had to leave and in fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but I have to leave and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And I was happy because he didn't ask me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which was a delicate question to hand over a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Yes, I did have passports to give, but if if the question became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">He's not authorized to give out passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Even though there are Hungarian newspapers that say that I gave uh passports to Nazi ministers, that's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">In fact, during the trials they didn't bring this up, so I was alone because I didn't even want an escort that evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I said I was going to go to dinner that evening and he would...and I just need someone to take me to some...to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> or to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that's all, because I had many <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I could go and sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">At a certain point, I was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazis, who asked me to see my passport and they said that this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer valid. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And during this conversation I saw on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> a uh army elements, a pa...army patrol, and so I called them and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> came and it was commanded by a lieutenant who commanded thirty men or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me and this is my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">You can't touch this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He's a diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">He represents <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and so he sent them away, and so they escorted me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And I decided that I would go spend the night in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in uh , in <span class="DLF">Street, Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I invited this lieutenant to come and have a drink with me and he told me, declared to me that they were about to close...they were about to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and there was only one <span class="DLF">street</span> open left, and that's why I understood that the minister who had been in such a hurry to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And so the next morning I tried to get in touch with the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> , because I had left two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there and I needed those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">One belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> and another had been lent to me that morning by an Italian citizen because the only two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that I had in the Legation were not working, and so he lent me this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the next day the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was burnt in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">The whole <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Nothing was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Of my stuff, one girl saved five handkerchiefs that she had wanted to save me, but she didn't want to hang them on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">She didn't want to hang the handkerchiefs on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> with everything else and this girl came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the last minute before the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> burnt and she uh got the box with the handkerchiefs and after three months, she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to give me the handkerchiefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">That morning...that Christmas morning was a terrible morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="698"><span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> ...I don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the Slovak minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="699"><span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> had been annexed by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was independent and so they had a diplomatic representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">This diplomatic representative who had contacts with the Spaniards...I don't know how...I don't remember...but anyhow with, together with the attorney Fakash went to look for him to bring him to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We found him. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He was dead, in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> before the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">The Nazis had killed him because they had discovered that he was anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">When I returned they wanted to take attorney Fakash away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They wanted him to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and if he left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I was able to bring him back to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and I told him you're not to leave this <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I will go alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I will be escorted by the police forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I will go alone and you remain here because your life is in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So I...the days...that's how the days passed after Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">By New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We even danced...sure...we danced in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We even brought out some bottles of Spanish wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">There were hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious Spanish wine from , bottles of wine from these areas in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> which is precious wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I liked it anyhow and I used to drink it all the time in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And they danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">They even danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I was happy because these people who were in hiding...and they were all Jews except for one who said he was a priest, but I don't think he was a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I think that he was a priest who was pretending...uh a Jew who was pretending to be a priest I think, but I never saw him again these are not details that really interested me since they did not come into the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They came only for...in the last moment when we were asleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> together and that's when we had this party and that's when I saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I, I always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't have any contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">You know, we'd just say hello and good evening and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">There was a Hungarian diplomat, , who had a wife and daughter...uh many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">There was sixty or so people, and they even danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And then the situation began to get worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So we still continued to issue those letters of protection because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was I...where was I...OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> and take them to the old grand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and deport them. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I didn't believe in such a thing because they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph) capital, they were saying that he was going to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and kill all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">This would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door or the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above...you know how it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing <span class="DLF">Mussolini Square</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">That night, during that during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the Portuguese Legation and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...1f he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands II didn't...I couldn't assume any more responsibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I'd had enough of my own, and so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">He was the , was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Probably the 8th. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Perhaps even in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Anyway, it's not that important. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So he went there that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I went because I had heard these rumors which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">city hall Budapest</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and who was Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And I told them I'm going to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> first because I have an appointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">My appointment...it hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and when I return from the appointment then we can all talk together. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">The colonel uh who is head of the gendarmerie, accompanied me to the <span class="BUILDING">minister's office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">It was a little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and this colonel three days later killed himself by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">He saw that everything was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Sada (ph) was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole gendarmerie of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And so I started to say do you realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you know...I even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind, _____ people...anything to move him. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I even cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I, I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...1f within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received guarantees. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic representative to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">It was for a certain Colonel . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">The Spanish government never answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">The Spanish ambassador told me that last night. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I understood naturally, slowly... slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to contact the Anglo-Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We understood it late, but we understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not everyone is intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I wasn't intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> will be interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So this minister said a friendly government like the Spanish government would do such a thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="773">What friendly government? </span><span class="sentence" id="774">If you are against us, you're the ones who are against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">This is what we want. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">We want to protect these Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against our policy and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We're friends if you say, if you do what we want. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">To sum it up he said, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">The Spaniards are, are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I became uh demanding in that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">All...everyone or nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">All of those in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> must remain where they are or all those in the common <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> must be, must have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what would what would happen of the Hungarian people, so I repeated to him again and all the stories about vendettas, terrible vendettas and uh the Anglo-Americans uh who would come to bombard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And so we agreed that everything would have uh occurred in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">When I left the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I found Wallenberg and were still there, and I explained the situation to them and I said I was able to obtain this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">When you do <span class="NPIP">inside</span> I don't know what you can ask of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this agreement that we've just come to. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Otherwise nothing more...so Wallenberg asked me for political asylum in the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wait for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">You go to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I'll wait for you and I'm going to have to go find something in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and then I'll I'll meet you there at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">He said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I will come with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I'll give you the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> because I know you need a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and I'll come. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he wason | <span class="DLF">Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I know this for sure, and he had left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at ten in the morning to go I don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">From then on he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Now since the since historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I say that's not true because on the morning of the 18th he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in the on the _<span class="DLF">_ Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">means king. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I don't know really...I saw him maybe a dozen times. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I spoke to him specifically during the meetings with diplomats. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I never saw him otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">From the beginning of December, all the diplomats, mutual diplomats, had disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">He couldn't find any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Wallenberg... when I saw Wallenberg at <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> on the meeting, the day that I met , uh I'd seen him, besides that time, I'd seen him on December 22nd at the uh Papal Nuncio (ph) where he had signed a document uh to protest uh and this was in favor of women and I remember that he did not sign that document because he couldn't sign it because he was a secretary and Minister Danielson, his boss, was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">The ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">His, his boss wasn't there at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Uh that morning during the meeting I told the Archbishop Angelo I would like to speak privately with you and so we went into another <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and so I told him look...I started speaking to him in Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">In the meetings we always spoke in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Uh I started speaking in Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I said look, I'm not a Spaniard. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I'm Italian and I'm close to you because I'm, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Komo</span> (ph) and he had also been born close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Komo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">He said oh, you're...you're kidding. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You're joking. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I said no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I'm not kidding. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">This is the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I tell you this because if something would ever happen to me, you...I want you to know this so that you can uh tell my relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">He told me, I remember, don't tell . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">was his secretary because that guy is very picky. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">He can...he might become very angry, might cause trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I said no no. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I won't tell . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And this...practically this is where the story ends because after a few days...no, actually the next morning, Mr. __, Mr. ____ sent an employee to ask for telegrams to send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> because we didn't have a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> was under siege and it wasn't...we couldn't communicate with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Normally you could telephone <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> telephoned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> via radio communicated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">But this...it was no longer possible to use the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And so I sent this employee to ask for a telegram which uh I asked him to send via radio radio because he had a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who was an attorney who was very picky, an old-timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the telegram and I told him look, if I don't send the telegram as soon as this employee goes back to Minister ; everything will fall apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">If we send the telegram we'll save four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">We'll gain four or five days because the Spanish government will of course have to reflect on this before responding. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">They're not going to respond immediately obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">The telegram will be send today. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I don't know if it'll arrive immediately in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> and who will receive it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">It has to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> and this takes time. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I wrote to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">After two or three or four days the...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> sent its response thanking uh thanks and it said that it was sure that the Hungarian government would have respected the agreements and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">The employee came to deliver the telegram himself and he said that the minister was very satisfied with the telegram and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And then one time something happened which is a little bit funny but at the same time it uh it's...[ don't want to say fear but it gave me, made me a little bit anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">This was at the end of December. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I think before Christmas I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry and I entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">antechamber</span> where the secre...permanent secretary had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">He was like a Vice Minister with whom I'd had contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">His name was , and I saw that there were two men seated on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> who were waiting and one of them I I recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">He was the Chancellor of the Italian Legation, the Royal Italian Legation, and the other gentleman I didn't know who he was, so I very boldly...I had to very boldly salute them like this and instead of going to the secretary who sort of looked at me with surprise, I went to to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I pretended to knock. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and to see this Vice Minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I did what I had to do and after four...after fifteen minutes or so I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I said goodbye to the young lady and I made aa vague signal with my hand like this and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">But once I arrived in the in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> I really came back and I started to eaves...eavesdrop and I heard that these two people entered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and entered the Vice Minister's office so I entered the <span class="REGION">area</span> too, and I asked Mrs...the young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize these two men and she said the big man is Minister Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republic of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and the other is his secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">He was the he was a fascist minister, the Social Republic...the Fascist Social Republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">On the 1 6th...1n the meantime between the...on the 13th it wasn't possible to leave the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We still had telephone communications with which I could control or check on the various <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , not directly because there were no phones in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> but there were Christians who lived uh in front of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or next to them, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and they had agreed to telephone to us if there was danger and for example with Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 4th or 5th or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I think she told me even...I think she even told me...anyway they, they remember more than I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">She called me and I went over there at three in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Anyhow, ; . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">There wasn't...no...1t wasn't just that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">That happened many times, ten or fifteen times. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Almost every evening I had to get up and go because the Nazis wanted to come and take them away, to take the Jews away from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . ... </span><span class="sentence" id="862">speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I told them that we had agreements with the Hungarian government and so forth and so on and in the meantime somebody well from my entourage...I always had an entourage. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I always had four police officers and two employees of the <span class="BUILDING">security office</span> and in reality I always traveled with two people but...two policemen and two public security people, and they never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two policemen who left and the Legation too...I...I felt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag and the banner whenever I traveled with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">But anyway this normally happened at night and I would go on foot because it was dangerous to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">There weren't very many lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But anyhow that night, that last night that I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...I didn't know Eva Long at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I met her only three years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I...I arrived five minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> from the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> and you asked me how I, how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell them that we had agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">This is someone who had helped me, because I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis, non-Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">It doesn't matter that he was a Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so I had contacts with him and there was a Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">If I asked him for something, he would do it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">You understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Now I had contacts with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I had contacts with everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Whoever happened to be there, I had contacts with because that's how you had to operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Experience taught me that everyone can be useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">There's some who do big favors and some who do smaller favors. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Some could intervene for this and some could intervene for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">The Foreign Affairs Minister could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for this and the Nazi Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the Legation was...at the very end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> ...the <span class="DLF">street</span> was three hundred meters long, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tank</span> with the mouth of the cannon facing the <span class="DLF">street</span> which would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dared to leave and go on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">In order to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the Legation to the —_—_—« Paraguayan Legation which was...you had to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and dash, make a dash to get to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And as soon as you did the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in telephone contact with the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because as I said there were always Christian friends who had telephones in nearing the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> who were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">They saw something abnormal. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">For example, that night they called...I don't know who they called. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">After half an hour I arrived and I saw that they were about to take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I stopped everything but unfortunately I arrived five minutes after a man threw himself out of a <span class="DLF">window</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I thought it was a woman, but Eva Long told me that it was a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">When I arrived they had already covered the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">The police had covered the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And I thought it was a woman but in...1t was a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And so on the 16th uh you arrived in my <span class="REGION">area</span> , on my <span class="DLF">street</span> and until the afternoon, in the afternoon, up until the afternoon they had respected extra-territory . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">We took the flag down. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">We put the Swedish flag up. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">We took the emblem, the Spanish emblem down and put the Swedish emblem because <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was supposed to protect <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> 's interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">No...because that's the way it's done. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">When one nation cannot have relations with another nation, another nation which can have relations, it can intervene to protect the interests and in fact I think that <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was able to...after ten or twelve days of the Russian's arrival, to...was able to empty the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Of that I'm not really sure because I was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I couldn't do anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">As I was telling you about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> , on the morning of the 18th, the Russians took me and they put me to sweep the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900"><span class="DLF">Street</span> ...I had to sweep <span class="DLF">Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">At a certain point I saw in front of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> a man whose name was who, who, had been my chauffeur and who had been wounded driving my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I wasn't there at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Uh my...in my position where I was seated uh there was a policeman who was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">He...and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was taken away and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was found again a few hours later but it was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">This man has been my chauffeur to do me a favor and at the same time had, he had also, he had had ties with the International Red Cross because the delegate of the International Red Cross never showed his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">The human miseries. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So I asked him, did you see Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">He's here. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Please, go, go fetch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I can't move because there's this guy here with a machine gun, the GBU guy who, who is forcing me to sweep the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">After fifteen minutes or ten minutes though he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">He say no, he's gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">He left a few minutes ago, and this is about eleven in the morning, but from then on nothing more was heard about Wallenberg, so I, therefore I think that he died or because he was hit by a sniper or because he was hit by a German grenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Uh they resisted until the mid-February in the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> (ph), in the hills of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , I think, or perhaps he met a group of Nazis, Hungarian Nazis, who recognized him and who killed him on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">There were hundreds and hundreds of bodies buried in the snow in the area of the Spanish Legation, <span class="DLF">Mussolini Square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I think that he wanted to cross <span class="DLF">Street</span> to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Or anyhow such...this...a similar declaration was...I made a similar declaration in 1962 I think after a request that was made to me by the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Last year Danielson's widow invited me to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trento</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I was at and when we talked about this issue, she told me that her husband and the Foreign Affairs Minister never believed that Wallenberg was taken to the Soviet Union, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Anyhow, some people were interested in blowing up the issue in good faith but then others kept saying things that were not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">As far as I was concerned that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I may be wrong but that's how it was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">That's what I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I remained three or four months until April, May...ftve months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and then the Russians uh kicked every...all the foreign citizens out. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I was trying to get back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but they could have sent us Italians <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and in ten or twelve hours we would have been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capezio</span> (ph) or to or to the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , what's it called... . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Instead they sent us via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucha</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> and it took ten days of travel in latched up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and with a hunger that I don't want to speak about because we didn't even have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">There was nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I had only... everything...I had only what I was wearing the day that the Russians arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Everything had been burnt at the Legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">No...yes...at the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Legation</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , and everything else was stolen by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I didn't even have a shaver to shave. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">In those days they had...I had a Gillette shaver. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Uh we...when we arrived...when I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , I found the...someone who had the suitcase that once...a suitcase that once had belonged to me and which had also my shaving kit and I said to him I need my shaving kit. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Luckily this person had an extra shaving kit. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #4 Tape #5 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION When I returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> I found that my company had fired me and, and it was an ugly period and I had to even pay for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that I had borrowed from an Italian and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was then burnt and I had to pay for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with my money, but anyway it was a bad period, but anyway I managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">It's difficult when you're forty to change jobs and in a bad situation as it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> at the time, the War of the Mosques (ph) and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">It's hard to adapt and I once again went to start afresh and to find work. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I I adapted. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Uh I had to...1n order to put bread on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and sometimes I wasn't able to do that perfectly but after ten years I was successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">My son was born and we'll __ for all the sacrifices. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I was able to raise him and to settle, settle him and now I consider that I'm uh I'm all settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I can't say that I am uh I'm rich, but I live, live. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I live and I'm happy this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Especially because all of those people who had been helped by me uh looked for me and they celebrated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">They made me

on anything, we can correspond, but you must write in Italian. . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">There's a lady here, Magadelena (ph), who knew him well. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">She asked me the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And I say at the end of November, I believe, before Sanspritz left, he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Since he was trying to get to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , perhaps he was able with the passport that he had, perhaps he was able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">It was difficult because he was a deserter of the Blue Division of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> which was fighting with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">He had fought in these Divisions next to, with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I don't...I can't...I've tried to find out because he was a very nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">He was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">He was probably twenty-two, maybe twenty-three. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">He was a very nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">He was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">He, he gave me a hand in...several times for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I remember that he came with, he accompanied me. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">But at the end of November he disappeared and that day we didn't see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Yes. ; </span><span class="sentence"
