<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  ... Jewish boys' school and myself being very eager uh to join him but that shouldn't happen though until after 1945 when we returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Um, I don't remember much and I couldn't I imagine, of the actual German occupation but when it started rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Uh the German occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> started .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Could we hold it? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Let's ask a little more about your childhood only because people seeing this tape are not necessarily what traditional native Jewish family means. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Uh, what for instance, uh, did you eat kosher at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Did you light sabbath candles at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, in uh in the early childhood, uh my parents didn't keep a kosher home. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Uh they did do it however later on when I, just after I was bar mitzvahed, uh they started keeping a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , and also my my mother would light the the sabbath candle. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">But we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> uh on the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Uh to please my grandparents I would once in a while go in on the sabbath also but that was really not the, uh something that happened too often. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But my parents were very active in Jewish community life. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> my dad belonged to a number of Jewish organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He headed one of them and uh now if if only I can translate it properly - it would really correspond to what you would call a brotherhood here. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uh, it was meant as support organization where small independent un entrepreneurs, uh business people, tailors, etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="15">what they, when in need they could loan money to get through a period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Then they would repay it. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And it was often, it was all organized by this small organization which was quite powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then at the same time the organization also got involved in the promotion of Yiddish culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Uh they would stage uh performances when there were uh uh Yiddish actors visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Um, now there were at that time and there still are quite a number of Jewish associations in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , in spite of the fact of course that the community was and is rather small. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh today the community is about the same size as it was before the Second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh just around 7,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And uh at that time there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish boys school</span> and there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish girls school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Now they've been, uh after the war they were combined into one. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And it takes the kids up through uh <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> , through <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , but then for further education, uh the kids have to attend the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> or other <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  You were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Did you go to a <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> of some kind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes, I did go to the new Jewish uh <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> which was located the same place as the <span class="BUILDING">girls' school</span> was at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Uh, I remember going to the uh <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> , mostly because I hated it when I was forced to take an afternoon nap. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But uh I do remember some of the things that happened at at the <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> , where we were taught uh things that perhaps you wouldn't be teaching in <span class="BUILDING">Christian schools</span> in the sense that uh - well the old Jewish tradition of putting such great emphasis on children's education. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Uh now I can mention here that the <span class="BUILDING">boys' school</span> took in uh the boys already at the age of five and started teaching them proper Danish etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Uh where as <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> only took in uh students at the age of seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So also in the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , at the age of four or uh, you would be, uh they would start teaching you uh proper subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  What did they teach you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Well, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It's it's difficult today to say what I learned at the age of three, four and five or, but uh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Honestly I can't specify. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I couldn't. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  You probably sang songs .. .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Exactly, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We learned how to spell. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We learned the letters and that kind of uh stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  What about outside of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Uh, what, your playmates, were they all Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Was it a mixed group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  It was definitely a mixed group. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And this was very typical of a Jewish family at that time and even today in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> because Jews have lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> since the 17th century. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Uh during the early part of the 17th century the then king who was King Christian IV, declared a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , in the southern part of (ph), an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and that was, for good reasons he needed to have people come in and help finance his various wars, and uh he also uh wanted to what at that time must have been called industrialize the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so he took in people who knew about tobacco trade and tobacco manufacture. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And uh, well the the Danish Jewish population really originated at that time but of course there was a big influx or/and revitalization of the Jewish community in the early part of this century when at the time my grandparents came in, there was a big immigration from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> because of the pogroms in uh uh <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and uh the <span class="REGION">Baltic States</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Now...
QUESTION:  So that then affected the community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Well, it did uh and from what I've read, you know, there there were not always agreements between the different type of communities. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There were the old established Danish Jewish communities who had ancestors living 1n in in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> for perhaps up to 200 years or more, and then there were these new immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And uh from what I've heard my parents tell at least, uh there was quite a distinction made between the two groups of Jews during the early part of this century but but of course this is a distinction which doesn't exist any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Uh, now the Jewish population remained relatively stable uh between the wars but uh after the war there was some immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And also uh there was a general Danish immigration although on a small scale to the States and among them were some Danish Jews who went over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There were some Danes who, uh Danish Jews who stayed on in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> after the end of the Danish or uh German occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So the population the Jewish population in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> after the war, let's say in the late '40's, went down to about 5,000, 5,500. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But then in the late '60's, as a result of the unrest and the difficulties in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , there was a new influx of Polish Jewish immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Uh, a couple of thousand came 1n uh just around 1970. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And now forms of course an integral part of the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But again, uh you asked about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> - did I play with with uh non-Jews as well as Jews, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And and I said I certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And this again has to do with the fact that although the Jewish population has received new waves of immigrants through the uh but not waves, but a few times this has happened, the Jewish population in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> has always been very much assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Uh, when you speak about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> you you don't classify them as such, as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You classify them as Danes of Jewish extraction or Jewish religion or Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You don't distinguish between groups whether a person is a Catholic or Jewish or he is uh Lutheran or he's an atheist. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh, this could be due to the fact also that the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> has for centuries not really been powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">You know, something like 90- odd percent of the Danish population belongs to the <span class="BUILDING">State church</span> which is the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But if you look at church attendance in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , it's down to a few percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, this has to do with the fact that that you don't you don't feel that there is a difference between, when as a kid, playing with uh Jewish friends or non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I I guess that to go on from there, there weren't anti-Semitists. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There really hasn't, for a long, long time, has had no real meaning in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh, what perhaps could be perce... uh conceived as anti- Semitism, anti-Semitism, in the sense that there's a word - to steal, from old, old Danish or northern which 1s called 'to Jew' something. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The person using that word, the non- Jew using that word, is not associating with something being Jewish, but it's an old, old word that was adopted in the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You hear it very, very seldom today. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I heard it as a kid, and I would react. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But uh I feel confident that it was not, when the person used it about another person, it was not really to classify in an ethnic group. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It was more that the word had become common usage and I think also that the events during the 2nd World War proved uh beyond any doubt that there is no basis for anti-Semitism in a society like the Danish, or in a north European environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Let's take it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">You have grown up in this family, playing with other kids, Jewish and non-Jewish, what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You've been going to this <span class="BUILDING">boys school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Uh, but life changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Life changed presumably when the Germans came in, or did it? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Tell us what happened when the Germans first came. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">How did it affect your life, or did it affect your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  I don't think it did in the beginning. (</span><span class="sentence" id="90">OK) Uh, now you must remember that when the Germans came in and occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> the uh, on April 9, 1940, the Germans didn't call it an occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They came to support <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> against an attack from the Allied forces and quite openly they also came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in order to secure their own passage up to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh, when the Germans crossed the <span class="DLF">Danish borders</span> in the early morning of April 9, 1940, there was a little armed resistance but the govern... the then-government and the then-king uh decided very fast to stop resistance simply because it was so evident it was an impossible task to stop the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Uh, it would mean an incredible bloodshed if a serious effort was made to stop the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So instead the Danish government decided to see if they could have a, if they could carry out negotiations with the Germans in order to reduce the German's, the German influence in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , while <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was being occupied by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And in in the beginning it seemed that it was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The Danish government stayed on as a government. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">The Danish police force was allowed to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Uh the Danish army as such was disbanded and so was the uh the navy, but the police force remained the controlling uh force in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and of the many, no, let me put it another way - uh of course there was a lot of give and take between the Germans and the Danes at that time on on an official level. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But one of the things that was made abundantly clear to the Germans was that the Danes would never accept the execution of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The Jewish issue was not an issue in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and would not be. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The government could not tolerate that it be made an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And this was respected by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Uh, I don't remember much from the first few years of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Uh the clearest impact was from just a month before, when we speak about the war I mean, there were a lot of things from my childhood, but but this also actually goes to to to indicate that the changes in the daily life were not that many. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But I remember clearly on August the 28th, 1943, uh we had our annual family tour of the <span class="DLF">Tivoli Gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The <span class="DLF">Tivoli Gardens</span> are something completely unique for <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> - it's an <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> ; it's a <span class="DLF">flower garden</span> ; it's got 23 <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> ; and it's right smack in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> ; and it, there is no entertainment or <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> in the world like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I'm Dane and I'm proud of it and I'll insist there's nothing like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And for a kid being taken to the <span class="DLF">Tivoli Garden</span> was usually the highlight of the summer season and we had been in, was normally once during the, early part of the season which starts in, around the first of May and then one the late uh part of the season. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I remember clearly that evening on the uh August the 29, I'm sorry - August 28, 1943, when leaving the <span class="DLF">Gardens</span> there was a crowd in the <span class="DLF">street</span> looking on as an enormous convoy of German tanks rode through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Of course, as a kid, I didn't know that the cause of it was that it had come to an impasse between the Danish government and the German occupation forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And on the following day the pow... the Danish government stepped down, refused to cooperate with the Germans any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And the Police Corps, the Danish police force uh was disbanded at, rather they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , a large number of the Danish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But this I guess is one of the early, of earliest clear memories I have from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But there's another, there's another memory which perhaps, I don't know - I think it's actually half a year or year earlier - uh being called out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> by my elder brother in early evening to see a fantastic red hue over the evening sky and that turned out to be a sabotage, the effect of a sabotage of I think the <span class="BUILDING">Danish sugar factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So that they shouldn't be supplying to the German troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And you could see simply the fire lighting off the evening sky. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It could have been half a year earlier but I'm not, I'm not completely sure of the of the date of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Did your brother later tell you what this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  No, I I remember, I I remember having heard, hearing these are the <span class="BUILDING">sugar factories</span> going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh, then uh I remember after August 29, 1943, which was really the crucial day in the occupation history, the German occupation history of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , because uh I think to a large extent the Danish population wanted to disassociate themselves completely from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh now one shouldn't forget that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for more than 100 years - that's not quite true - let's say from 1849 - has always been considered the big brother down south. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We had, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had wars against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1849 - we were lucky at that time - there were some other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> that helped us beat the Germans, but in 1864 we were severely beaten and part of the Danish, <span class="REGION">southern Danish territory</span> was taken away from them and and taken over by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Part of that <span class="REGION">territory</span> was was given back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> after the Ist World War in 1919, but there's always been an an apprehension against these very very powerful Germans just south of the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So to go back to to August 29, 1943, I think for a large part of the population, there was a bit of an urgency to disassociate themselves from the Germans and they, I think many of them heaved a sigh of relief that finally the Danish government refused to further cooperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Uh everybody knew I guess, I'm speaking about the adults, everybody knew no doubt that it would mean uh hardships because now the Germans were in total power, total control. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But uh on the other hand uh people couldn't accept uh how the Germans were behaving in Europe and such because although the press was completely censored and controlled by the Germans - one shouldn't forget that the BBC was broadcasting all the time and although of course it was under strict penalty to listen to BBC everybody did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And information about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and what had happened to minority groups, what was happening to minority groups, as to all the Jews in Europe, had started to had started to come up to their <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And...
QUESTION:  What was, excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">What was the atmosphere of your family at this time, after the 29th?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  After the 29th, very much an atmosphere of apprehension, that uh something bad could happen and that we should be prepared for it and that perhaps we would have to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">This did happen, the talk about that, during the month of uh September. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And now the whole atmosphere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> changed very much uh because there was a curfew on after the 29th of August and you could feel that things were not going the right way. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I think that even a kid at that time could feel it, and perhaps what the kid could feel most was the apprehension of his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And all the elders. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Uh, but still I would say that when it happened, that day that my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the early afternoon, and he usually worked very very hard - uh leave very early in the morning and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> rather late - but when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said, pack up your or rather don't pack up your things, because we're not going to take any luggage, but put on as many clothes as you could possibly have on you without being very conspicuous uh - it did come as a surprise that we had to leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And that was on, let's see now, September 30th, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">That means that it was actually the day before the you you might perhaps have heard that there was a warning issued to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, and that was on October Ist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Were you in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and did you hear ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Because we heard it the day the day before and that had to do with the fact that my dad was so much involved in community work uh in uh within the Jewish associations, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Uh but it was only the following day that the warning was issued from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  You heard it the day before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Your father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said you had to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, I said we we were told that uh uh that we couldn't bring any luggage whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That we should put on as many warm clothes as we possibly could, and we went over and stayed over night with uh some friends of my parents, some Christian friends of uh of my parents, and we were told that we would just be staying for one night, which also happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And and the following morning, we went, the whole family, to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> down to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Uh, I remember that, again this happened time and again during the escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , that we were told try not to be conspicuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">That's very very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And, well, I would say that I understood that this was serious, but I did also feel that to some extent this was an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I don't think you can expect much else from from a six year old kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Uh there was definitely an element of adventure involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Uh there's one instant that, from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride which took about four to five hours, that I very very clearly remember ...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Four to five, or forty-five?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Four to five. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Four or five hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Uh if we had a map I could show you, but I've got it in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It doesn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Uh I remember we were sitting 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; and suddenly I saw the <span class="DLF">door</span> open at the other end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And my uh mother's younger sister with her husband came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And I was about to say something to my mother about it, and my dad looked at me and said, "Don't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Don't say hello. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Don't greet them." </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Again it was...and I found that very strange, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But afterwards, I was told that no it was just that people shouldn't notice that something unusual was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Now, we came down to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">southern Danish city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nykebing Falster</span> , which is on an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zealand</span> [Dan: Sjaelland], which is the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> where you got the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And we were put up at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And I remember that the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> owner's daughter was told - she was a girl of sixteen, seventeen, yes - was told to take a walk with the kids, which she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And she showed us the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">That's that was not until the following day because we arrived there late in the afternoon, and after an early dinner we were sent up to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And then the next morning while I was told that my dad was busy, uh and that was with his contacts to get across to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , uh we went out on this walk with the uh young girl, and we were told that we would have a very early dinner and a big one because it was going to last us for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">At the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there were other families staying which I didn't know until we were, came down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> , that they were all going by the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Uh...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Did you hear any details, any rumors of how those people got there? </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Any sense of organization behind this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Only afterwards I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I heard afterwards that this route that we followed was organized and financed to a large extent uh by a very very well-known uh Danish business man, uh Christian business man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  His name was Buglon Jansen (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="185">He owned and operated uh kind of small <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> and household articles right in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> on the <span class="DLF">City Hall Square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Was a very well-known personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And - but we had this, this must have been, now we are speaking about the 30's, we left on the 30th, now we are speaking about the 2nd of October.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You are still at this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  We're still at this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we were given an early dinner and then we were told that as soon as it starts getting dark or just before dark, at dusk, we will leave and we were put in to a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> - <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> using the old wood-burners. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">There was no gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Yes, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They drove on on the energy from from wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Wood and coal they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And it was not completely dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">It must have been, it was dusk, and dusk lasts in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> normally around an hour or so, and we were driven out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and then I remember that we came on a small <span class="DLF">country road</span> and came to the start of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where there was uh - what do you call it - it was a <span class="DLF">private road</span> , so uh there was a - what do you call it (a <span class="DLF">gate</span> ) - there was a <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And we waited for a couple of minutes and then uh a man came out from a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> so that we could drive through this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">private forest</span> and if I'm not mistaken, I seem to recall that there were about three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Now we stopped short of a <span class="DLF">beach</span> , a very rocky beach, and now it was getting really dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And we went down to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and there were a number of us - afterwards I found out there were seventeen people - and one could hear the sound of a diesel engine coming closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That was the only sound we could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And there something happened on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> which my dad has - he always commented on it later on - and I don't know if he did it so many times and that's the reason why I remember it as if I remember it myself - but this really proved that I apparently I did understand the gravity of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Because my dad was a chain smoker of cigars, and my dad was about to light a cigar ... TAPE BREAK ... "Dad, don't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> can see you." </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So I'm, honestly, I believe I remember it but it could be because I've been told this so many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But uh, there's little doubt that that I did, and so did my my sister and brother, appreciate the severity of the situation, the seriousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Now, then we were taken on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , which was an old, very very smelly fishing boat. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And uh we were taken downstairs where we were told to lie down on some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and my sister complained when she uh lied down that uh there was something very hard underneath her. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And when when uh the uh blanket was pulled away, it it was a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It was a rifle or something like that, which of course was exciting to the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Anyway uh we started, and that time this, now it was absolutely pitch black <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and what I remember from the voyage, except for being sea sick a couple of times - I don't know really whether, how much of it I remember it myself or how much of it I remember because I've been told, but uh I remember wailing, uh in the sense that people uh people are crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Uh, I remember the engines stopping and hearing shouts up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , and uh this was as I said a very old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and uh the engines had since stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So they worked on them and got them going again. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">This happened twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Then also uh we, and this I don't know whether I was told afterwards or I was told during the trip, but the uh heart of the of the of the screaming and crying was due to the fact that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German patrol boats</span> caught uh sight of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And they had two young skippers who had never tried to run a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Uh they, this I must have been told afterwards, they took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> right in to the <span class="DLF">mine fields</span> hoping that the drop was so shallow that nothing would happen and knowing that at least the Germans wouldn't pursue us 1n there. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And uh fortunately the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was shallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">During the night uh I remember being, people being sea sick, all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And then, when daylight broke, I heard new screaming and this, I've been told afterwards I know for sure, was because when people looked up from the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , and looked for, we had reached <span class="REGION">land</span> , or rather we had approached <span class="REGION">land</span> , and we had approached a small <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , a <span class="DLF">fishing harbor</span> or <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">People got scared when they saw uniformed uh soldiers or police on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piers</span> because the Swedish military uniforms were very much like the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They were this green color. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But uh, we did get in to the <span class="DLF">port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And that voyage took eleven hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Uh normally you can cross between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> at the closest point in twenty minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But my dad had explored the possibilities for crossings uh up north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> where there's very narrow, uh this sound as it's called between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It's very narrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But the risk was too big. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And that, let me back track just a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Afterwards I was told that the reason why we met uh our, my my uncle and my aunt on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was that they went down south to to investigate possibilities of getting over on another route, and afterwards they realized that that was too risky. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They had to go up north again. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So they only came over to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> about four or five days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Uh
QUESTION:  Back up one more minute. (</span><span class="sentence" id="234">Yes, sure.) </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Before you go on, I would like to go back to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">You have said you had two young men who had never sailed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> like that before. (</span><span class="sentence" id="237">Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">That's right.) </span><span class="sentence" id="240">How old were they and how did they do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">What kind of help did they have, if any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Well, they were as as far as I recall just around the twenties uh the two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Nineteen, twenty, or twenty, twenty-one. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Uh somehow or other they had been recruited to sail the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and they had offered to sail the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And uh they had been given some maps but uh they really didn't know much about the route over. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Uh afterwards I was told, when we learned it in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , they went on to the <span class="COUNTRY">UK</span> to join the the free Danish forces in the <span class="COUNTRY">UK</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Do you know their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  No, I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I don't unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh, the, this voyage really came to a very dramatic end in the sense that uh only two uh hours after we had landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> sank in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Uh, so uh it was a good thing for us that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> only took, the trip only took eleven hours and not thirteen or thirteen and a half hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  What happened to you ... .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Well, we were greeted by Swedish police and taken very well care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where the whole family was given a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there I remember we had a chance to to wash and to sleep, but being six years old one is of course one very adult so I said all the time I didn't feel like sleeping and there was a double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and my parents uh lay down on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and also my older sister and brother, and I didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I had no interest in in being cramped in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , plus of course I was very adult being six years and uh didn't matter that I hadn't slept that much that night, so I sat down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> at the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and of course it took ten minutes before I was asleep in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But uh we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> we...this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we arrived at is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trelleborg</span> , and it's at the very southern tip of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And the next day, my dad uh phoned some friends, Jewish friends, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> [Eng: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gothenburg</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">This friend was uh a well-known industrialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He ran several uh uh <span class="BUILDING">garment factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and he was a personal close friend of my maternal grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So they arranged that we went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gothenburg</span> and stayed there for a couple of days and then we went further up to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> uh where my dad worked at one of the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> owned by this friend of my my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And uh my mother had to work there because to to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">My dad didn't bring any money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Uh whatever he did, he used to pay for our voyage, although the the route as such was financed as I mentioned before by this Danish businessman, who ever could pay should pay and however much because then in turn some people who couldn't pay would also uh be carried over. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And uh my dad had a small uh <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> - a small <span class="BUILDING">garment factory</span> which was left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And uh so he had to start completely afresh in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And we lived in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> where my dad and my mother both worked at this <span class="BUILDING">garment factory</span> and uh the three of us, the three kids, were sent to a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Swedish public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And I think that we as kids, while we we didn't definitely we were not made to suffer uh my dad and mom combined could make a living although it was more of a subsistence living than it was a luxury living. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But uh...
QUESTION:  What did your mother do while your father was at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  She was also uh working in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I don't remember exactly what her job was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">My my dad worked there as a cutter. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I don't remember exactly what my mother did. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But that and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> for about six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  What was it like there? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You were now how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Well, the first few days of the, was a bit strange because uh we spent, I think we spent a couple or first actually a couple of weeks at a big <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> belonging to this Swedish Jewish industrialist, and this and in this <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> there were a number of other families also waiting to be channeled out into uh more normal life in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And uh there one lived together with other families in exactly the same situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So uh it was not living in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> as much those couple of weeks as living in a Danish Jewish environment in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , and of course everybody was affected but uh by what had happened to them and whether all their family had managed to escape or there were some of their relatives who had been taken by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Uh I should mention here of course that out of the population of around 7,000 uh Danish Jews, uh more than ninety percent managed to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and uh uh only a very few were taken by the Germans and uh of the Danish Jews, the Danish Jews were all taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , which although of course it it was, 1t was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and it was a sub-human way of of living, it was considered one of the milder uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Uh but of course, during those couple of weeks we stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in in north, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> all talk, what ever was discussed concerned what had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and what had happened to relatives and uh people were delighted of course when they had phone calls from other relatives who had managed to to arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and and could tell that they were safe etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Uh after about, I think we were there for two weeks 1n that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we moved into the the the proper city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> where we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> of our own and that's when we started attending Swedish uh <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and uh there were a couple of other refuge families living in the same <span class="DLF">block</span> but apart from that we had Swedish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I mean as kids we had Swedish playmates, went to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and they came to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We we, I guess we, that hap... that was the case of for our kids, all during the time in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> that again my parents arranged for a secure family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So that uh no doubt we were protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Uh we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> for six months, and then we moved down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gothenburg</span> uh where my dad uh got another job with within the same group and uh after about, and we started, let me mention that of course, that when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gothenburg</span> , we were able to attend a <span class="BUILDING">Danish school</span> that was established for refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gothenburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Let's hold... go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">From the time you got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , to the time you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> , you as a child went through a whole lot of changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">How did you feel at the various stages? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">You were at first but what did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  There was again uh uh more of an adventure, no doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh but again but more important I could feel how concerned my parents were. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And that of course affected, would affect any child. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Uh also I could feel when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , when we landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , that my parents were relieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">This would affect a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Uh more apt to to make a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Uh not only the child but the parents and that affected their whole outlook on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Uh going by by by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> up through <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And and one thing clearly stands to my mind and that was on the way up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> , I think I mentioned that we stayed for a a couple of nights in the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> of this industrialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And I'll never, I'll never forget at night looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and seeing all the neon lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> had a blackout uh forced upon them by the Germans since 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">You never saw neon lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">You never saw street lights because you you had to black out everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That was impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Also that fact that you could buy chocolate which was a luxury - well it didn't exist in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">You could buy bananas. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">That was certainly something new. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I was just used to eating artificial banana made made made from extras, some extract or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Sugar etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Uh this was a new life in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But of course the the important part was really the the family nucleus. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That it was safe being together with the parents and and the sister and the brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Uh and also when we moved to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> , my maternal grandparents came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Uh so I guess as a as a kid although it was under strange foreign circumstances it was very much of a traditional life for for a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It was a very secure family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Uh the the change not in the feeling of security but the change in the family life came in - it must have been mid or the fall perhaps of 1944 when my dad uh joined the uh Danish uh Brigade as it was called, the the uh the Danish military police force that was built up in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> towards the end of the 2nd World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And uh, with the approval of the Swedish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And uh in very close contact with the Danish underground movement and with the uh so-called free-Danish army in the <span class="COUNTRY">UK</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Uh my dad only came back to visit us perhaps once, twice a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And uh again, perhaps it it wouldn't be different for a family life even without a war but but where the dad is away. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But of course we felt that the dad was not there. ( ) </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Well, perhaps some more responsibility, a feeling of responsibility although I was a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Or or the baby rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">My brother uh was uh, he was bar mitzvahed in in March '45 and of course he was the one who really had to take the responsibility while the while our dad was away. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But again, I was six, I was seven at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I was seven - I must have been at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I guess I wasn't much different from other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Uh except at certain moments when I felt that it wasn't completely like other families, like like the Swedish playmates were, like they had their family life uh because we're living in a foreign country, all the time speaking about going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">There was little doubt about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We were listing to the uh the Danish radio from uh the BBC to hear about the events and uh I guess what it did mean was that uh in some respects at least a mature... a maturity in some <span class="DLF">fields</span> that uh you wouldn't normally see in in a seven year old kid which which would be a natural reaction I would think. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Uh...
QUESTION:  Could we hold it for a minute? </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They have to change the tape and then we will go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  ... for a seven year old alone with brothers and sisters, father away... .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Yeah, but you know, one thing is certain and that is we were, there was this very positive inference in knowing all the time we would be going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">There was never doubt that we would be going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And this of course gives a sense of security.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  You knew that your people were . . .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Oh yes, exactly, exactly, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION TAPE #2
QUESTION:  Now, we have a lot to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Your father 1s away at the .. .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Yeah, that's right and uh the uh uh family living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> and he is quite a distance away and coming back perhaps once a month or so for for an extended weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Uh we were, my dad was paid the equivalent of a salary while in the army simply so that the family could be supported. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Uh so life in many ways went went on as it had while he had been there but of course the dad wasn't there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  What did you pick up from your mother in terms of uh how she felt and how she was carrying on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  My mother has always been a very very calm person. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Always very much in control uh of herself and although my dad was a very very strong personality, the typical Jewish father, uh the patriarch of of the family, my mother certainly proved that she could run the family during his absence. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Uh I think that you asked me before what it meant to to a six year old boy or seven year old boy to live under such conditions - I think it's true for all of us that we matured very much from the experience and we learned to cope with things. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Well, you have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So out of necessity we learned how to manage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  What did that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">What did coping mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">What kinds of things... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Well, I don't I don't think our world was much different from other kids but perhaps still there was a feeling that 1t was very important to behave so as not to create more problems because we were all aware as kids that it was a very difficult time for our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And it's not that we didn't misbehave. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Of course we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We were kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But I think that we had, we we had a perception of try not to create more problems than necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now whether my parents felt the same way I'm not sure, although I am because my parents have afterwards commented that we did behave uh extremely well as kids during these very trying years. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But of course we we made the same kind of tricks as all other kids did but there was still this sense of there's a limit to what you can do, allow yourself to do because it is causing additional problems for the grown-ups.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  Mischief, but not real mischief?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Exactly, exactly, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And of course there is little doubt either that that living through through such a period ties the family extremely strongly together. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Very much so because you become dependent - you you realize how dependent you become on each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with your brother and your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  The normal relationship between an older brother and a younger brother in getting annoyed if asked by the parents to take me along to something he wanted to do with his with his peers and uh me crying if he if he wasn't too happy about taking me along and making me feel it, but uh normal kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  What happened then? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Uh...
ANSWER:  Well, during the spring of '45, everybody knew what was going to happen but nobody knew when it would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Uh...
QUESTION:  Again, how did you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You, at age eight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Well, from from hearing it, from my brother who was very mature of course under the circumstances at the age of thirteen and from hearing it from my mother, from hearing it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and and of course the sources were partly the Swedish news media. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But uh again the most important source of information was the BBC's, the British Broadcasting Service's Danish service and there I can assure you I do remember as if it were yesterday, on the eve of May 4th, 1945, uh my mother was out at some function but the three kids, we were alone in the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> , and we had the radio on, and then we certainly heard, suddenly heard the message from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> that the German forces in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , Best...(ph), and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had capitulated with effect on the following morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Uh, that made quite an impression, even on kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But again, a sense of adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">That was an element of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But there was also this sense of feeling that now we knew for sure our parents would be happy and that we would be going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Describe the scene?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  I remember we jumped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Uh, but strangely enough I, I remember clearly listening to the radio and hearing the news, and that we jumped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , but I don't remember what happened when my mom came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But uh I know that during the following days there was of course jubilation everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And we were growing very impatient to because we wanted to know when could we get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Uh the following day we uh heard, uh my mother had a phone call from my dad that he was going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> with the police force because they had been ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">That police force, the Danish police force in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , if uh the war had dragged on, if the occupation had dragged on, the plan was that the police force should go in to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> as a military unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Uh but fortunately that wasn't necessary so it went in in the morning of May 5th, which was the day of the, the official day of the liberation and took over the police functions in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and my dad was in on on the 5th of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And then I remember during the the uh the following weeks very often my mother was called to the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">My dad was calling, telling how things were going, and we were all waiting to know when will we be allowed to go back and uh, I remember when we went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> finally, on June Ist, and took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">That was quite something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  What was it like, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">This this was, well, this was just one victorious train ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Uh people singing, people jubilating. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Uh it was like you see a sports team coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from a victory in in many ways, and of course lots of people crying of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So uh that was on the Ist of June that we returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Describe what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Did you go back to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">What had happened was that neighbors of ours had promised to look after our <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> but they had taken over the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so there wasn't any <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Uh and uh the same thing had happened to my dad's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where uh a friend had promised to look after it but uh there was no <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But but these are, these were minor things. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They were considered minor things and I wouldn't say they were typical either but it it happened to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Uh we were, the first few nights we were back we were staying with friends of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">He was the, he was as a non-Jewish head of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish boys school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Oh yes, such a thing could happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Oh yes, easily can can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Uh he was a very very highly respected uh teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He was non-Jewish, but but he was head of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish boys school</span> , so we stayed with them for a couple of days and then my dad had found a <span class="BUILDING">summer cottage</span> up in the <span class="REGION">country-side</span> where we used to go for summer holidays, and we spent the summer there and then my dad found a a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> where we uh where we moved back to when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started and then normal life began again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  Take it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">You had a <span class="BUILDING">lodge</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Describe for us what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> looked like to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  You know, I was, I remember, much to my surprise, I didn't recognize the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I had been away for a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I had been so absorbed first in living the Swedish way with the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish schools</span> , then living a normal life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> that the year and a half I didn't remember the <span class="DLF">road</span> , I didn't recall the <span class="DLF">road</span> really, or didn't remember the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> going from the from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to where we were staying but when we came to where we were staying I remembered it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But this was like, to me <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> was was really at that time was like visiting a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for the first time until I got to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were living, because that was just across from uh where we had, where we used to have our <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> or our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  Had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> been damaged?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Not not compared to to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Uh there was some damage but nothing compared uh to what you saw in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but what was remarkable was due to the shortages of all kinds during the war, you saw very very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">You saw horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> but very very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And that lasted for about four or five months, and then you saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> coming back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  What about your neighbors? </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Uh, or in this case not your neighbors, you were staying temporarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Uh how did people, how did Christian Danes greet you when you back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Very very warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Extremely warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Uh, I guess for them also there was little doubt that we would be returning. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">This was just an an episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was something temporary, that we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Uh, again, let me go back all the way to what I said before or in the beginning - Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was not an isolated ethnic minority group. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They were Danish of Jewish extraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So they, we were neighbors and nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I guess this is a very important aspect when when we talk about what happened uh during the 2nd World War in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And then I know that, I've uh given a few speeches on the events of October '43 in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and I know it's said well but look at other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where people also assimilated and it didn't help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But this 1s just one of the other ones because you must take it as a whole where the important part being the proximity to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , the fact that the Germans were disorganized in October '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Not disorganized but unorganized. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They had not yet established their own civilian uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fleets</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol fleets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Uh there were many Germans sympathetic to the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The worst part, the the worst uh were really the the Danish Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">There were a few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But but no large number but there were they were there and they were uh they were rather influential. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">One shouldn't forget that the warning to the Danish Jews about the uh the impending persecution was given by uh a staff officer of the <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Uh...
QUESTION:  Contradictions abound.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  But you have come back, and you have rebuilt your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Day by day. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Did it all return to normal? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Did you feel it returned to normal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  Well, I don't think so, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Uh for me personally, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But there were distant relatives who were caught and who were affected by it, for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">My dad was affected by it for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Uh, it was said at I don't know - well, he turned white-haired over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Uh I know he was white- haired uh all during the the late forties, and the fifties, and sixties, although he was, in 1943 he was 30 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But it affected distant relatives who had uh close close relatives taken by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Uh, it, but that's the negative part of it but in the positive, there was also a positive effect on this very very close knit family, getting even, becoming even closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Uh, did did things change from what they had been before? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Perhaps not, perhaps not because sure enough my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and had to start all over again, but was very successful with that also. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Uh it didn't change our attitude of how we felt towards neighbors or how neighbors felt towards us. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Uh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We at the same time as appreciating all the good things that had happened under such a situation of crises, I don't know if perhaps because of knowing what the Germans did - not the Germans, the Nazis - I think one should distinguish there - that uh there was a tendency to grow more cynic than had been the case before. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">If you were to ask me if my life would have been different if I hadn't had that experience as a kid, uh I guess yeah, it could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I guess it could have been different. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Uh, 1t could have been different in my relationship first of all with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But in my...
QUESTION:  You've just. .. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">how do you thing it would have been different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  Well, I think this had the the very positive effect of creating this extremely close-knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Uh with family values, the old traditional values being perhaps even more respected than if we hadn't been through this as a family together. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">You've seen all over the <span class="REGION">Western world</span> the break-up of the family pattern, and uh a crisis situation like this of course works the other, the opposite way. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Uh, but it could have been another type of crisis of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">It could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Uh, but of course it also makes one appreciate the kind of <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I'm living in or rather I'm coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Again uh you perhaps you've met it yourself as an American, but Danes feel extremely embarrassed today more than 45 years after the events, to be reminded of their good deeds, and that this was the miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Uh being Danish of Jewish family I can see both sides of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Uh I can see that to some extent it was a miracle but that the miracle also to some extent had natural causes. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Uh, but I mean it when I say that that Danes feel embarrassed when being praised today for their actions in October 1943, and it's not out of modesty. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But it's out of surprise why anybody should praise them for doing something for their fellow Danes. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">This was not done for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">It was done for fellow Danes. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I think that is worthwhile to note.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  I can't think of a better ending.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  I want to take you back one more step. (</span><span class="sentence" id="491">Sure.) </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I'd like to go back to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">You had described it as really going from the north to south of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  Well yeah, in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> it would be almost from the north to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Is it a very long trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Denmark</span> is a small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> don't forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  Even so, uh and you were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">You have said that this was and you described some of the instances of this particularly harrowing trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Uh, did you as a child feel it as being harrowing? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Is there one incident that stands out in your mind, seeing your sister, sister-in- law...
ANSWER:  Uh I knew that it was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">There's little doubt about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I knew that we were exposing ourselves to some grave risks. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">What those risks were I was not quite uh aware of, but I knew it was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">At at anything that I did as a kid not, not by not doing what I was told, could put our family at risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I was aware of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So in that sense I think I knew that I had to act very responsibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And then we go back to the question about maturity. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  Anything you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  Uh, I really don't know what what we have left out. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Uh I really don't - there's not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Because what we've been talking about here more than anything else have been the personal experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We're not talking about the general situation and the historical events, uh chronological events. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">No, I don't think there 1s much else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Let's pick up one more thing and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">You have arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and you are now temporarily at least settled with both parents working. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Uh what was your life like uh as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Well of course there was the Swedish uh there was the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stock</span> ... in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> , but I think it was more a life as a Dane in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> than it was as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Uh, now most of the refugees living in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> or at least in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">G6teborg</span> , uh were, most of the Danish refugees were Jewish but there were also a number of non-Jewish refugees who had been active in political movements, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">etc and who had had to flee uh <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and the Danes stopped uh pretty close to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Uh there would be all kinds of functions of either on the <span class="REGION">entertainment side</span> or could be cultural but it could also be uh a function to talk about events as they were happening, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And when you talk about the Scandinavians, Danes have always been known to be the uh the good-humored uh ones, not so formal as particularly the Swedes are. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">The Danes like to have fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The Swedes very often like to join in. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The Danes are not always too happy to let them join in, and there was a standing practice when they had these Danish functions which were restricted to Danes and/or Danish Jews, but we didn't separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We didn't distinguish them. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">There was a catch word. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Uh in order to get in you'd have to pronounce a special Danish dish which is completely impossible to pronounce for a person who wasn't born and raised in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and exposed exposed to the Danish language since early infancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And uh uh it was not very polite to the Swedes. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">They were our hosts, sure enough, but uh there was a, I definitely want to emphasize that it was a Danish feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">It was not a Danish/Jewish feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It was Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Uh we had the <span class="BUILDING">Danish schools</span> , uh the <span class="BUILDING">Danish school</span> , and uh uh we had a Danish Boy Scout uh Troop there. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Uh the kids I associated with would be my classmates from the <span class="BUILDING">Danish school</span> but also some of the Swedish kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Uh, I'm sure of course that there are also was a very active Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> , but this was not really what I noted. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I noted a Danish life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  The Swedish kids who uh, you related well with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">No problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Uh when we first moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> , the Danish school had not been formed yet, so I think for four or five months, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish public school</span> as I had done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uddevalla</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And together with my sister I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish public school</span> summer camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And when I returned from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> - it was a six-weeks camp - I didn't speak Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I spoke Swedish. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Where did you do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Of course I spoke Danish but it took me close to a week before uh I was back to normal Danish again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Out of sheer curiosity, what was the name of the dish that was your password?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  Now I will tell you it - you can try as much as you want to to pronounce it and you couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It's - let me put it this way - it is a fruit, kind of a fruit jelly which is served with cream on it or fruit soup, and it's called . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Now this is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">meaning red porridge which is actually red fruit uh porridge with cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">It's impossible for anybody but a Dane to pronounce.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  And with that note thank you so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  You're welcome. </span>
