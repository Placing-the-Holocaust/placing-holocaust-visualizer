<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Would you tell me, Lily, about your parents and your family when you were a small child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Uh...I was...I had a very sheltered and pampered childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Both my parents were professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My father, David __, was a self-made man. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He was a registered pharmacist... uh...despite the...that he came from a poor religious family, he became very successful after he became a pharmacist. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And he met my mother when he was in the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and both...they were students. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">She studied dentistry and she belonged to the upper class, upper middle class and my grandfather was not too happy where...about this marriage, but when my mother became a dentist and opened her own <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he consented and they got...they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My mother's name was ______. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And she was really a very good professional, a very gracious lady, and a very good mother and wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My parents belonged to this...this students that actually lived very...very actively participated in the Russian revolution and even when they became successful, they still spoke Russian at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and all...all the ideals about the equality and fraternity were very much imbedded in their minds and this...they embedded in us also. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Despite that they worked very hard, there were always time for cultural events and they used to go the <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span> there, a very nice <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and they had an excellent social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I had a younger sister that was born 4 years after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Actually I was born on the <span class="DLF">street</span> called ____4 and my sister was born in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my mother's <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> became too small and we moved to ___ 38, which was...which was the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that I lived til the second war world II. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I have very fond memories of my childhood, and my parents really tried their best to...to make us, me and my sister very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">As soon as I was born I had a nanny and the nanny became a very big part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And even my father who was the real father ____ was afraid of my nanny because she became the boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">She adored my mother, but she actually was the only ones that stood up against my father and [...1t was sometimes when I used to go up and downstairs, it reminded me about her attitude, and her friends because every day she used to take me to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">When I used to go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> , I had to be dressed up...uh...like a little princess. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I... had to wear a little hat, and I had to wear gloves and new shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And when she came there, she met all the other nannies and they were talking and gossiping about their ladies and their bosses what they do there and what they...and what they were and how they spent their evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And one...one wanted to tell the life of their ladies more interesting than the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">If my nanny decided that the dress I was wearing this day was not good enough, she didn't even consult my father or my mother, she just went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where we had credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She bought me material. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">She went to the dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She ordered a dress and this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And so my father got the bill and he asked what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">How come you're spending so much money on little girls that will grow up? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She used to say, "I cannot...I cannot allow my little girl look worse than any other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Do you want us to be poor? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Do you want people to think that we are poor? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We have...we have to have appearances." </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And my father doesn't even say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">When I had...when I was 6 years old, and my parents send me to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">This was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that Jewish children used to go, but we were taught only Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">Private Coeducational</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and it was a private co-educational school called ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And it was located on the <span class="DLF">street</span> on ___ ll. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was a very exclusive <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I have very fond memories about it, because this teacher was a really dedicated and knowledgeable people. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The atmosphere was very congenial and we had all the facility that very often I wish my children would have when they were growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Because we had slides, we had <span class="BUILDING">clinical laboratories</span> , <span class="BUILDING">physical laboratories</span> and we had the ___, and we used to really...had very nice nature trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And the only thing what I cannot forget how we used to admire and respect our teacher who were really trying their best to make our life interesting and also the lessons that they teach were very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">When we studied about the French Revolution, they made like a mock judgment and we were discussing about___ SS head rolled, and in no time we knew what was going on with...without worrying about the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And this...I had a little...uh...I had a very big interest in reading, and very soon...as soon as I studied to...I knew how to read, my father on the suggestion of my mother took me to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and then a new world opened before me because I started to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I...there were days that I had...I finished a book a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Of course, in the beginning was just children's books, but a new world opened in front of me and my mother was very happy because she believed very strongly about culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">She used to drag me and my sister to all...to <span class="BUILDING">children theatres</span> to ballet. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We didn't have an opera, but we had an operata. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And she really used to pump culture into us because she used to say...[ remember it well, "that the person who doesn't appreciate the music or poetry or finest things of life is really half...half blind and half...hard of feelings, because this everything is free, and you have to really appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Coming back to...one second to my mother, I have to tell you that she was my best friend and I was very proud of her because not only was she a big beauty and a real lady, I never saw her without a hat or a pair of gloves, but also she was a very compassionate person. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">She had a very big clientele, and I remember rich landowners coming in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and with those little...uh...horse...horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> , and...and those tall, strong, Polish men were just kissing my mother's hand because she was such a good dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And they used to bring all kinds of presents, but on the other hand the poor people around us knew if they have a toothache or they have a any problem, they just come, ring the bell and come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and my mother would never ask them how much they can pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They pay how much they could, and if they couldn't pay it was alright also. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So she always imbedded in our mind the concept of charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">This idyllic life lasted through 1935, and this was the time when I started to feel the wind of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">My father...my father was working as a registered pharmacist in a very big <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> that was a <span class="BUILDING">government pharmacy</span> from the social services. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Every worker was involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Only 3 Jewish pharmacists were working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They were the students that were on top of the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">In 1935, my father was told and also his two colleagues that they have...in order to work there, they have to obtain a Masters Degree in <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Of course, they had no other choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They studied...they were studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My father used to close himself in...1n his <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and work and study. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He used to go on field trips because the old fashioned pharmacist didn't go and just and pick up the medicine from the shelves. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They have to prepare it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And finally when the tests came...uh...there was an oral test and there was a written test. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The man...the professor that gave him the test was a known anti-Semite and my father was very afraid that he won't pass the test. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But he passed the test with flying colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The written test and the oral. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And as he was getting up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> ...he was practically by the <span class="DLF">door</span> , after he...telling him about so many complicated chemicals formula and everything, all of sudden, the professor asked him, "David ___, and what is the chemical...uh...formula for carbonated water with the C2 03, and my father was so nervous and so upset that he got a mental block and he couldn't answer him. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And he just didn't pass him. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So, of course, he had to study enough and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and after a short time we got the telegram he did pass it. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But after a very short time, a decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a <span class="BUILDING">government institution</span> , and my father lost his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I didn't tell you that my...my father had a brother and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And my...my grandparents on my father's side were very religious, very religious people, and my grandmother had 16 children but only four survived because...uh...the children were...died in the infancy, and after 12 children died, she..there was...uh...folklore in our family telling us that she went to a very famous rabbi and the rabbi told her that he...that if you wanted your children to live, you have to dress them only in white. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Even...only in white, even if they grew...grow up and be able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And when the child will ask you, "Mama, how come everybody dresses in all kinds of different colors and I'm wearing in white...I'm dressed in white," then you can take off and dress the child in any colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And this what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because she kept them in white. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And my...my father had a brother and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The...the...the...the younger brother immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> with one of the sisters went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and one of the sisters lived with her parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and this...this...I just wanted to mention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job, we...my mother had a very close knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And, as I mentioned before, they were upper middle class, and they were six children, two brothers and four sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One sister, as a young girl, got married and immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">One sister got married to a very rich man that was a manufacturer of papers and...uh...my oldest, my mother's oldest sister was a registered nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Her name was Sonia Lipquwich Perski, and she was actually my second mother and my...my mother, as I mentioned you, mentioned to you, was also a professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And they were a very knit families. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The two brothers, one the older brother was a publisher of a Jewish paper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> , and the younger brother...his name was Soloman, was a dentist who didn't practice dentistry but opened a...a business...uh...dental supplies for dentists and mechanics....and dental mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">When it happened, the whole family got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was like a family council and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He couldn't buy a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> , but they found for him a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soley</span> , but then a very tragic thing occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">They didn't want to sell a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> to a Jewish pharmacist. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So imagine a pharmacist, a Christian of Polish persuasion had to be found, a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> was bought. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">This happened in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And my...my...actually my family split because my mother and my sister had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soley</span> and find an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> for my father and we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because my...we were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my mother was practicing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And this was the time that the very tragic event occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My mother got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">My mother developed cancer, and when my father took her to the doctor and she was operated on in one of the best <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> , she was...she was opened and closed and the professor told my father that she had 6 months to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The cancer spread all over her body and you have two little girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You have to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But no...don't count on your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It was a terrible tragedy for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We were, as children, not told about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And the only thing that...that we knew that she was going for treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Then it was cobalt treatments and she used to feel really very bad but a little miracle happened because after 6 months she went into remission and she even started to practice because her patients were so dedicated to her that they...we had to take off the bell from the <span class="DLF">door</span> because everybody would come and just wanted to find out how she is doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Now I have to tell a little story about our dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We had a dog called Rex, which 1s in...with the ____ in Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And we actually grew up with the dog because when I was born, my parents bought this dog and she was our best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The dog always when we used to eat at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the dog was stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> we used to throw him the best morsels. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The only thing if...when the dog was not present when the guests came and my parents were entertaining their colleagues, it was a thing in our family that the...that the children had to be seen but not heard, and they had to disappear together with the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My...when my mother got sick and she was lying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , the dog was sitting near here and there was no power that you should take away the dog from her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The only thing that he used to go...he used to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> when he ...where he had his dish to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And he would eat, drink a little water and lie on his little pillow near my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And the dog...when my mother didn't survive, this what...we felt actually the tragedy in my young life because on May the 22st, the 24th 1939, my mother passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And it was something unbelievable because I was sleeping and all of a sudden I was wakened up by the howling of the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When my mother passed away, the...the dog started to howl so strong that they had to take him out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with the...with the force. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And it was such a big tragedy for me because I adored my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I was proud of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The best day of the week was for me Friday because she wasn't working, and she used to take us to all the functions and used to...she used to take us to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I was so proud of her because she really was so beautiful that strange men used to tip their hats for her...uh..say to her, call her like princess or madonna or queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I was so proud of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My...this is my mother! </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So it was a terrible tragedy for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We had a tremendous funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">All the children from my class and from my mother's class...uh...from my sister's class came. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so many colleagues and sO many patients that we didn't even realize that she had...that she was known by so many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And the dog wanted to go in this...1n this cortege, but he was...the funeral cortege, but he was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the funeral, I was very broken up and I really was so desperate that I thought that the...that the world is finished for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I remember it was May...May is a beautiful month in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> because all the lilacs are growing and the <span class="DLF">air</span> is just perfumated with jasmine and lilacs. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It is the most beautiful time of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So on a Saturday when ____ my little friends took me out and we were walking through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and the sun was shining and the birds were singing and I said to my God, "The life is going on and my mother is not any more with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I couldn't find peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">My teachers came to visit me and I was a very good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Have to remember I was a teacher's pet and studying was very easy for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And all of a sudden...uh...my grades fell down and my teachers when they came to me, they said to me, "You have to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You have to take yourself together." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I told them, "I don't have nothing to...anymore studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I having nothing to live anymore and the writings, articles to the papers because each class had a class paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Was a time even when I was a publisher, an editor actually of the paper and the best article from this paper used to go to a school paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was called The Student's Friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And it was the only <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that had a printed paper from...from the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It was a fascinating paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Oh...sometimes if I...when I remember myself about, I said, "How come they were so serious about the event? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">How come we understood so much?" </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I was really surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  Can you tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Let's...let's move forward a little bit if you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">A Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Can you tell us what happened now? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">After your mother's death and the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Can you tell us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Well, afterwards we...uh...we went...it was summer vacation, and we went to live with my father and my Aunt Sonia came and she stayed with us a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">She kind of became our surrogate mother because she felt...she felt that it was really a big tragedy for both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And...and we had a very sad summer, but actually did...uh...the whole world fall apart...fell apart for us on September 1, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I was sitting in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and preparing actually myself to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I was supposed to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> to continue study. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And then my nanny came running into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and said that my father wants to see us immediately in the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And me and my sister and my nanny were running, and my father said, "Sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The war broke out..broke...break...broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The Germans just invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and we don't know what to do...be, but don't think about going back." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It...1t started because the...the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I couldn't go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

Pole...in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The other one... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> became a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span

class="sentence" id="851">We came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kruma</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">It was <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">As we walked in there, there was a tremendous <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I never saw anything like it, and all of us were put into this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="856">In this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , we met people from all the nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">There were men also. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And...and the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was surrounded by Gestapo, and as we were looking through the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and actually the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were a little open...there were no <span class="DLF">windows</span> , we saw the Gestapo putting out little...twigs, around the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They wanted to burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">It was decided that they didn't know what to do with us anymore, and they wanted to hold up...there were thousands of people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">All kinds of languages that spoke...spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And we were just sitting there, and all of a sudden, it was in the morning, March 11, 1945, that we heard a big commotion, and somebody started to scream, "The Russian are coming." </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And we didn't find one German. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">The German guard disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I was afraid to run out. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I was sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And then...my friends started to scream and yell, 'The Russians are coming." </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And we saw the Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">They occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and one of the Russian soldiers took a rifle and shot a...a German guard, took off his shoes and gave me his boots because the Germans had said if they were very well dressed, and without hesitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I didn't think twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I took this...otherwise, I would never survive because I didn't have shoes to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">You know...we arrived in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there was a <span class="BUILDING">dairy factory</span> and they were making there cheese and cream and people were very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">They used...they ran to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and they were drinking the...the cream and the right there they were vomiting because the stomach...and...and typhoid epidemic started to spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I was infected with typhus then already. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And there was...there was a very big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">It was like a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It belonged to some kind of a Nazi, and the Russian to...to go there and to just to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">They didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">So we were lying there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and people were dying like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">You...you could see...you could just step over dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And in this big commotion,...oh, I met this Hungarian doctor that I was telling you about. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">This Hungarian doctor that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> ,____, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And she...she put...she was...she put herself a Red Cross then, and she was collecting those few girls

<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  We have one minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Can you tell us just very briefly where you were taken?</span></p>
