<p>QUESTION:  And you were going to try to meet the military in the north?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Yeah, so that -- and next day I was fighting with the German troops coming from -- they had been then -- some of them landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and then they came north, and we met them there, and we stopped them for about a good period, a day or two, but we had guns, we had rifles only. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They had artillery, they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and they had all kinds of weapons which we -- you know, it was the strongest army in the world, you know, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  But we kept going two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell in 14 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So I think we did okay, expect what we could expect from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Now, had you been trained with guns?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Well, I had a very little training in the King’s Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But we had -- it’s really interesting this is not so well known in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We had the volunteering, military service among the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We put up that before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So in the -- li -- late ’39, just beginning 1940, we had the voluntary -- volunteers training there. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So that was -- so you may have thought something could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So we were right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  And who started that, students started that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  That was one of my friends, he was a student leader, Knut Moyen, he started that. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And later on he became one of the leaders in a sec -- when we started building up small secret groups, military groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  And were there boys and girls in this or only boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  No, at that time it was only boys, but of course girls in -- in the resistance movement, when we should go for instance, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> to look after what had happened [indecipherable] we used our girlfriends --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  -- because the -- they were not suspected, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But th-they did fine job. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Also, all the -- was girls in resistance movement did a wonderful job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  So after <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> falls, after two months, where -- where are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Have you -- have you met the -- the military in the north, or you never got there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Well, our -- we -- our skiing company fought for about three weeks in southern Norway, then we had to give in, and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> <span class="REGION">southern Norway</span> , then we had to give in, and I went back to Oslo. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And then already some [indecipherable] I got the very bad pneumonia, but I got through it and the same month, more or less, July 1940, I met with some friends at the student’s hut, out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> , north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> <span class="BUILDING">student’s hut</span> , out in the wilderness, north of Oslo. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We started immediately think, what are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="232">What can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It’s now two -- 200,000 Germans here. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Where can we start? </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But we thought we will start slowly, building up small groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Maybe could be an invasion, and we hope for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And -- but one thing was what -- very important, it was all rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The papers were censored, all the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Radios taken, so now it was all rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">It was rumors, rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So we thought you have to do something with this, you have to inform people. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So then we started secret newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was about 350 newspapers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> at that time, and I think it came up about at least so many secret newspapers, not with that circulation of course, but one of the newspaper had the circulation of 25,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The newspaper what was that, we had -- the Norwegian [indecipherable] had put up a -- with BBC, the Norwegian broadcast to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , every evening, 7:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And then these peop -- the news was taken down, that was news from the free world. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It was no propaganda, it was -- we had got all the news from the free world. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And they were put down, and they were magnified -- I mean, they were copied, and then you could have a sheet of paper, you could have 15, and you spread it round, very often where you were working, at your -- 1t was spread, and then the Germans propaganda and anti-propaganda was -- for them it was the worst thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So Gestapo, it was the most terrible thing when -- if you are taken with the -- call it the clandestine newspaper, secretive, you would be arrested, and you could easily be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Or you were put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I think about 20,000 did this during the war, 5,000 are taken into custody, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , many, many died. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And over 200 Norwegian journalists -- call it journalist, they were shot, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Because they fought Nazism with pencil and paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And they were shot, 200 of them are shot during the war, we hear about now. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So it was just incredible how the -- and it was two things that -- that Gestapo was after, but I had a real Gestapo force in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , secret police, security police, they were after people doing these newspapers, and building up small military groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And of course they were after other groups, and later on, of course, the Jews, which we -- which we couldn’t -- didn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We couldn’t expect it at all, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They were Norwegians, they -- to me it was Norwegians, they had Norwegian passport, they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , had -- they were born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">That we couldn’t believe at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  So let’s talk about these newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Ha -- about how many different clandestine newspapers do you think there might have been during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  I think it might have been 350.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">All over <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">About the same as we had before, but of course not with that circulation. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It’s just natural.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  And they were distributed what, individually, you would pass them out to people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Yes, for instance, when you had copied, let’s say 50, you had other coming, fetching them, and of course we also used schoolchildren to distribute them. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Could be old people, young people and schoolchildren, girls and boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They were spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But when they were grown up, they were taken and of course when you had 20 people [indecipherable] you, 1t was seen by some traitors, some informers, they would inform on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They had put up the same as they had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Security police and informers. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">You know, in any <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> you would have one to two percent which are traitors to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the- they were about 4,000 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">In -- over the two, three years, we had 4,000 informers. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And when they saw man with the paper, they informed it to the Gestapo, and that man was tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And of course, he had been to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> getting it, and that was -- of course he -- you cannot stand the torture, it’s impossible with the torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They came to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> with Middle Age torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Middle Age torture, which I had read about, it 1 -- was history, and now they came into open with the Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized, or reorganized Norwegian police. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So they had about, I should say, 20 percent of them got taken into a new state, it was federal police, state police, and they were just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they were as good as any German Gestapo, any German security officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So it was a very -- if you were in that, call it that trade, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be arrested, tortured and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Was a very great risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We all -- they all knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  But it was e-equally as risky to take the newspaper and be seen with it, as it was to deliver it, I gather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Then they would arrest you, they would torture you and say where did you get it from? </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Where -- where did you get it from? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And, of course, they couldn’t stand it, and they -- then they were arrested, others were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But it all the time they kept -- kept on, it was more and more newspapers, secret newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Did you write some of the stuff that went into the newspapers, or did you distribute them, what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  No, we -- I tried a little to begin with, because I started with this in 1940, we already -- we had the newspaper that started already autumn -- fall, ’40, and the -- well, I think it fall -- °41, it was really started, on the -- the very good newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So -- but 1t was written by our best brains, very good articles, and today you can read them in our <span class="BUILDING">resistance museum</span> , they’re all there, you can read them, and very interesting to read now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  So how long did you work with the clandestine newspap -- were you also, by the way, working at this -- as an assistant accountant still? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Did you go back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I tried, but I hadn't had time for this, because now I was a resistant worker on full time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Full time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  So then I started to make different aliases because after one year, the Gestapo heard about Hans Jacobsen, he was one of the -- what the hell this is -- one of the leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then the -- a man was tortured, and he said that well, he knew Hans Jacobsen, that was his address, and then of course then the Germans went out and they couldn’t find any Hans Jacobsen at all, he had no telephone, he had no address, he had just nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So they -- I was there, and then --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was that your alias at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  Jacobsen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Then I was Hans Jacobsen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  But then when that was known by the Germans, I changed into another name. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And I really started to fake this myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I learned it, and I think I -- I used -- when I had the false papers I had no -- I had made [indecipherable] myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So I believed them, I knew they were correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Was this easy for you to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">To fake yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  Well, no, it wasn’t easy to start with, but for instance, will you -- you will see in one of my passports, one of the worst Gestapos we have ever had was a fellow called Martinsen, he was the head of the Norwegian part of Gestapo, and I today -- even today I can write his signature, because I had the signa -- his signature on one of my passports, and I think I today could write K. A. Martinsen, pol -- chief of police, secret police in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So 1 -- 1 -- that was -- I hadn’t had it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so I had to start from the ke -- beginning, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Tell me something, did you go -- during this period, the beginning period a-as you started in the resistance in -- did you go back to your family and talk to your parents and tell them what you were doing, so the -- that they --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  A that --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- they wouldn’t worry, or they would worry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  That’s an interesting question, because in ’43, January, one man was tortured, and he knew my real name, Gunnar Sonsteby. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I think it was my real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Then they went right up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rjukan</span> and arrested my father as a hostage for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But I talked with him, and I thought this would happen, that was the -- the way they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And we agreed he’d take -- said -- he said to me, “You take your job, Ill take mine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But I knew I had to go on, and he was kept in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> because they couldn’t send him to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because then they couldn’t threaten to shoot him, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They would have -- liked to have in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> so they could shoot him if it was something with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But he survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  So early on, in 1940, or ’41, you spoke to your parents, and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  -- it was clear to them that this was --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And my mother knew -- my mother knew about it too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  And they -- I helped them, they were -- I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , and when all the [indecipherable] were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Then, she took a couple of these [indecipherable] up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rjukan</span> , it was used there as a secret [indecipherable] for the rest of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And your sister, was she involved in the resistance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Very little, because th-then it would have been too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  So, it wasn’t --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You mean it was too much to have two children --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">In the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like that, it wouldn’t do, it had to be other people that took over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So did you get bored with working on the newspaper and wanted to do something more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t get bored, because it was terribly interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But Ih -- then, in °41, I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to report because I don’t -- I didn’t know what about our allies? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">What about our people in -- over the -- overseas, in the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And knew -- I knew they had their <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So I went with one of my refu -- he was a refugee, over to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And then they told me, we can use you as a growing -- as a career between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So I started that. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So I had about 15 - 20 of these trips between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Then I knew a little more what they wanted with us, from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , wh-what the allied wanted, through the Norwegian government and our defense people in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So our -- after awhile, I think it was in °42, ninth of April, ’42, then I was in touch with the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I said, we’re have an organization, I didn’t know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was a S.O.E., special operations executive. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And then they asked me, are you willing to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , put up an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> for us, secret of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So from ninth of April ’40 to ninth of April ’43, I had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , and every fortnight 1t came a courier to me, and I had to report -- make a report, so that had be ready when he came, so I wrote the report every fortnight that year, about conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  Let me ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Prior to that, were you not taken to a refugee camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> in Sweden?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Yes, but --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Or -- of -- of --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- [had the -- I don’t know how I -- it was very se -- very special in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , if you left the camp, you would be arrested, but I was lucky, so I was -- I was wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you would be arrested, but I was lucky, so I was -- I was wanted in Sweden very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> later on, I had to be -- keep in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> very -- I couldn’t go into <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , so -- and I had some Swedes want -- could -- they dared to keep me in their small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , for instance, but when I -- the first time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , I had to stay there three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And then I spent my days going into different small coffee shops, because in daytime I couldn’t go to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I lived, so -- but it was very natural that I was wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because you couldn’t have Norwegian refugees running all around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="BUILDING">coffee shops</span> , because in daytime I couldn’t go to that place where I lived, so -- but it was very natural that I was wanted in Sweden because you couldn’t have Norwegian refugees running all around the country, in a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So it was very natural. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So I was put in -- prisoner for about three months, but then I got out again, under a false name. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I put up a new name, a new family name, and I was put to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and they all believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So then I got out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , and then in secrecy back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> .</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  So he did that [indecipherable] and it came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , and I had the same book, the same page, and I could easily -- we coded only the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">The rest you wrote could be written, but the names were important, and the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  So can you explain the system? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Was it by syllable, or by letter?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  No, no, I had changed many times since that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And it was so strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">If you came up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kongsvinger</span> , and you’re in -- you were controlled, then if you had a passport showing it was made out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , you would be taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So I had to make new passports, which they did for me up there -- would -- and I did -- by the way, I did them s -- myself, but I got a form up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And then I had the passport being issued by the Kongsvinger police. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Then they wouldn’t say, oh gosh, he’s -- he’s living here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Now --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  But if you -- if you had a passport issued by Oslo police, you would be interrogated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Because you were suspicious then. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">You were man outside the -- the -- the German guard in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , of course they had a couple of security police, and they said all strangers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kongsvinger</span> , be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They might be [indecipherable] they might be resistance workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So that’s was a [indecipherable]</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  But of course, if you had some -- some stupid thing could stop it of course, but I was lucky, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I was from February ’43, I was wanted and they had nice pictures of me at the Gestapo headquarters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> in Oslo. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Nice pictures, but wi -- an average looking man like me, I have a nose, I have eyes, and a mouth, ears, that’s -- you cannot pick up a man -- I think you can talk to the police here, it’s impossible to pick up a average looking man from a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I knew it was impossible, I -- and I -- I still, I believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">That made me look just [indecipherable] I walked around in <span class="DLF">Oslo street</span> without trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  We’re going to take a break now.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  That’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Or are you --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s correct [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So tell me how -- why it was that you did not stay with that group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Well, I did, because I followed it all the time, and I -- I mention the name called Knut Moyen. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He and I worked very closely together. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And everything I could do to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Then all the SOE sent in instructors from Great Britain to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , and it was a mixture there, it was a little difficult, because the Norwegian organization did one thing, and the groups from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> to Norway, and it was a mixture there, it was a little difficult, because the Norwegian organization did one thing, and the groups from England did another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It was the Norwegian independent company number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But then, together with Knut Moyen we could discuss this, and I could help him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We were both a little unlucky because one of the people coming from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , he was arrested, he was tortured, and he became more or less an informer. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Of course, this -- he was shot, he got shot right through the head, and [indecipherable] so it was terrible, but we are both a little unlucky there because many, many people, 200 people are arrested because of that instructor who was tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But otherwise, I took care of -- I was asked by my authorities to take care of all people come -- all agents coming in from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , from the -- coming around the central part of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , and I took care of them, that was part my job, so we could discuss this, and in the -- in a couple of years it was all coordinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">It was a little because the [indecipherable] thought I should built up with Norwegians alone, but they finally saw that some of the people inside <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> that built up the resistance, they were clever enough to let us -- so they could cooperate, but you know, you couldn’t talk to each other in that way in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I-I-It was all secret, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Communications with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was difficult, everything was difficult, but in two, three years, it was all coordinated within SOE, and the Norwegian authorities in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and also the home front people, the military central leadership in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , it was all finally coordinated from I would say, 43, it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And we had also a very good leader who was very clever, and th -- he was over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> a couple of times, which I was also, but he really was a good man, and he -- they understood in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> that he was a -- quite a terribly clever fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">He re -- he impressed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">That helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And we had also, of course, Communists, which didn’t agree in that kind of leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But I worked together with them, so when I met the man who fought the Germans, that was the important part, whatever he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">That was the important part for me, so I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Had a good cooperation with them, but legally on top, they would -- they would listen more, of course, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , than -- instead of to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But they were not under <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , but to a certain extent they listened more to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , which 1s -- was natural, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But it -- it worked fairly well in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  About 2,000 in all to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And it was -- could have been a few Jews coming from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to come to that safe <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And like Willie Brandt, for instance, and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I know, of course, many Jews came, very famous Jews, doctors and musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But then the -- in °42, it -- the first thing that started -- you saw my passport, they put a J there. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Of course that was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We didn’t understand it, how they could do it, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , one was a Methodist, another was a Baptist and another was a Jew, we didn’t think of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Now they tried to make us -- a kind of propaganda against Jews, but it didn’t work, it -- not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It didn’t work in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">We hadn’t had that impression at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So then it started a little more, and the trouble was, now when I think back, y-you know that far -- that far -- all the -- all the ar-archives, you know, all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They found that in [indecipherable] and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Well, how could you help it, in a way, but then was when the trouble started, you know?

<p>QUESTION:  So, did the resistance warn Jews and say, things may happen, we want to take you out of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , or did the Jews make contact with the resistance to ask for help?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">ANSWER:  No, I just -- for instance, we had a family, which I talked about, we discussed that openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">When I -- we had a -- a career, he -- they knew him very well, so they heard from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , they had news from the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So they -- they heard about the Crystal Night, you know, all that, so now they started to think, maybe it can happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And about the 1200, they have started to think that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But I talked to Jule Benko my friend that is here with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He 1s one of - in our <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> he was the speaker of our [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> for 12 years, and we discussed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He was a young Jew at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">He was in resistance, ’42, so we discussed between ourselves now, we are discussed 1t now, what did you think -- what did I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We had the same view on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We had just thought the same in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So he -- then Gestapo was -- had wanted him, so he went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , of course, because we had to flee, because he was now wanted by the Gestapo, then you had to flee. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And he --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So what -- what was your view, that it was so alike at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  That was that we didn’t -- we couldn’t believe that they would be arrested, or -- or w-we could believe that they would be arrested to a camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , but the rest we didn’t at all consider. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And he went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and later on he came over to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and joined the Norwegian Air Force, and all his family are lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">All of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So he knows what happened.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">QUESTION:  “Well,” he said, “he can stand by the <span class="DLF">window</span> and be pretending that he’s cleaning the <span class="DLF">window</span> and he loses the little cloth piece, and then I can take it out, I'll put the pill in there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">They did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So it worked, but some Germans had seen it, but the -- they couldn’t prove it, so the cook was a very good cook, so they said, well, forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">But my friend got a pill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">When he understood that we had given up all hope, he then thought to himself, now I try to flee from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And he really almost made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">He came to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and the -- jumped over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , he had come all the way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Then a German soldier -- by the way it wa -- he was an under -- he was a [indecipherable] or something, and he took his rifle and shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">So, it was very sad, but he had made it, but it was a very -- an ordinary thing, a -- a soldier wouldn’t do that, but this time he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So it was very un -- unhappy thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">He was -- we were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">That could be, of course, several -- actually we had also when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , two of my best men, they wanted to do some anti-propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">It was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> what they called the anti-propaganda school, it’s another English name for it, but they did some of that in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , trying to make the Germans believe that it was a secret opposition between German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">I tried to pretend that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">It was -- and then they got hold of, from one of the <span class="REGION">districts</span> , the Milorg had taken to -- had hid two German soldiers, but their -- they pretended to be -- didn’t want to do any more, they were getting out of the army, trying to get over to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , they pretended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And my friends, they believed in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And when I met these two guys, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , the Gestapo was there, and they were Gestapo people, so they were both shot, shot in the -- in a restaur -- in a <span class="BUILDING">café</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So there’s one le -- one died immediately, and the other one, Taloxen, he survived, but very -- hardly wounded, but then he was taken to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> first and then to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and then he -- he hanged himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">He -- he knew he couldn’t take it, he knew he would give in, give up some names, so he didn’t want to take the chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when I heard this through the -- we had the wireless operators, they wired it over to me, so I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">So then I had to pick up new people, two new people to take them back to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">That happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Tell me, did -- did the agents, other than you, who had hundreds of names in your head, did most of the agents only have a few names --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, usually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">QUESTION:  -- because they would give -- oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">ANSWER:  They were not in my position, they were just coming in from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , doing their jobs, and back again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1111">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">ANSWER:  So that was a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">But they had names, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">They could say, how did you come to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">ANSWER:  Well, we came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">QUESTION:  <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ship</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Ship</span> , okay, that was [indecipherable] but who helped you when you came ashore? </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">What was his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Was it [indecipherable] who could it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">That was very dangerous, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">So they knew enough names to make trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">QUESTION:  Did a lot of agents use aliases and keep changing their names, so -- so that --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, they ha -- they were given a name in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , before they left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">ANSWER:  So that was another thing, I -- I had to send over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , I had to send different forms for different passports, that was also a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And they were very well done in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but if you had taken a name, and that man had been a policeman in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , then he would be shifted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">If you came after two years, then suddenly -- and those names hadn’t been checked, one of the groups came right into [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">He was [indecipherable] by a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">It was a new man, and it was a -- a small shopkeeper that they also could use. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">He was a Nazi at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">So all na -- everything, all information had to be very up to date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So that was always -- when they made out the forms, passports in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , it would -- could be a little more chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I didn’t have that chance in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So our papers, they were more dependable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1134">QUESTION:  Let me ask you another question about sort of your everyday life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Where were you eating? </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Where did you eat lunch, where did you eat dinner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">ANSWER:  Tha-That’s a ver-very interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">When I stay at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I didn’t want to be seen in daytime, so I usually went out in the morning, well, say nine o’clock, then I didn’t come back until 10 - 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1139">QUESTION:  At night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Because I didn’t want to go in and out from that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So then I had my luncheon for instance, down at the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I had my dinner with a -- an old lady, a widow, where I could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I -- but then when night came I always went back to my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , and I knew it had to be shifted in, for instance, three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Then the people could have seen me, and it was some -- after the war, some of the members of the Nazi party, they said, we didn’t do anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">No, but when they saw a man going in, out -- for instance with a rucksack every night, they reported it, and they had to report it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">If you were a member of the party you had to report it, and that could be disastrous for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Well, they didn’t understand it, and you can explain it to them, but that’s the way of a traitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Sometimes they are forced when they are in the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">That was the same in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">When you were in the party, you were forced to be -- more or less to be a -- an informer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">We had the same in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">QUESTION:  And what were you doing from early morning until 10 o’clock at night? </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">Were you actually going someplace to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER:  Oh -- meeting people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1156">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">ANSWER:  All day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And we -- a couple of times my second in command, we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which we used in the day, in the daytime, [indecipherable] so we could sit down, have coffee and sit and talk and do our passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">We had a small -- we had a small <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , which we had hired, so we have spent some time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And then when we had -- were -- had a sabotage job done, we also -- they used, very often -- the night, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Sometimes it was daylight when we did our operations, but some -- usually nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And then the -- the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I lived in for about a year, then the -- the lady there, she understood because whenever it was some noise in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I had been away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So she said to me after the war that she thought that I maybe have carried -- carried the -- the -- the case for -- or the rucksack for the saboteur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">She thought I had been a helper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  Helper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">ANSWER:  But she never believed that I was the man, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">So it -- if -- she did never think that I was able to do any sabotage operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So I was an ordinary man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">QUESTION:  Tell me about your conversations when you would sit with your -- with your colleagues. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Were they practical conversations, were they political conversations, a combination?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">ANSWER:  Well, it was very often not so -- I would say funny things, we were joking very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">We had the -- the humor, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And all kinds of jokes were very popular and for instance, when I should meet with the whole group of let’s say six, seven, altogether, then we usually met at one of the big <span class="DLF">graveyards</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">There was no money -- n-no people there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And that could be a very good way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">It’s -- for instance, we never met in <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">We didn’t never meet in <span class="BUILDING">cafés</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">It was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">We met in the open, and I can’t recall that the whole group ever met in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Would be disastrous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">So sometimes then, communication between us could be difficult, because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And that could -- could easily be some misunderstandings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">So when we had one operation, we -- the first time the man that should help us, he had -- he had overslept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">So he didn’t show up, and we couldn't go because he had the fuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Next time, he forgot the fuse, so we -- I was very angry with him, I’ve never been so angry in my life, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So, things like that could happen [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">But was -- then made it more -- more simple, more so the nerves could help out with -- they would have -- some had difficulties with their nerves, of course, but I had the -- we had about 15 operations in ’44, and then one of the fellows, he said, well, he s -- what will happen here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Can we come into trouble and get shot, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Then one other fellow said, no, 24 is with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I had had so much luck, every time, and th-they were all -- we had no -- no -- then, 15 successful operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">So in a way, it was dangerous to think that way, but I had the luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1192">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">So how would you communicate when you were going to do an operation, or you had a task that someone should do --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">QUESTION:  -- how would you get the word out so that people would know to meet you in [indecipherable |</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, that’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Telephones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1197">ANSWER:  Telephones were not tapped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I think the reason why they couldn’t tap all telephones, they had the -- the -- Germans had the technicians, they had it, but they were dependent on Norwegian, on Norwegian technicians, all over you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They call all -- these telephone boxes were different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I don’t think they found any technician that was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">So they didn’t think of it, and they had thought they should do it, but they never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So you could use the telephone, but of course you wouldn’t say, now we are going to have sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">You didn’t say that, but you say, we have to fetch the milk, or we meet in a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> because I got any more bread, or maybe a little goat cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">That’s Norwegian usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">So, telephone was very much used. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Then, that day, they were [indecipherable] then we met, and I had all the information, all the intelligence, because I had been round there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I -- I could be always in the open, I was there [indecipherable] it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">So what important in any military operation 1s intelligence before, and -- and intelligence very often can be wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">But I could go there and see with my own eyes that it -- it was like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So that was a ve-very important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1211">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1212">ANSWER:  But made out on the telephone, very often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1213">QUESTION:  Let me go back to January 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">The -- apparently the -- the Gestapo was hunting for you, and you -- there was an incident when you came back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in which you were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Could you describe that incident?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  Yes, how -- how would I know that I was wanted? </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">For -- when they had the -- when that fellow had given up my name, real name, I didn’t know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">So I had, at that time, about seven different <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I had -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so I could use several -- several around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And then at one of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> I had a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I had hired, or my friend, as a matter of fact, in -- small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the gas station, you know, slow -- very near the -- the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the police, and -- and then the -- I didn’t know a thing, I came in from -- I’d been in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> <span class="BUILDING">gas station</span> , you know, slow -- very near the -- the headquarters of the police, and -- and then the -- I didn’t know a thing, I came in from -- I’d been in the woods, I think had the little weekend, which I had in the middle of the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">So I came in, it was dark, and then when I came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I thought -- everything had to be blinded at that time, every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , everything that no light should come out because of air raids, so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So -- but I thought it wasn’t well done in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I felt something must be wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">So I didn’t put the key in the <span class="DLF">door</span> , then I would just be shot, because there was some people waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And I r-read about this afterwards, because Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he wrote the report about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And he was very, very angry with the people sitting there, because I dis -- I just -- they didn’t catch me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I -- I rang the bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Then I would -- knew I would have a split second to think what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And the -- the <span class="DLF">door</span> was thrown open -- open immediately and I -- there was a -- I got a pistol right in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And the -- h-he asked me to come in, and I said, to hell I don’t want to come in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And I saw two Germans, in -- gendarmes wer -- they were, and with gun -- with rifles, and then he -- I tried to get my pistol, but then he -- that pistol was right in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">So I just -- when he yell at me to come in, I said to hell I want to, and I hit the pistol, and the -- he -- the shot went in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and then the -- I jumped out in the dark, and the two Germans shot, they all missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">So then the -- I knew it was people there, that -- I knew it was people that didn’t like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">So then I went to the second, it was only a hundred yards away, my second <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Then started shooting there, then I got away there, and then the -- my es -- taxi driver who drove me at that time, he said -- he said, “T-I don’t think you should go to any of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I said, “I have to see at least one more, then I know they are sitting everywhere, but I have to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And when I came down to that flat, they had put a safety chain <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , so I was warned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">So I got away there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">But then he -- my -- my taxi driver ans -- he said, no, no, no, please no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">So I then found an -- a new -- brand new <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and had a good night’s sleep, no trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So -- but that -- that night, many, many people are arrested, because it was [indecipherable] all over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">QUESTION:  Why wasn’t two times enough for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Why did you have to try the third?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1245">ANSWER:  Well, I had to know, are they sitting everywhere? </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">What about the rest of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">QUESTION:  And -- uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I tho -- I had thought so, I had to be safe, that they were sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Then I was pretty sure they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And this guards, they were -- got into very big trouble in front of the Gestapo chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">They really got <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , because they had the --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Because they missed you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">And h-he said in his report, the worst thing isn’t that they missed him, but they didn’t report to me, so I lost -- I lost the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">If they had reported immediately, we could have gone to some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and got him, but they didn’t dare to tell me that they had lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1256">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1257">ANSWER:  So it was a good thing [indecipherable] frightened by the Gestapo chief, and they got <span class="NPIP">hell</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1258">QUESTION:  So tell me a couple of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">How did you find a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> that night? </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">You had seven beautiful --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, I knew -- I knew about the merchant -- haberdasher, by the way, and I knew he was good -- or a good man, so I went up to his <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I said I wanted to -- I was welcomed immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">So you would all -- in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like ours, we know all -- most people, anti-Nazis, you would be supported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">But it was also a chance that they could have been all of -- arrested before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">You could go right into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">But you had the -- you needed luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1265">QUESTION:  Was this a circumstance where you dropped a book? </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Your diary, or am I wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I -- I lost that in that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and -- but I s -- I knew I had put na -- two names on that notebook, so I put on some other clothes and after half an hour I went back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I knew they wouldn’t start over again, lost -- they lost track of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">So I Just went right in -- almost <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Two days later, they -- it -- you had to try to think rationally, to say, why -- why should I keep staying there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I had disappeared, why should I -- well, then you could be safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">QUESTION:  Did they chase you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1381">QUESTION:  How does one make a decision as to who will assassinate the informer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1382">ANSWER:  Well, if he hadn’t been taken that evening, it had been too late, next morning it would -- he would report to Fehmer and he would say maybe and maybe could come with some tracks, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1383">QUESTION:  No, what I mean is how do you decide who’s going to kill him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1384">ANSWER:  Oh well, that was a --</p>

<p>ANSWER:  -- oh, it had to be one of the -- they were disciplined, they had -- they knew what it cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">So one of the group would get that order.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1577">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1578">ANSWER:  So it meant very much for the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">You could use a telephone all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">So it spread.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1584">ANSWER:  And they were disappearing, hitting, ruining for them, and disappeared, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">So of course it was -- was not very nice for the Gestapo, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">They got into trouble.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Mr. Sonsteby, before we go on and talk about some other sabotage operations, let’s get a picture of how many Germans there are to every Norwegian in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1589">ANSWER:  We were, at that time, three million people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">And we had in from ’42 - ’43, we had about 250,000, later on more than 300,000 troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">It was 10 percent of all the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">And if you take the age of -- the military age, which was an important 17 - 18 to 32 - 34, then it was -- in <span class="REGION">southern Norway</span> it was about three Germans to a Norwegian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">And in <span class="REGION">north Norway</span> , very little -- it was not so many people, we had -- it could be about 10 Germans to a Norwegian in that age group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">So [indecipherable] swarmed in [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So when you were walking around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> during your daily meetings --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1595">QUESTION:  -- did you always see a lot of troops?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1596">ANSWER:  Oh yes, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">But I didn’t care, I thought that they didn’t touch me, and I didn’t touch them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">So, just like that, especially you were always -- all the controls, you know, and when you consider Norwegians, they were being traitors, they had the -- some of them had the control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">They were one man with a machine pistol, and it was five others, youngsters, Nazi boys with rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">And then you were stopped, they looked in your pockets and in your -- your vest -- what do you call these small things you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">Suitcases, and briefcases and looked through them, opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">And if you saw them, and you tried to get away, and you didn’t stop, you would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">They shot immediately these youngsters, young Norwegians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">That was very bad to see, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">And they were Nazis and they didn't understand what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">So it could even be on the [indecipherable] gosh that man -- if you then just moved another, they would stop you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">And if you didn’t stop immediately, got shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1608">QUESTION:  A -- A few weeks after you bombed the <span class="BUILDING">Labor Office</span> , you were supposed to blow up an <span class="BUILDING">insurance company building</span> , why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1609">ANSWER:  Well, they used some kind of a -- 1n order to call in people, they had to use what you call -- I won’t -- I don’t know what you call it in English, but all the insurance companies had -- is a kind of starting up of data system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">They could sort out things on new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">And it was, of course, the company that had this, that was IBM. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">At that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , it had another name, the company, and they had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">And these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> were now put in to sort out people to find the addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">They were sorted like anything 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">It was a first kind of data -- data machine, I think, data. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">And then the Germans and the Norwegian -- the Nazi government, they wanted to use this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">I got the order to take it, to destroy it before they could start. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">So the first- the machines, they were -- they were in a nice <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , and one morning we heard that it - they will be taken over by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">So the day before, we came there, and we had a big stone through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and had three small charges of -- of explosives, and there were no more after a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">Then we disappeared completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">The next day they -- we had forgotten a big machine up in the <span class="BUILDING">insurance company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">And then we had got the new order to go up there and take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">And then they had put four guards around the machine with a police dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">Now they were sure it will not be taken, and the Gestapo and the -- they were hundred percent sure nobody could come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">So it was impossible, but we found a new way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">If it had been now we would have maybe used a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span> , but you didn’t have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span> at that time, so we had to crawl over three, four <span class="DLF">roofs</span> , until we reached that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and got down there, and the -- there we knew it was -- the machine was under the -- the dining room, or the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , or the room where the fella -- the employees had their meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">And during the night we came, we reached it, and put the explosive, that would 10 -- it was a delayed bomb, 10 minutes, and then we went back, we -- if you then went into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> about 10:30, you would be taken, it was German guard all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">Also because of these sabotage operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">If we came into the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we would be arrested immediately, our age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">So we wen-went into the next <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and had a fine view to where the explosion will go off and 10 minutes afterwards, again we -- we didn’t want to take lives, so we called them again on the telephone, we said, two minutes, you’d better get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">And they knew from experience now, so they all got out, even with the dog, and then it was blown up, the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">And next morning they couldn’t find anybody, no track whatsoever, which was a very important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">We didn’t lose people, I didn’t lose any of my men, and it was a -- should called a success.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1634">QUESTION:  You must have driven them crazy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1635">ANSWER:  I think it was not so easy to bear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">Not to find a track, 1t was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">And of course it meant that the people also, they didn’t talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">They knew they had -- shouldn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">Of course it was wonderful for them to hear about it, and when I came the next day, I went down in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> and talked to people and they said, oh, terrible people that’s done this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">So -- but it was very popular, of course, within the population because they knew it was a fight towards the Gestapo first of all, and to stop this conscription of our young persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">So in -- in the course of "44 summer, autumn, it was all stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">They gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">And another thing, politically, Germans sometimes found that these Norwegian Nazis weren't always so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">So they were -- they were now annoyed that they didn’t make it and put [indecipherable] Gestapo in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">So they were - it could be a little -- for us it was very important that it was a g -- not good relations between the Germans and the Nazi Norwegians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">That could also be a point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1647">QUESTION:  Now, I guess it was about a month later, in the <span class="BUILDING">Lysaker factory</span> , there -- you -- you blew up, was June 28", 1944, there was another bombing that you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">Was it following that that the Nazis retaliated in terms of the ration cards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1649">ANSWER:  Yes, every Norwegian over 16 years old had to have a ration card. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">And then these youngsters, they were all -- they were all refused to fetch the cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">And then we -- I was asked to steal a few, to real -- make it a hold-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1652">QUESTION:  Now wait a minute, wait a minute, ex -- go back a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1653">ANSWER:  Yes --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What were -- what were the Nazis doing with the cards that if you --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  They refused to give the cards to -- to the youngsters of 18 - 19 - 20 - 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1654">QUESTION:  Because they wanted to conscript them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1655">ANSWER:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1656">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1657">ANSWER:  Then they would have to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">If they didn’t get a card, they had to report, that was the way.\</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1659">ANSWER:  And then I was asked to -- to put up a hold up, to take over 75,000 ration -- ration cards, and that was one and a half ton. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">So it was not a pocket theft, 1t was a real [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">So we -- it was coming out from the printing shop with guards, the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span> with guards, the whole truck, and we stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">In <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> y-you have a han -- it’s right driving you know, we have left and right, <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">And then you can stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">My <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came and stopped the other one, because it had stopped because of the right of way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">So then we -- I took over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">I just opened the front door of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and said, let me have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="DLF">front door</span> of the truck and said, let me have a place here, I don’t want to sit here in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">So I put my gun in the side of the watchman, of the guard, and he moved immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">And at the same time, two of my friends went up on the -- on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , where it was two other guards, so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">We took it over, the whole thing, with the one and a half ton of ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">That was -- then we met another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , which I didn’t know the number plates, I didn’t know anything, I knew exact at 9:30 we will meet another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , I stopped there, and 1 -- all ration card got taken over to the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and that disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">If we were now arrested or taken, we didn’t know where to find the cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">They could have tortured us, but we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">That was also important at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1675">ANSWER:  Then the -- some of our leaders, they had a telephone to the authorities, one <span class="DLF">way line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">And the-they told the authorities, now we have -- we have the cards, we want to make a deal with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">And they say, what’s your -- what’s your address? </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">Well, we haven’t got any address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">What’s your telephone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">We haven’t got any telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">But we want you to give a new order that the youngsters should have the cards -- have their ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">And th -- how -- why did they give in? </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">Yes, they gave in because at this time, Germans were building up that most important <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">That’s the strongest <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> from this time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">So if it had been an invasion, had been terrible to take back <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">Would have cost millions, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">And then we said, we are going to send these cards all over, sell them to make the black market way and it will ruin your situation, the whole <span class="BUILDING">station</span> <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> way and it will ruin your situation, the whole station here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">What about people working on your <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> , and all that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">They would have no -- no food, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">It would be terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">It would ruin the whole situation here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">And then the Nazi government, Norwegian, they had to give in, because the Germans would be furious if their laborers, all those, didn’t get any food at all, it will stop all work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">So they gave in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">We had won. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">That was in September ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">They tried once more to conscript the lady -- the women, but that didn’t work at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">So we didn't hear any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">And our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , without address, without telephones, just disappeared from the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1699">QUESTION:  And then once they agreed, you gave back the cards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1700">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">Of course, this was done by another group, but I worked closely with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">I didn’t do that part of it, but my part was to get hold of the cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1703">QUESTION:  But that giving back process could also be dangerous because they could then catch the group</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh yes, that -- you are quite right, but the way we did it, well we just gave them first 20,000 cards and then they -- we said, you can pick them up <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , for instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1704">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1705">ANSWER:  And then part of it we put in small parcels, and on top of them we wrote, dangerous explosives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">And it was put round in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> and it was a hell of a trouble for the police, the Nazi police, and they didn’t dare to touch them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">So they sent for a company <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , an -- German specialists to -- on the -- to take over, and then they opened it very carefully, and it was ration -- ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">So we had a little fun also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">But of course we were -- man -- many people into this, and -- but it was all coordinated very well from the top.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1710">QUESTION:  Now, ins -- in August of 1944, there was a bombing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korzewall</span> , with the airplane parts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1711">ANSWER:  Yes, that was an important <span class="NPIP">place</span> , 1t was very hard to find because the German camouflaged it with a very big [indecipherable] very big, you know, the biggest in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">And half of it was put into stock of all kinds of spec-special re-repair parts for -- for fighter planes, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Messerschmitt</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter planes</span> , Messerschmitt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">And they had also a-about -- about 20 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fuselage</span> that was there, to put -- put up to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> later on, and we got to know it, and it was very hard to know where it was and what they did, but we had to get intelligence, and one of my friends, he got to know all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">So then we went in there, and the part -- the Norwegian part was no guarded, strangely enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">Was one guard, which I by the way took -- had -- took hold of when we came there in the night and pacified him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">And then we went in there and then went into the German part in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , through three <span class="DLF">fences</span> , and put down about 300 pounds of dynamite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">We blew up the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">And I think it wasn’t very nice for them to use their spare parts in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">And the same had to be done with ball bearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">Ball bearing was terribly important for any nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">And Swedish -- <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> had the best ball bearings in the world, you know, they had also a small place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , which was also blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">Another thing what -- how -- how would we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1723"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Submarines</span> use batteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">Submarines batteries, that means sulfur, the acid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">And we had two of them in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , so the way we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> was to ruin these two <span class="BUILDING">acid factories</span> , and they were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">So they couldn’t produce any more, they were ruined for the rest of the war, and then it was not -- very few batteries coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> to -- norw -- to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , because at the <span class="DLF">coastline</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , during the war you could hide every nation’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fleet</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> and everything, in Norwegian fjords. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">You could have the whole -- the world could be placed into Norwegian fjords. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">And they did, of course, all those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , they disappeared in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Norwegian fjords</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">So they were -- it was very important to hit them in a way of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">Then you had to have experts to help you [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">But when we talked about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haugland</span> , he was also wireless operator on the heavy water operation, and on my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">And so he had a [indecipherable] experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">Two s-s-small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- two small town boys were also there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1734">QUESTION:  You said you pacified the guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">Is that another word for killing him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1736">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1737">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1738">ANSWER:  Just to hold him up, and just keep watching him, or one man had to watch him all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">But the trouble with that, of course, if he doesn’t start screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">And people maybe done that, without helping it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1741">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1742">ANSWER:  So that could be a -- then, when you hear about guards being -- you can shoot him, because of the noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">So when you hear about that, it’s a -- a necessity, because they can give a noise, scream or something like that, but he -- luckily he didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">So he was a -- sent out --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1745">ANSWER:  Afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">So we tried to be very careful with the civilian at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">It was not our -- we were no terrorists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">The Germans called us, of course, terrorists, but I -- I -- I don’t know any type or [indecipherable] which was terrorism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1749">QUESTION:  And in that operation at the <span class="DLF">air</span> -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korzewall</span> , there were cleaning women who used [indecipherable |</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, that was another difficult thing, of course, when you come into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that, if you had -- if you had the cleaning womens and I had pacify them in a way that -- I said that we were now -- you know, on all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , you have different advertising, and I said I was a painter, so I should paint some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> with the -- and they believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">I -- I looked very innocent, and they said, he’s a nice painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">So then I -- then I -- when I saw all the explosives being carried in, I said, this is meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">So this is -- go to your -- your people in the -- with all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> [indecipherable] it will be fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">So they believed me, but when they talked, and -- but then I had to tell them, I’m very sorry, but it -- now it will be blown up, you come with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">So -- but they could stop the whole operation, you know, if they had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">So that was not a way to be innocent, try to make people believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1756">QUESTION:  And what was their response when you said to them, essentially, I was lying to you, it’s now going to be blown up, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">Were they angry at you, were they frightened of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1758">ANSWER:  Oh no, they were frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1759">QUESTION:  They were frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1760">ANSWER:  Like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , of course, which is understandable, under -- but they got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">They couldn't -- nobody hurt them afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1762">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1763">ANSWER:  They couldn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">But people, when they see and hear about explosions, you know, fuses burning, it’s very understandable that they are frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1765">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1766">ANSWER:  It’s -- it’s a good thing, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1767">QUESTION:  Were you with Haugland at the heavy water operation, or no --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1768">QUESTION:  -- was he alone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">I mean, was --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I was then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , and they were trained in -- specially on that target in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , by some Norwegian professors that had really installed the heavy water plant at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rjukan</span> <span class="BUILDING">heavy water plant</span> at Rjukan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">It’s part of the electr -- electrolyses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">That’s part of it, you get the heavy water from the --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1784">ANSWER:  Yeah, that was, of course, also necessary because -- especially the special oils for -- could be lubricating oils, which was very important, very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">You know, the Germans, they really, in the last <span class="NPIP">part</span> , they had no lubricating oil, they had no gasoline, it was just -- some part of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Panzer</span> , you know, couldn’t work because they hadn’t any more -- so that, it was very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">So to ruin any gasoline <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , or lubricating, was very important, that was part of how you could hit the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">But as I said before, the real effort in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> ’s war was the sailors and the -- or that was the real thing, but so -- but everything you could do against the occupying powers in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> would, of course help -- help out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1788">QUESTION:  So you destroyed about 50,000 gallons of oil in that operation, am I right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1789">ANSWER:  Well, it could be, but it was more from the small groups, they did many, all over <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1790">QUESTION:  On that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1791">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1792">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1793">ANSWER:  Not -- not on that day, but [indecipherable] occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1794">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1795">ANSWER:  That was done by several groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">So I -- I don’t know how much it would be, enormous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">It was ruined, especially all the stocks in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1798">QUESTION:  Now why did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> in November of 1944? </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">You went back to be more highly trained than you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1800">ANSWER:  Ah -- yeah, I wanted to report now in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">So I -- then I went over with a n -- third name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">My name was this time Harald Sorensen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I had good papers, when I came to the security police -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> you can think in a wartime, security police, and I got in now a-at the thi -- in the third, after third name, Harald Sorensen, electrical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">So then it was a very few people that, of course -- in there, so we [indecipherable] that I was let in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">Could be a dangerous [indecipherable], I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1806">QUESTION:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">So you took a cour -- an STS 17 course, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1808">ANSWER:  Yeah, that means -- no, I didn’t, I -- I went up there because my course that had been before, so I just reported over there, to -- to try what happened, what about the experience did I have, with the things I had learned in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">So that was a special course in sabotage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1810">QUESTION:  Now at -- during that period of time when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , you met with the crown prince, and the king?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1811">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1812">QUESTION:  That the case?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1813">ANSWER:  Because --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And what was that meeting about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1814">ANSWER:  The sa -- the king heard about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and of course he had not been in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> for four winters now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">And when he heard that I was there for the -- number 24, he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">And then he asked me to come up to there to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">Of course, it was very nice to meet them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">And then the king said to me, “What’s your name today, Erling Fjyeld?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">They laughed a little, you see, and then I said, “Now today, your majesty, my name is Harald Sorensen, electrical engineer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">And he- | -- if I had invite him to go back to the resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , he may have followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">But he was a tall man, so it would be really strange if you had seen the Norwegian king up and down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1822">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1823">ANSWER:  But he -- he had really en-enjoy this, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">But on the other hand, if -- when we talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> and all, he was nearly crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">It was very serious to him, but he couldn’t go back, and then -- but then after six months, in June ’45, he could go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1826">QUESTION:  What was that like for you to sit with the king of your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">Was that extraordinary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1828">ANSWER:  Oh, very, very special, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">So I then didn’t realize it, I think, because all things were quite serious, so -- but it -- it was -- 1t was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1830">QUESTION:  Was the crown prince there as well, during that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1831">ANSWER:  Not at that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1832">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1833">ANSWER:  The other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">I met him with the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">Then he was commander in chief for all forces --</p>

<p>ANSWER:  Oh, it -- it was harder, and the Gestapo was very hard, it was -- it was terribly hard, terribly tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">Many, many people are shot, many people are put in concentration camps and now we heard more than rumors what happened to them in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and now we heard more than rumors what happened to them in Germany, but not exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">We knew it was tough, but even in December we didn’t realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">It wasn’t realized before the Americans came to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">So we -- we couldn’t believe it, and in, of course, summer, it was not easy because they knew I was one of their leaders, and I very often got telephones, have you heard from my s-son, have you -- have you -- my father, and -- and the -- it was about 10,000, you know, that’s -- for a nation of three millions, it’s quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">But it couldn’t -- some people -- some <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> -- in Europe was worse, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1848">QUESTION:  Am -- am I correct that one of your last sabotage operations was March 1945, you call it the Operation Cement Mixer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1849">ANSWER:  Yes, because the Germans really had a counterattack in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ardennes</span> [indecipherable] that often [indecipherable] it was called on, it was really tough, because it cost the allied -- I think one <span class="NPIP">place</span> you lost 75,000 Americans in that [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">And lots of people, and then this will be reinforced by troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">We had -- Hitler had fresh troops in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">And he -- they had some of the troops that had left <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> -- you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> turned around and kicked the German out, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">They came over to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , all of them, so it was some of the best armies in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , still, and now they shipped them down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> , and shipped them over to -- soon as possible to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to reinforce this offensive -- the [indecipherable] that offensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">But then the order came out that try to ruin -- stop the <span class="DLF">railways</span> , north - south going railways, try to sabotage it, try to derail <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">And then the [indecipherable] all the repair thing was done by -- by as -- the central office in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> <span class="BUILDING">central office</span> in Oslo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">To repair the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> , there were all the people there, so then I was asked to blow up the whole <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">So it would ruin their effort to repair and build it up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">And that was done, blown up, completely destroyed, all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">And then the [indecipherable] the gar -- it was guarded usually very well, it was about six, 10 guards there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">One man was sitting behind a <span class="DLF">glass door</span> , but we got -- we got hold of him, and -- but he s -- started shouting, as I told you before, so I -- so we had to -- I was going to take him out -- outwards, but he shouted, tried to -- to warn the rest of the guard, but he -- then you had to -- of course, to shoot him, and the guards, you couldn’t think of those guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">They had th- but they were our enemies, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">We hadn’t invited them to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">So they say that we stopped about -- it was four divisions trying to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I think, I’m not sure historically that we stopped about two and a half division coming to reinforcement in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1864">QUESTION:  And around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they were blowing up railroad tracks and <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and offices --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1865">QUESTION:  All over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1866">ANSWER:  Yeah, all over, especially a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> where railways were, so they derailed and all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1867">QUESTION:  And I guess timing here was very --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, it’s true --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- significant, because whe -- of where the w -- the allies were coming, so they can more quickly stop --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- and there was no chance to rebuild.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1868">ANSWER:  And of course, the Germans, they came as a shock to the Germans because it was all done eight o’clock in the evening, 14" March 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">And by the way, on my father’s birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">So I -- it was a good gift, when he was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , it was a good gift to give.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1871">QUESTION:  And did he find out about it while he was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1872">ANSWER:  No --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1873">ANSWER:  -- 1 -- I doubt it, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">He may have, a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">Rumors were going all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1876">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1877">ANSWER:  SO --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  The war ends May eighth, but on March sixth, the Oslo detachment or gang, and Milorg, go and get the archives, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">Two days before the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1879">ANSWER:  Yes, and then I was again, because a -- it -- German Gestapo and a Norwegian Nazis, that are burning all archives, started wi -- two, three days before the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> was taken over, and then- then we got the -- the order -- 1t was a order, we were under orders from the -- I got the order to try to -- try to st -- not to stop it, but to get hold of the archives, before they burnt them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">We were lucky, we went to the police department, and to the justice department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">And we had some secret agents there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">They picked up the most important and we took it all out on a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , four days before the -- Eisenhower said it’s over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">So it -- 1t meant quite a lot when we -- we had the names, all the Gestapos, we had the names of the -- many of the traitors, otherwise, they had been burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">So they are still the archives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1885">QUESTION:  Are they in the <span class="BUILDING">resistance museum</span> , or are they --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, they are taken over by the National Archives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">We have some very specially deep in the -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> .</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Sorensen didn’t get a rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1898">ANSWER:  No, sor --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Nordstrom didn’t get --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">So then the -- Haugland said okay [indecipherable] my friend, the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">Said, well I think you’re -- you’re a captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">And then the -- afterwards the military off -- authorities, they had to find out what -- this Sonsteby has never been here in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , never been in this company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">So -- but, of course that was -- the result was that I was given that rank, but it had to come six months later, because they had to find my name, they had to do it all properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">So I kept the title.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1904">QUESTION:  So tell me, there are 40,000 men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milorg</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1940">ANSWER:  Yes, first of all, when the Crown Prince came, we had another friend called Max Manus, which I thought was a little quicker than me, because I could be maybe -- he -- he was like a -- like a good horse, he was -- so I thought that -- we were so afraid there were hand grenade landing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , because the Germans were all around, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And the crown prince wanted to come back in an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , right, he didn’t want to have the closed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1941">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah, and I had the discussion with him, but he -- just did -- didn’t -- only wanted an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but he sat on the top there, on the -- so he just didn’t care, but the fellow I had -- th-the chauffeur and Max Manus [indecipherable] they were both there, and the boys around him, so we knew we could stop it, hope so.</span></p>
