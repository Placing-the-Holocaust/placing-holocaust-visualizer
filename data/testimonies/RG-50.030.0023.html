<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Kate Bernath.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were you born and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born August 27, 1927 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szikszo</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family and and your life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szikszo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Uh, I come from a family of three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I had two brothers and I was the youngest, a girl, and my father was a businessman and we were sort of middle-class Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and, uh, I look back on my childhood as quite happy and, uh, even though there were a lot of dark clouds on the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , we children were always protected and and, uh, shielded sort of and, uh, had quite a happy life. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I, we thought so anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Until the... it really began to get bad and we started to hear all the the different rumors about, uh, what's happening all around us but we thought that maybe some people are exaggerating it and, uh, it would never happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We are loyal Hungarian citizens and, uh, nobody would harm us. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Our father, grandfathers fought for the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and, uh, and, uh, it's really just scaring us with these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But then in, uh, April, March actually, 1944, when the Germans came in, we had to put on the yellow star and Jews were not allowed to leave leave their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> actually and, uh, we were not allowed to travel, have <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> or go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I mean we knew that it is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And, uh, within a few weeks we were all rounded up and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in, uh, the nearest bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassa'</span> where we were in, uh, very bad circumstances already. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">No money was allowed to brought with, only certain amount and we had to leave all our possessions at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Just everybody was allowed, uh, uh, backpack of some little clothes and and no food and no money and then we didn't, no, no future. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Didn't know what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">As and surely enough, uh, we were, uh, there four weeks maybe in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when the Germans took us out from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Before we get to that, were you seeing a young man in the middle of all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I, I was, uh, quite, uh, popular (laughter) and, and, uh, seeing we were ri...as I said we had a very social life and, and, and very happy life in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">When we were not, we ' KoSice, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">https://collections.ushmm.org couldn't go to, we couldn't go to, uh, the movies so we entertained ourselves at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I mean we tried to make the best of a bad situation and, uh, this certain young man was, uh, more attentive than others and (laughter) we sort of became semi-officially engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh, he had to go off to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> , but, uh, we promised each other that if we both come back, we going to get married someday. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But that was, uh, a very iffy situation of course because you really didn't know what was going on, but but when you're young you don't really think that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Imean you don't really think you're going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">You may say it, but, but it doesn't feel like, you know, you don't feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You don't realize 1t what the word really means. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So we (pause) going back to back going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassa</span> , one, one, uh, day the Germans brought in these, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and we were rounded up, I think eighty of us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , old and young and and sick and, uh, crying and and, uh, even whatever little we had they took away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked on us and was, everybody was looking out under little <span class="DLF">windows</span> in the cracks which way we're heading, because nobody told us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I mean we, everything was rumored but no...nobody said you're going here or you're going there and we thought we're going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Everybody said, oh, you're going to work so it's not the worst thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We're going to work but, uh, my father sort of, uh, he was, uh, we called him a pessimist. (</span><span class="sentence" id="36">laughter) He he felt that he knew what that that it's going to be terrible and, uh, he said that we're heading for the, out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I mean because if we were going to work, they would have bring us to the other direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would go to the other direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And, uh, sure enough, in three days time--it took us, wait a minute, three days--yes, three days to arrive to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Tell me about that trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">What was the trip like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Well, you hardly could sit down in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and, uh, and, uh, I don't even remember having any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We must have some food with us but, uh, I don't really recall recall it. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And, uh, some people were sick, really out of their mind, old people, senile people and they were crying and yelling all night long and if somebody had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , then then there was a little, uh, little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> there, and everybody, men and women together, everybody, uh, seeing that you're going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It's, it was just so humiliating, humiliating and, and, uh, horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So all they can do is cry or pray or or or try to soothe each other and, and sitting down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and and mothers with their children and, uh, resting in their heads in their lap and it was just an awful trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And, uh, little did we know that at least we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">As soon as we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , uh, they were waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was or where we were and was all of a sudden they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and these these, uh, men with, uh, striped uniforms started to drag us out and the Germans, uh, patrolling with their German Shepherds and and yelling, " ; , schnell, schnell." </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Everything has to be done "schnell" all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And as soon as we got off, even our backsack what we could carry with us, uh, we tried to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They threw, they threw it all out on the side and we didn't need it anymore actually, but we didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And, uh, and men and women were separated right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Separate <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And, uh, when we were going in the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , uh, this this, uh, German officer in a uniform, he was just telling which way to go for everybody, left or right. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I remember him asking my mother how old she was https://collections.ushmm.org and she said, "Vierzig" [GER: forty] That's all she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And he sent her to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="58">Crying) But at that point we thought we going to see each other yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I mean we had no idea of, of, uh, what was waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And then they told us that you're going to see them later, that you're going to see them at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They're taking the young people to work and, uh, at night or or on the weekend you're going to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Uh, first they asked for the twins, if we had any twins between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I remember some who were twins and they took them out and then they were asking for other occupations, uh, to step aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The rest of us were marched to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , to, to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We had to take all our clothes off and put them nicely in a pile when we come out to find them, and they brought us into this huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the showers were overhead and they locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> on us and, uh, and, uh, hot steaming water came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Little did we know that our parents got the same showers with the gas on. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Uh, when we came out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> we came out on the other <span class="DLF">door</span> so we never got our clothes back, our shoes or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Even the last pin from my hair was taken out and, uh, we got a a dress, a grey cotton dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">No underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I got a pair of shoes which was three sizes too big on my feet, wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we were marched into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where there were these, uh, so-called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bleachers</span> (ph) what we were sleeping, uh, lay ourself, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Twelve of us on one, so if one turned around, all twelve had to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Uh, one bowl of, uh, soup without a spoon or cup or anything for the twelve of us, so each took one sip and and handed to the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And, uh, these, uh, Jewish girls, uh, were Czechoslovak, from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , were our Blockaltesters. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They were the overseers. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And they were telling us, tried to orient us of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> routine, what, how, what was waiting for us and they told us that, uh, you'll never see your parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You might as well forget about it because they are already in the, marched into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We just couldn't believe them you know in our wildest dream that that something like this could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We thought they were just, uh, being rude to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They they wanted to punish us for, for not being here the same way like they were for so many years already. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And, uh, we just shrugged it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We we, but in the meantime they told us if there will be a selection, just volunteer, volunteer for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Go out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">This is a death camp, and, and, uh, the farther you get away from it the better it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So happens after three days we were shipped, uh, the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were coming in day and night from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Actually I was in the first transport to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and, uh, day and night they were bringing 1n people and even the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> couldn't work fast enough for it, so they had to make <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We had to make room for the newcomers. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We were sent to, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cracow</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span> the Lager was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It was the most horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> on earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I think it was worse than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , even though it had no <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But we worked very, very hard there. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Four o'clock in the morning we had to get up to for Zahlappells, uh, counting of the rolls, and stay there for hours under the stars in our one piece of clothes and it was freezing cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">This was in May, https://collections.ushmm.org but it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and we had no clothes on and we had no food and and everybody was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And, uh, staying there after after the Zahlappell we were marched out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was situated on a, on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountainside</span> and our work was to carry these big wooden planks up on the steep <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , that we we stood like three girls or five girls on there, one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And, uh, German...of course like I said everything had to be done "schnell" and, uh, and, uh, they were coming with the German Shepherds to chase us to go fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Now when you have a three size too big pair of shoes on your feet and the mud, and it's muddy and and go up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountainside</span> , it's, it's terribly hard, and we were doing this work all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And by the time we came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , uh, sometimes the food ran out already. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Uh, the last people didn't get any or or else we got some soup with, uh, some barley, barley soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">That was our mainstay for three months, every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Barley soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And, uh, lot of, uh, after a while we were issued some clothes because it was, like I said it was very cold there in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We had some sweaters and, and coats and by the time we realized it, it was full of lice, this clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So, so whenever we could escape a little, hide from the work, our pastime was to kill the lice, the, the; 1t was, uh, we suffered a lot there from, from, uh, from the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">From the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp-</span> mates who were, who were not, uh, not good to us because they felt that we were, uh, spoiled or, or we just coming from, from our, our, uh, <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and they were already suffering for years and years and they thought we're not even Jewish, Jewish, uh, prisoners because you don't speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We don't belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But nevertheless, uh, we settled down sort of a routine until until the partisans began to really raid on the, make a lot of raids around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and, and the front was coming closer I suppose, so, so one day we were evacuated from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And we were sent, we were sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Of course we didn't know we're going there and this is, uh, uh, maybe a three-hour trip <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> betwe...between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cracow</span> , the distance should be three hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It took us three days to get back in the hottest summer, August 5th I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Hundred and thirty us of us in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was so hot that I remember one night I, I must have dozed off and I, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped so I woke up and it was raining and water was coming down on my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I thought to myself I must be losing my mind because I know that we started out with a covered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">How can it be raining? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Until I found out that the humidity in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> was so high that 1t was coming down in drops from the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We had absolutely no water, no food, no <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">After three days when we finally arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they opened the <span class="DLF">wagon doors</span> , we give thank God, thanks to God that we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we're perhaps going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , and this will be the end of our journey. (</span><span class="sentence" id="119">Pause) Uh, but we didn't go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We went back to another lag...uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I think it was the C Lager they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And, uh, our, we were full of lice I told you, so our hair https://collections.ushmm.org was shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Before they didn't have time because usually when a transport arrives, the women are all shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Their hair is shaved off but when I first came there, it did...1t didn't, they were such, in such a rush that they didn't, they didn't do it to us but when we fir...came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they shaved our heads which was good because we were full of lice, like I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And, uh, they tattooed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">This was just another...we really didn't care at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We didn't think that that we, we, we really ex...ceased to be human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were just a number already but who care...I mean it was beyond us already. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And, uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It was just a transport Lager alread...an an an experimenting Lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We...we didn't have to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But, of course, the food was very, uh, skimpy and, uh, and also we had to stay in li...in, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zahlappell</span> for hours long in the cold nights, so much so that I remember we used to, a group of us used to huddle together and keep each other warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And, uh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The rest of our times just, uh, went by, uh, without doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Just...just waiting, and...and... and...and uh (pause) they kept saying, uh, there were constantly selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Selections from us, but we didn't, uh, know where the selections were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So everybody was trying to avoid it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But nevertheless these, uh, inmates who were there a longer time kept telling us, "Just try to get out from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Because it's, uh...here it's, uh, the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> is always working. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Uh, if...1f you go away, maybe you'll be lucky and, uh, survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So one day, when there was a selection in our <span class="DLF">block</span> , uh, I was together with a cousin of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We decided that, uh, "Let's...let's go for the selection." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They needed five hundred girls for this selection;

QUESTION:  How did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Well we were we were I was working in the they called it where our job was to, to these parts we were dipping into these chemicals so they shouldn't oxidize because when they put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> they're, you know, rusty, they're not treated, uh, good enough so we tried to manipulate a little that 1t shouldn't be so good but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It was just a hope that maybe we did some good. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And, uh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Our, uh, German the, the Hauptscharfthrer (ph) who was, uh, the after a while he became very mean and we, we heard rumors that his son was killed at the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and he took his frustrations out on the Jews of course and, uh, but we were, we were--uh, in the midst of all our troubles we were trying to cheer each other up. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">If one was feeling very low, we, we tried to tell them, we, we dreamed about things what we were going to do when we got liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We were all...we never thought for a minute, I never thought for a minute that I'm really going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I, 1t just did not sink in. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I mean with all these horrors around me I, I always thought that we were dreaming of, of things--when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and I just want to see this, this war end and just live for the day when we see the Germans defeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And that kept us alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Never to lose hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">If you lost hope that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was so easy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">All you had to do is reach out for the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They were electrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We will not do them the favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We said if they want to kill us, they'll have to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We are not going to die (laughter) becau...because it's, it's, uh, if we knew that our parents would be alive or, or we said we, we, we fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We, we, we are going to stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But of course it, it became more and more heated the the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It it, uh, to us, uh, middle of, beginning of April we had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> because the bombings were unbearable and, uh, I suppose the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> shut down for whatever reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They, they put us back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and, and, uh, we were headed for wherever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> would take us and we were taken actually to several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And finally we wound up, uh, a https://collections.ushmm.org place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">At this time we belonged to, we were under <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> jurisdiction I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Uh, this, this belonged to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps Dachau</span> already and, uh, we stayed in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">When we arrived there we saw people there who were in much worse shape than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I mean they really looked, uh, walking corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And, uh, we had to go out to work, uh, mostly these <span class="NPIP">bombed out places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf</span> I suppose and, uh, cleaning, uh, bricks of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that were bombed out and uh ...the middle of the <span class="REGION">area</span> was such a bombing... that my ...cousin was laying next. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We were laying on, uh, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , uh, during the attack, next to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and and we couldn't see each other from from the smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But, uh, nevertheless, we didn't care about the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I mean we were happy that there were bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">One, uh, I just you, just didn't think about, uh, living or dying or whatever may come or, or you were a fanatic just to see the Germans defeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">That's all we lived for. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we knew it full well it, 1t will be done but the question was will we see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">With all our dreams and our deep-down each and every one of us knew that they're going to kill us in the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They're not going
