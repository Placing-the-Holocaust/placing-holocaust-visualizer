<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good afternoon, Flory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Can you please tell me your full name and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name is Flory Jagoda, and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">You want to know when? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I don't think I should tell you -- December 21st, 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">A lot of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Actually, most of the survivors are this age, maybe a little younger, a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But this 1s more or less around 70s and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And they have one thing in common -- silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">They sort of don't like to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We don't like to -- it is almost like a wound that, you know, you heal. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And you don't want to scratch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It bleeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And also, a lot of them do not want to burden their families, especially their children, with sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">They want to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And it works for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">You have children, and you have weddings, and grandchildren, and music lessons, and piano lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I was teaching music myself for 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So I was quite a busy lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Then all of a sudden, children leave, and marry, and get a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And you know, you don't sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">You sort of start dreaming, and seeing some images and faces of your family -- and, uh, you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And, uh, then you read these horrible stories- there was no holocaust -- never happened -- and you know what that means to a survivor -- no holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Your whole inner starts screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I think the age -- and I also think the story of the holocaust never happened -- is -- I think it broke the silence of a lot of holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Age definitely had something to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So here Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I'm going to take you to a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , and share with you my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Actually, I'm not going to start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We will go about 98 kilometers up <span class="REGION">northeast Bosnia</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> , very picturesque. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It's know for its <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pine trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My whole family lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Their name was Altarac, the Altarac family. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And they were very proud of their name. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">It meant , the high <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- very proud of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And, you know, all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> that you read today unfortunately, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Srebenica</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rogatica</span> to, which is close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorazde</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Travnik</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zvornik</span> -- all these little, tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> had -- besides Moslems and Serbs, they also had a Bosnian Sephardi Jewish communities. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">A lot of people don't know that -- Bosnian Jews -- <span class="REGION">Los Judeos Bosnia</span> , they would say in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Actually, they were descendants of the Spanish refugees that were expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> in 1492 -- the inquisition -- <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The word <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sepharad</span> means <span class="REGION">Iberian peninsula</span> in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Actually, they had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I mean, they had to leave, or convert to Catholicism, or leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They were given three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">A lot of them converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">A lot of them remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They couldn't leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they really loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My ancestors went towards <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">There sultan Bayazid II gave orders to -- throughout his Ottoman Empire -- to let the refugees in, give them freedom, to worship, to build <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , and, most of all, freedom to travel through his Ottoman Empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So there were big communities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> definitely became a thriving Sephardi community. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They called it a Yirushaliam, the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , with their <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> and -- so, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , looking for new opportunities, they went to these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that you read about today. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Now the life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> -- it was a very simple life. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The family was very close nit, about 15 families, 15, 16, families -- most of them, Altarac families. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And in my family, definitely, the leader was my nona (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="53">my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My nona was a kind of a grandmother that a child dreams of having, not because only -- I mean, her voice was something that was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">She sang beautifully. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But she was a midwife, a well known midwife, in all the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , she knew herbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always full of women with babies and children -- "What do I give to this one?" -- "</span><span class="sentence" id="58">What do I" -- "What herb do I use?". </span><span class="sentence" id="59">She was the one to put the first pair of earrings through the babies' ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And naturally, she was the leader of her own band, as we say in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- leader of the band. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">She had her own singing family, which was well known as the Altarac family, the singing Altarac family, five daughters and three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">She was the teacher of religion in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Women did not go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as much as we see here. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The men usually went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , took their sons, taught them Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And the woman stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition, religion, heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">All that she learned from her nona, and her bis- nona, the great grandmother, just went on from generation to generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They lived there for about four centuries, and the old peacefully died, and the young were born and married, and there was harmony in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> -- the Moslems and Serbs and Jews lived in harmony there. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I never remember hate or quarrels. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The women visited and the children went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I would never, never, never, believe that the madness of the Second World War would bring something. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So, uh, the life didn't have too much change. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And more or less, everybody was quite satisfied, went along with the life as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But my nona's family -- there was one daughter- she just couldn't take it -- that was my mother, Rosa (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And she was actually considered as a rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I mean, she always dreamt of far-away <span class="NPIP">places</span> , she read books that she was not supposed to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">If there was something in the family -- or the girls wanted to try something new, let Rosa do it first -- to eat something -- let Rosa taste it first. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">She was just very, very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So finally, she talked her family to send her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , which was a thriving -- I mean, big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at that time, huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And she went to stay with my tia esperansa (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Tia is aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I will be adding some of these Ladino words, because they just fit in with the words that I'm saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It's, as we call it, Lingua De la Madri (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="83">the language of the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">This was the language in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You passed the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and you did not hear Serb or Croatian words. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It was only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span> , as we call it, Judeo-Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Sometimes, we would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- with non-Jewish friends -- and I would sort of be a little embarrassed, I would say nona-- can't you speak so -- they'll think maybe we're talking something, you know, behind their back. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">She would look at me very seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">She'd say . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And she'd say, "You know, you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You have to speak Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="92">This is her Jewish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She considered that as her religious, Jewish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was written in Hebrew letters, Rashi. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And all her prayers were written in that language. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So she considered that her religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">She was very religious, and she raised a very, very religious family. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Anyway, going back to my mother, Rosa -- she finally managed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And she falls in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">She falls in love with a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And what did he play? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Accordion and guitar. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And he had a gorgeous voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The moment the family heard a musician -- I mean, it was something you should never even consider. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">A nice Jewish family -- I mean, a girl, a Sephardic girl, to marry a musician who plays for money? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I mean, you are blessed with a voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other people -- not to take the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But you know, nothing would help. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And as much as they really respected the father -- you never questioned grandfather -- whatever he said, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">She decided to marry -- Samuel Poppel (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="111">was his name -- very handsome Samuel Poppel. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And she found out very, very early that it was no big deal, because Samuel Poppel played all night and slept all day -- and at night, he was out singing , which is a Bosnian folk song. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And after she had the baby -- she right away had the baby, little Floritza, which is me, she wrote a letter to her father -- "I want to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And the father came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , he arranged a real Jewish divorce, and took his daughter and little Floritza back to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And she brought shame to the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">A divorced daughter in the family? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Never heard of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Never was a divorce in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So here she was with a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">She couldn't meet with a man because -- the single people -- single men are not going to look -- a divorced girl with a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So, she was very lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Her life was spent with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They sang a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They have, every Sunday, a picnic in different <span class="DLF">gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And there was a lamb on a spit, and a lot of singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So that was, really, her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I, actually, was never supposed to ask about Samuel Poppel. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was something you never asked, you never talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I never saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I don't even know what he looks like. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But my grandfather went right away to work to find a husband for Rosa. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The marriages were, really, arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The father, the grandfather, would call you, you would kiss his hand, and he would say, "I have a husband for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You would kiss his hand again, and you were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In one way, it was just -- it was very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">You didn't have to worry about the singles, or "Where am I going to meet a man?". </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And usually, the father knew what the -- you know, what kind of man their daughter needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So every little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Srebenica</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Travnik</span> as I told you before -- the families kept in touch, they visited each other, and they knew exactly who had daughters, who had sons, their ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And in between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , there were such people as Casmententeros, the matchmakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They usually -- it was a side job, besides what they were doing -- and they would get 20 percent here, and 20 percent on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They would match, give parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So they found a match. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And it was a salesman who was traveling from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They only spoke in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judeo</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The salesman too. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Everything was done in this Ladino language in between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So his name was Mikaiel (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Poppel -- no -- sorry -- Mikaiel Cabeelio (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Poppel was my father who I never met. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And Mikaiel Cabeelio comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> , and meets Rosa. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And by golly, she liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">She was very picky, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">She was a very pretty, pretty girl, pretty woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I'll show you a picture later -- very pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And they arranged a wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Naturally, I was not at the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I was sent to play with the cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was something that was not part of me, which -- it hurt, you know, later on -- when you get older, you think back, "Well, how could they do that to me?". </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Anyway, she gets married, and they go to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">This is what she wanted to do, to go live in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">To my happiness, because I was going to stay with nona. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I adored that woman -- just adored. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I think all the feeling that I have for this Sephardic culture, for stories, for songs -- it's all really a gift from her to me that I will have for the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was -- I considered her as my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I didn't miss Rosa. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It's sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But that's just the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  How old were you when they got married and left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Well, before nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I was about seven, or maybe even younger, because I -- no -- seven, because I stayed with nona two years, until they got settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And then, one day, my grandfather comes in with a hat on, a real hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You know, I was used to seeing my grandfather dressed with a . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">All the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasencia</span> and all these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- they were dressed the same as the Moslems. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">You wouldn't know which one's which. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They all had , and shuck sheers (ph.) -- </span><span class="sentence" id="178">that's pantaloon pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And he put a hat on because, I guess, he wanted to look a little more modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He was going to a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And, oh, it was tough on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I hated that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I'll never forget it as long as I live. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">My nona gives me an orange bag with the pictures of my family, all my aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And she said , don't ever forget your Mishpachah (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="186">which is, really, a Hebrew word. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But it's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And she gave me a little gold locket, which I still carry with me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And she said, "Anywhere you go, carry that with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So those were the two very precious things that I had all my life with me, even today. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I'll show it to you later. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">01:18:19 Coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> is like day and night, a difference of life and people and -- my mother -- I mean, I couldn't recognize my mother before anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">She was very dressed up in very beautiful clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And my stepfather, my new father, who adopted me -- and I became Floritza Cabeelio -- he started a necktie business, and she was in business with him, very active, very -- this is what she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">This is the kind of life she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">She could not take that small, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And she mingled with -- socially, with the Ashkenazi Jews, who are a little different than the Sephardim in that part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They were modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They were from Austrian background and they spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And socially, this is where she felt more important. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">The kosher that was completely gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I don't remember anything that was connected to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasencica</span> that I could see in her. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We did not speak <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It was all SerbaCroation. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And not only that. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">She had so many things prepared for me -- I think all the things she wanted for herself that she could never get -- had music lessons, piano lessons, ballet, and drawing, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maccabi</span> (ph.) -- </span><span class="sentence" id="207">that's like, a health club -- three times a week -- had tickets for the operetta on Sunday afternoon -- Lahar, I knew all the Lahar pieces by heart at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It was too much to take actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">She had a maid who spoke to me only in German because that was the language, you know, a fine language. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I couldn't -- I -- the only thing I would like to do is go back to nona and her Sephardi cooking, and her , and , and , all that Sephardi cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It was so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And to hear their language -- I miss that the most, that Lingua De la Madri. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And besides, I wasn't too crazy about Mikaiel Cabeelio. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I always felt maybe he'll take a knife -- and come in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- I mean, I had that fright, until one day I come out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and there 1s Mikaiel Cabeelio waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">He said, "Floritza (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="216">we are going to buy a harmonica today." </span><span class="sentence" id="217">A harmonica we called an accordion. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And it was my dream to have an accordion. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">If you have a harmonica, you are usually very popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Everybody wants to be with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">You can start a party -- but just the dream that I would never

<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  My wedding was gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I mean, I could spend hours telling about my real American army wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He brought a half a parachute so I could make my gown and all the lingerie. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He brought a piece of leather and we made the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">The whole company came to the wedding and hamburgers to order, hours of making hamburgers and the cook made a big cake and we had a big orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And everybody kissed the bride. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You know how many kisses I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Anyway, beautiful memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Uh, Sergeant Jagoda had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it was the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I stayed behind and left after. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">One day coming from work my father, is sitting next to Rosa and she is, I mean a stage again in that I would never imagine her to be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">She received a letter from her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It was a day before I left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and the brother, Lezo (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="567">writing to her that he is the only survivor of the whole Altarc Family. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I left the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It wasn't fair to her but my ticket and Red Cross Papers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> , everything was ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and it was almost like reading a book and saying "I'll never go back." </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I'll never this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Let me start a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">It's a beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I fell in love with the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> the moment-- I spent a week, I said "This is it, this is a dream come true." </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Anyway, a life went raising children. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And grand-children. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Taught music. '</span><span class="sentence" id="579">Till one day, I mean, I did go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I went back the first time with my son Andy and Lori, just to see Vlasenica. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But, you know, I was so into being an American lady, an American mother, raising American children and even giving them names like my oldest daughter, her name is Betty Lou (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="582">She hates that Lou. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">To me it sounded so American. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Anything that would be American was just a dream come true. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So I didn't even want to mentally think what happened to this one, or when it happened, or how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I wanted to be an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So going back to years or how many years I could go back to go to this point where I came to 40 years later, sometimes you don't see day-to-day. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But in the whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">You could see I spent great 40 years just being busy with things I love to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Mostly raising children. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I filled my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with song and folk dancing and folk singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And it was always parties and maybe I was covering up. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Covering up what I didn't want to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Kept always very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And when I went back with Andy and Lori the first time, my son Andy tells me "Mom, you act so American. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">You dress in pants." </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And I didn't even want to even know what happened, I talked to nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And then the second time I went with my whole family it was for my 40th anniversary present from Harry to give concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">We went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novisca</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Bringing all these songs back to all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> that have not heard these Sephardic Songs for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I, myself, could not sing these songs in front of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">My mother arrived three years later -- two years later to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and Rosa was a, really a holocaust victim . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">She was never the Rosa that I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I wish my -- I wish my children would have met Rosa the way she was vivacious and romantic and full of spark. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">She was always very depressed and what hurt her the most was she was very a proud Jewish and the communities that we lived in --it was only Yiddish her generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">One day she asked me "What is shiksah (ph.)? </span><span class="sentence" id="609">What is shiksah?" </span><span class="sentence" id="610">That hurt a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">That hurt her a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She couldn't take this uh, the whole life around her that was Jewish life and it was not her kind of Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The language was tough and you couldn't sing in front of her, the Ladino songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">She would say "My harmony died." </span><span class="sentence" id="615">See her sisters and her brothers, they had an unbelievable sense of harmony. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You would start a melody, they would harmonize it either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">No notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And if you hear, if you would sing in front of her, her face would go like this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">She developed a policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So there was no Ladino singing till after her death. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Then people approached me, "You are Sephardic, do you know anything about Sephardic Music?" </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Well, do I know enough about Sephardic Music. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was just sort of <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And the first ttme was when the Rockville Jewish Community Center had a Sephardic Music Festival and that was '77. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And I performed that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And since that day it just poured out. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And here I am, still doing it full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Not just myself, but with two daughters and a son, and we just do the same thing--I think what my nona did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Same thing, just going around and singing for people and bringing music. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So the second trip was just to go and give concerts which again, I had nothing to do with questioning or asking, but came in as a performer. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And all of a sudden again we go back, the children leave and marry and, again you start dreaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">It's terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I had this overwhelming need, I don't know, growing in me somewhere to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And that was -- I talk to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I say "Its crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">This is 43 years after, it's forgotten." </span><span class="sentence" id="637">But I couldn't fight it. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I had to go back and see what happened to this family that I loved, with my own eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Maybe Uncle Lazo didn't have the story straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Maybe my mother -- I mean, I found -- I started looking for excuses that I had to go back to find out for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I have a wonderful husband who puts up with all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Very supportive. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> 43 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Tape #2

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> would dock daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And we would all stand there and wait to get any kind of news, anything; that is, what's going around the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Also from there, we took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tugboat</span> at night and -- when we ran away toward <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Also, the children -- if you see that whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> -- we'd swim around it all day, every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And it's a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, even for a vacation, today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">It brings bad memories to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">But it's a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Well, believe it or not, the one in the middle is me, the teacher, the music teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">All of my students were a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">But this was the butcher's daughter and the baker's daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And that's where my meat and bread and olive oil came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">So they were really very important people in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And this harmonica, actually, is not mine, because my father went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City of Split</span> to change for a bigger one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">So this one is borrowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">But these are my students on the isle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corsila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Well, this was June 24th, 1945, the wedding day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Take a look at that Sergeant Jagoda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Isn't he a handsome man? </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">The wedding was really first class <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from the cake to the hamburgers to my dress made out of parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I mean, everything was just first class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And I love this picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Well, this is the farmer who started talking to us and telling us the story of the stormy night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And we are standing, actually, on the spot where he was telling us that that is where my family is, both of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And this is where we were standing, just frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">This is really when I heard the whole story about the Altarac family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> -- that's where they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">One day, I hope to be able to go back and put something there, a stone, a music lesson, anything that 1s sort of connected with this Altarac family who gave me so much and left so much behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">This is the badge that I talked about before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">It brings a lot of memories, a lot of pain, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">This was issued to every Jewish person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> -- and I'm sure in many other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> -- and you would not ever leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> without the badge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Because, God forbid, if they catch you without it, you are really in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">So miraculously, it just traveled with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I would make sure that this goes with me, plus my nona's bag with family pictures, and the little gold piece that you will see very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">There it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">This is the locket that she gave me after I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> -- and "Keep it with you anywhere you go" -- and I sure did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">It's very old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">It's broken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">But it's very, very dear to me. , </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">keys from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Most of the Sephardic communities know the legend of the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">When our ancestors left <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , they took their -- the keys of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> with him hoping that, one day, they will return. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I have written this song maybe 10, 15, years ago -- and it's on my first album, or second album -- where I'm asking where is the key that used to be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> that our ancestors brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">My cousin, Berta, when she left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> ___ that this Bosnian war -- she called me and I tried very hard to bring her to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , which I did, thank God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And she said to me on the phone, "I left everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">But I have the key." </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">This is my Uncle Layzo's watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Actually, my grandfather gave it to him for his good grades in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> had all that trouble and all the Jews were taken to that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">After that -- the reason, I guess, that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> was such in silence -- everybody had something -- because all of a sudden, 15 families -- all their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Somebody had to have all these things that were in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">My Uncle Layzo, after coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> , looked, searched, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for something to remember his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">He found nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Finally, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">In one of the <span class="BUILDING">pawn shops</span> , he bought this watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And this watch -- his father gave to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And in fact, when you open it, you can see his handwriting, "To my son, Layzo, for the good grades in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Education was always very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Again, a story of -- this, Berta gave me the first time I went to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">One of the neighbors was dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And she called Berta and she wanted to give her something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">It was on her conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And she gave her this buckle that belonged to the Altarac family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">As you see in the middle, it's a Magen David, and it was worn by one of my uncles, or -- I don't know whom -- but it belonged to the Altarac family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">It bothered the lady a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So she gave it to Berta. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">You know, a very talented musician of Sephardic music -- the group is called the Voice of Sepharad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Paul</span> , <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> -- David Harris (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">is his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">He called one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">He said, "Flory, I would like to commission you to write a song for my group." </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And he gave me two words, "You return what you find." </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Well, what did I think of about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I thought about going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> , , and "What am I looking for, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ?". </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And this is what the -- this song 1s all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">I will sort of speak it as you are listening to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">I start with thinking with the guitar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">That's what the guitar is coming out and doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And as I'm thinking, the scenes come out of the <span class="BUILDING">family houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I look at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , I look for roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And this is what you will hear now. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1183">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> are empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> are without happiness, and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> are without roses, and the carnations, and the beautiful roses that these people love so much in their <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> without the lovers, and the worst of all, there is no nonas wearing the little head covering, and the mothers with cradles that used to sing to the children -- where have they gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Where have they gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Where have they gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Everybody -- everybody is gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Everybody, everyone -- everybody is gone" -- the guitar is always your thinking and your searching -- "And the Rabbis that used to pray, the prayers that used to give us so much peace, and the weddings, the weddings of the young ones that used to sing and dance with the tambourines back to the mothers with their cradles that used to sing to their children -- where have they gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Where have they gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Where have they gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Everybody -- everybody is gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Everybody -- everybody is gone." </span>
