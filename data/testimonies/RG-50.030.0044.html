<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  The trip was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We were all crowded and, of course, I would never say that Iam Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We were all Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I am sure there were a lot of Jews...which I was afraid to talk to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I kept to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But then on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , they asked, "Who speaks German?" </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And I y) /) volunteered, and I said I speak German, I speak Hoch Deutch , not Plat Deutch (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Hoch Deutch is the cultivated German. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Plat Deutch, I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">As such, I was chosen as the fuhrer, what is 1t? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Not the manager, but the manager of the group to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because I spoke German and the SS men, they spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So they communicated with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">When they brought us all to German...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I was told because I was the fuhrer, the manager, the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Fuhrer is the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I will have a choice of where I wanted to go to work tin <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which I thought was a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I don't even remember how it looked, but it was a mass of people, not only our group but lots of people, lots of people and lots of mostly Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And they said to me, "You have a choice to go either on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> to an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition fabric</span> or to <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I thought for myself to be safer it would be the best thing to go on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Because I knew it'll be a lot hard work that I won't meet so many Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I was afraid to meet Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">That was the idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  And you still had the false papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  I still had my false papers as a Christian girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">As Maria Xowalcik. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">The middle name was Jadwiga. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">As such, I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as Maria Kowalcik. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And I thought for my own sake, I probably would be safer to be away from everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I thought on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , Poles would probably not likely go to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They might want to go a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , to some <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , to any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but I thought for myself, I would rather go to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">First of all, I was emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I was about 80, 90 pounds skin and bones when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Skin and bone. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And as such I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They told me where they are going to bring me, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krushart</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It is a small <span class="DLF">farm</span> that the man that owns the <span class="DLF">farm</span> is paralyzed but he has a son-in-law by the name of Karl Beck and a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">She was just married to this Mr. Beck. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And I was brought to Krunhart. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That's how I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I was a city girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I never knew what work means because at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we were wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We had maids, and we had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I never even knew how to boil a glass of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Very spoiled...very...really very well taken care of, and I had no idea what a <span class="DLF">farm</span> means...work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Anyway, but I adapted and I adjusted very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I knew that that's the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">That's the way it's going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I better make the y ?- </span><span class="sentence" id="517">4S best of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Describe the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Would you please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Was a very small <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They had an Uncle Karl. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I forget his last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And Louise and Mr. Beck, and Mr. Sharf and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">A very small <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We had about 6 cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We had chickens and pigs and all sorts of animals around the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Of course, I had to take care of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I had no idea how to milk cows, but when I came there, the nice thing was when I came to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , it was...it was June 16th or June 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don't remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I think it was June 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It was a nasty day; a rainy, nasty cold day and I had nothing with me, just what I had on, old clothes and my emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Just skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But I had my presence always. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">On a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , there is lots to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I better be careful eating, not to eat everything right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I had the presence of mind to be careful of eating not to get sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So the first thing I came there, it was cold and the woman, Mrs. Louisa Beck, she looked like a very terribly harsh woman, talk, big, but a real German woman, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I thought oh, oh, this is not the place I should have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">But she was very kind to me, very kind to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Really motherly almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">She showed me to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where it would be and it was very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a very small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bureau</span> and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But it was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The nicest part of it was when I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ...you know we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">feather beds</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...when I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , the bed was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And I was wondering what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">She had a warm bottle to warm up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I thought then she can't be that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">If she did that, she must have heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Of course, I was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">She didn't know that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So then I thought maybe life won't be so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Anyway, that was the experience and she gave me milk and ham and bread, but I didnâ€™t eat any. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I just had some milk and some bread and butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I was afraid to eat really, because I was hungry, emaciated and I thought... had the presence of mind not to eat everything right away but just go slowly about it until I get used to food again. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So then it really started. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">The next morning she tried to introduce me to everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">She had a brother by the name Ernst who fought in the army and he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He had a little boy by the name of Fritz. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He was then a baby about 2 or 3 months old, and she told me I had to take care of the baby which I was glad. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And some other chores she told me that I had to do in the beginning which was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It wasn't too much, but then they got me into the real nitty gritty, the real farm work. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">She showed me how to milk cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">That was the worst part. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Well, to milk the cows I remember for about a month my fingers were like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I could not straighten them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">You had to use force to use what do you call the (ph), and my fingers were like this for about 2 to 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I just couldn't straighten them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">But then slowly I knew how to do it, and it was...was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And I used to drink the milk directly from the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I milked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I drank the milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Anyway, I got very fat as you saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">After awhile, I was there about 2 months, I got very fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I had at that time long hair and I braided them and put them up here as you see will see on the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And, uh, then she taught me really what I had to do and it was hard work taking care of all the animals and get up in the morning about 5:30, go at night about 12:00 to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and feed all the animals, take care of the chickens, of the ...of the pigs, whatever we had on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And also I had to learn how to mow grass and the...what <t do you call this in English...the uh...uh...the...uh...you know where you make cereal from, grain, what do you call it.</span></p>
