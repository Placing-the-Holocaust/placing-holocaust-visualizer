id="878">My father knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he told us about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And I had but I, the extent of the -- I guess we only learned really of, after the war, that you know how many — but we knew that they had <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> that they all, that they died and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And we knew that the, the people you know didn’t, didn’t have the chance to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Except very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Some way there was a grapevines, you know and there were always some people who got news out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">You know like this one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which went into you know in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , when you know they at one time <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ’s Red Cross came in and they said we would, you know they put linen on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and everything you know to make it look good. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And then they said there will be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And hardly anybody went because they all, nobody believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">But one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> an der Oder Jews did and it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The Germans in some ways sometimes you had a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went almost https://collections.ushmm.org empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Because people were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">They said that’s a trap. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And but then these people talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So you heard things and so you knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I mean we didn’t know how many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I mean the number of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and this we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And we didn’t know the extent of you know how many people really were, I mean we -- how many the capacity was of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">But you know there is a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you know there were some certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> already within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where they tried out some of these things on the mentally retarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And so then the medical professions somewhere heard about it and it went so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So I think something to that extent, 1t was very difficult to keep it completely secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I never quite understand how people can say they never knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I mean didn’t they see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> coming in and didn’t they smell all this and so on you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">The trouble is that Hitler got in power. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Then the depression was and people were out of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And he promised them work and he built a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , he prepared for the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">He built the <span class="DLF">Autobahn</span> and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And people had money, suddenly had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And by the time they realized political wasn’t everything that great, they were trapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">That’s one reason I am somewhat afraid for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">How it goes, how Beck can get so many people to come to his things. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">But so it was a bad time. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And then there were so many people who really didn’t know any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So when Hitler, when they talked about them, the -- some people believe anything which is written black and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So it’s very difficult and I mean there was a curfew after the 20 of July when they tried to kill Hitler, Stauffenberg and these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">There was a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">You know you could see there where before when the Jewish still before they were all more or less dispersed. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">There were signs on <span class="DLF">parks</span> , no Jews allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And so also it was very obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And people can read. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">All the Germans could read. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">There were no people who couldn’t read. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">But I guess many of them, and some of the people were very daring and nothing happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">We had a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> teacher who taught us math and physics and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And he was https://collections.ushmm.org one of these golden Papi members. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">You know people who joined before 33. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">They had a golden rim around, they are a party member. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Party thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And this was a real join. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And they are enthusiastic about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And then he sent in 38 or 39 or something around there, he sent his membership back. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And he said that’s not the party I joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">He always kept on teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Nothing happened to him, absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">So some people, it was, they were always some, some people had a <span class="DLF">loop hole</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">They went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">The majority of my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> teachers were not party members. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But I guess I didn’t have enough teachers for them to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">It’s, I mean they, when they kicked me out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I worked, I was walking the <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> an der Oder, one of my former classmates which was really hundred, 300 percent Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And so was her whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">She stopped me in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she said I’m sorry that they kicked you out. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I said oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I guess for her I was just another classmate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">QUESTION:  What is it like to feel to be an outcast?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  Feels awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">When I was standing I remember that one time when Hitler’s birthday was, and everybody came in uniform, Hitler Youth uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So being a member of the Hitler Youth didn’t really mean that you were a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">They were all members and I was there private. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">It’s an awful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I always thought you know I would feel like I’m the only black in a white <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And nobody harassed me or anything, but I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said mommy next time I’m not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So then I started. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">When anything like this was going on, I didn’t go.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I was afraid more than I was feeling inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I maybe a certain extent yes, because when I went to <span class="BUILDING">physical therapy school</span> you know before I emigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I became, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Frankfurt</span> and became a physical therapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And one of the things I said to myself, I want that the people need me. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">That they want me. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Because before nobody needed me, nobody wanted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I also went then back to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , to American U and <span class="BUILDING">Catholic U</span> and I got two masters degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And I was a straight A student and I got a summa cum laude and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And people say oh you were so ambitious. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">But I had to prove to myself I can do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  Let’s get back to just a little bit to the post war. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Your sister left. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">You stayed with your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  Illegally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  Oh yes, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I took, I went to <span class="BUILDING">ballet school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">That was my big love. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I danced, I danced when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> an der Oder and I was on the stage at the <span class="BUILDING">state theater</span> and then they kicked me, they told me you couldn’t come any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">You are half Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">That https://collections.ushmm.org was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">That was more difficult for me really than to be kicked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I loved dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So then in 45, I went back to <span class="BUILDING">ballet school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I wanted to become a professional dancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And so I joined a group and we traveled and this was, you know at this point there was no <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So you could go very easy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And so then we went to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And every time I had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and they put on that I was illegally there. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And so but there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> a woman who took pity on me and she was in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where they give you <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Because you know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were destroyed so first you had to wait until you got something. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And so she said all right, she said keep in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Send me sometimes a postcard. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">So I sent her a postcard and one time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gerting</span> [ph] which isn’t too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and I got a postcard, come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> as soon as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I said ok so I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and I only went and you were so trained in those things, you didn’t say boo. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And I only said hello. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And she said oh I’m so glad you came because it’s no good to walk around without identification card. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I said mm hm, and then she gave me her phone and she knew very well you know that I had this, I had an East German card in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And in this foment that I lost my identification card, 1t was not written, whether it was east or west, so I got a West German card. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And at least then I could register to immigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Because then I was legally in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">I was always a little bit afraid then when I -- and one of my uncles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> sponsored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">But I was a little bit afraid when I then registered that the Americans would find out that I’m not really legally in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> but they didn’t or they didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">But then you see I was legally in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And then my sister was already here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And she had switched from history to sociology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">So she became a psychotherapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And she said you know you always liked dancing and gymnastics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Why don’t you become a physical therapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">That’s very much needed in the https://collections.ushmm.org <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and it’s really got restitution from the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And so I did and then so I’ve been, that’s the reason I didn’t come until 56 because I went there first and got my degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And then I worked one year because you know it takes some time before you get all the immigration

work and we do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And you make sure that your husband and your son is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">So they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And I said ok you can do it and so we had, you had to be and she was much taller than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And you had to be very strong to convince these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I wasn’t so sure if she can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">But you can’t let them know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So she did and she went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And then she had a martini with her husband and her son and then we went up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So she can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And then I flew down the <span

class="sentence" id="1116">You fly down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And so, so one time my mother was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And John and my mother and I, we went to a party and everybody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And then they couldn’t find me and I was sitting in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">At this point I was the chief therapist of the Easter Seal treatment center in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And they couldn’t find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And then they found me in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> , sound asleep because you know as a chief therapist I always thought if anything is I told the other therapists ok you take it easy and I took an extra patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And I was just plain exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So my husband then talked to the librarian at this point https://collections.ushmm.org at National Bureau of Standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">You know it’s not now National Institute of Standards and Technology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And he said you always loved books and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So I talked to her and then I took an exam with the civil service in translating German into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And after that I could work as a translator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And it was the National Bureau of Standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And after I was finished I thought gosh if I would be a few years younger, I would have flunked my own native tongue because it was in the old German script and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said John, they still have it in the old German script. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I was -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">So then I worked as a translator in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> at the National Bureau

or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">You have to have that master’s degree in library science. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">So then I went to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic U</span> and got the master’s degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And then I had to side paths because I didn’t have enough, I had all these medical courses you know so I didn’t have enough liberal arts courses so they sent me back to <span class="BUILDING">undergraduate school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">undergraduate school</span> and in order to get it faster, I said ok I take German literature and so I graduate, and art history because I had both of them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so I said ok so I got this and then I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And then I worked as librarian yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And I worked at surgeon’s (?) </span><span

function and if something is, also as physical therapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">You know like they said really when I was with the Easter Seal I had an old lady, then I thought was old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Was 80 or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">She had a hip operation and she walked with a cane. </span><span class="sentence"

id="1152">I said now if I’m in your age and just have a cane, I think I would be very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And she says you have to quit talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">You have nothing of my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I said you really want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And I told her my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And then she said oh, I think I am very happy to have acane only. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">But you learn to smile and people don’t expect that you have anything like this in your past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And at first I never really talked you know you didn’t talk about any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And but one thing, neither John nor I could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">We couldn’t have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I couldn’t put any, I thought it was so awful that I would never expose any child to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Who knows if not something like this happens again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And John was drafted, was 18, and he was at the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And he came back very badly wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">He has Purple Heart and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">He lives, he is buried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> and we both made the

class="sentence" id="1170">I just, I just couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I just couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And I confronted my mother and one time when Hitler was on and I said you know only because you and Fati wanted to have children, I had to be born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And my mother told me that later and she said she was horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And so, but it was so awful for me you know it was so awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had classmates, and I had friends, but I always knew that somewhere that it will hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And I just couldn’t see to have anybody putting into the world.
