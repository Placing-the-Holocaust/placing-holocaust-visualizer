<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Uh...My name is Fred Bachner. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , September 28, 1925, and I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> until the age of...uh...thir, fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I...uh...went to the Jewish...uh...<span class="BUILDING">public school</span> because...uh...as a Jew we were not permitted to go into the <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> so it was a completely Jewish...uh...uh...sustained...uh...<span class="BUILDING">schools</span> within the school system and...uh....1 grew up and I learned during the growing up in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...uh...Hebrew and English, which was...uh...uh...taken on an extended program. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from 8 o'clock in the morning til about...uh...3, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, with 1 hour of break for lunch which we were supplied by the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And ... uh...we had a very happy environment until the... uh... German laws started to tighten down and...uh...prohibited the Gentile people to associate with us Jews by... uh...starting out...uh...uh...forbidding us to go into certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> such as <span class="DLF">parks</span> and <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which...uh...was...uh...very well advertised in the anti-Jewish newspaper, the Sturmer, in which always had the big Jewish face with a big hook nose is a picture in front on the first page and...uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The really...the...the way I started to feel it was when...my friends...we used to live in a...in a <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and we got downstairs to play after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...when...uh...my friends came over to me and said...uh...my father said I can't play with you anymore because you are a Jew and I don't supposed to associate with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">That's when I really started to...to feel the...the crunch of it, that all of a sudden the... uh ... <span class="DLF">wall</span> started to come down and...uh...we sort of got forced into a more Jewish environment because the only way we could associate was...uh...the Jewish people and...uh...1 joined the <span class="BUILDING">Maccabee</span> which is the Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We got...uh...meetings every Saturday, get together and camp trips on Sunday, bicycle trips and...uh...I must say that they used to do quite a bit to keep us...the youth happy and...and Jewish oriented and...uh...then it...uh...boiled down that we had a <span class="BUILDING">sports arena</span> , outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , where we had the <span class="BUILDING">Maccabee schools</span> competing against each other and organizations and...uh...we started to be dependent upon...among...on...on each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Then I grew up and years past by and finally I started to get into the age where I had to prepare myself for my Bar Mitzvah which took place at the end of October 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">and...uh...I had the...uh...I had the Bar Mitzvah teachers...uh...somebody who was very, very knowledgeable in the Jewish Torah and the Maftir (ph) and all that, and...uh...my father wanted me to learn the whole Haf Torah which was Hazin (ph) and also the Maftir (ph) and [...uh...felt very, very honored to be able to...to learn it and to perform before my relatives and the congregation and...uh...1t took a hard...a long time for me to learn it but I managed it and when I...the day of my Bar Mitzvah, which was before the...uh...Kristallnacht and as it turned out, one of the very few Bar Mitzvahs left to be performed because... uh ...Kristallnacht was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> on November 9th, where all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh...I...] remember vividly that I woke up and the Kristallnacht was on the ninth of November...uh...and I got up in the morning and it was about 6:30 in the morning because I had to walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was a little bit of a distance from where we used to live and...uh...but the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was situated with the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in back of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , a very big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and...uh...I came...I left my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and...uh...I seen how the SR was...uh...destroying Jewish...uh...<span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartments</span> by...uh...breaking the glass and throwing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and...uh...all be...belongings out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> for destruction, just setting it afire or people just grabbing it and walking away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And as I reached the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , well I didn't know what to do there because the curt...window curtains were hanging out and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the back was practically destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The...uh...ark was open, the Torah was...uh...taken out, the Hebrew books were put in the middle there and set afire, and I was very distraught and didn't know what to do so my first thought was to run back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see if my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my parents are alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Thank God...uh...nothing has happened to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and...uh...we lived through the...uh...the assault without any damages except that there was a...uh...a...uh...search for people to look...to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because...uh...the Rabbi in...1n our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in his last speech said and I vividly remember it today, he said, "It doesn't become daytime before it really gets night." </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And what he tried to tell us that it is going to get worse before it's going to get better. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And naturally peopled started to take this into consideration and they started to talk about leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> any which way possible and there was an onslaught of the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> , appeal by <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and...uh...any...any...any <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> that...that would accept you to go without waiting for long term visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and...uh...that...that was the start of the exodus...exodus ...from the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> although...although this didn't last long because at the end of November, it was the assassination by a...uh...student by the name of Greenblat * in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to a...uh... German diplomat Neurath **...I vividly remember their names that set off another race or I should say that set off actually the...the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I'm sorry, I'm wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But the...uh..timing was that the end of November the...uh...the German police rounded up all Polish citizens and it was very easy to distinguish a...uh..person because...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a dictatorship country and you had to register with the Police regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">You couldn't change your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> without the permission from the police, and with the...uh...you had to give them...uh...everybody who 1s living there, their full name, their Jewish name or whatever it was, and...uh...then they had...uh...also the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So to pick out the Jewish...uh...names from...from the <span class="BUILDING">Police precinct</span> was a pretty...uh...easy task. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So this how things started to get worse, that all the Polish citizens were...uh...rounded up and my father and my mother were Polish citizens and automatically my brother and I became Polish citizens because according to the German law that you are...you...you become the nationality what your parents are. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And...uh...my father and my brother were deported to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was not prepared of the onslaught of thousands of people and for security reasons because the <span class="DLF">border</span> was very close with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they...uh...kept these people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at the <span class="DLF">border</span> until they were screened and got the permission to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where they were born...to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And so...uh...my father and my brother were picked up and they were on the transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they were detained at the...uh...<span class="DLF">Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They were there for 2 weeks until they got the permission to proceed to the...uh...<span class="NPIP">place</span> where my father was born and where our family lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And...uh...my late mother and I...we were not permitted to join them, so all of a sudden things have changed...uh...financially because there was no money coming in anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We had the big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My father was a well-to-do person in his own way in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and...uh...we had to sort of...uh...see how we can sustain ourselves by...uh...by doing some necessary...uh... adjustment. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Now...uh...we had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with a <span class="DLF">service entrance</span> and so on and so forth, so we...we thought that we would rent out a...uh...a...uh... <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and...uh...take somebody in to live there, and we rented it out to an elderly couple, and they moved in with us and they paid us rent which helped us to sustain ourselves to the time, you know, that...uh...until we can meet...uh...be together with my father and brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And...uh... we...uh...my mother did...uh...a few...uh...things. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She was a pretty good seamstress in her own way, and I did some odd work, deliver paper or whatever it was and got some income as far as that was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It was only pennies, but...uh...every, every penny helped that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And...uh...my father, as I mentioned before, after 2 weeks was...uh...capable to join...to go proceed to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he was born and to establish himself and wait for our arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Now the Polish government issued...uh...a red stamp in your passport that permitted you to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">On the interim we had some cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we wrote to them that things are bad, we need visas, which they started to...uh...to...uh...proceed with and they finally got the visas and they were issued to us about a week before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and...uh...then we had to...uh...have them transferred from the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Now the...uh...Polish quota for...uh...Polish citizens to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was...there was a 4 to 5 year wait so that picture didn't look very bright, but I must say that the Jewish Agency was working very, very hard to get the kids and the youth out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , out of the fire, and my grandparents from my mother's side, they left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in 1935 and they settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And...uh...we were in touch with them and...uh...they said we have...you register for...for a transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and then you will be able to proceed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ’. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So we packed up a suitcase and put it (chuckle) next to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and...uh...I...I made...I was sort of prepared, you know, to leave my mother and...uh...that I might get a telephone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">That's all we would have gotten and be at the...1n 5 hours at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and you're gonna go with that transport to...uh...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Uh...I also was registered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to go on a transport direct to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ” on Aliyah, but unfortunately, as it turned out that phone call never came and the...uh...letter for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> never came either because in June 1939, we got the call from the Polish government to come and pick up the...the stamp...that we are able to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And...uh...so my late mother and I, we went to the Polish government and got that stamp, you know, and we left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and...uh...on the interim, in the meanwhile it was too hard...these people got sick and anyhow I don't remember exactly what happened to the elderly people that lived with us, but...uh...we...uh...we moved out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and moved in with another...uh...another couple on the same...same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and rented one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Now we became the...(chuckle)...the...uh...tenants. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And...uh...when we left, we left everything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And uh...we didn't have anything to sell because we sold our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and this sustained ourselves to live...uh...to have food come in...in...uh...and as long as we were by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Now the big moment came and we purchased the tickets and we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...uh...to my father's...uh...to my father and my brother to be reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And naturally where upon arrival it was a great...uh...great occasion, you know that being separated for almost a year and a half that we...uh...finally got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So now came the worry for my father...what to do and where...where to establish himself because he...he didn't know by himself what to do in the interim...uh...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and he...uh...sort of waited for us to wait for a decision what my mother wanted...thought what the family should do. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So naturally we took...uh...sort of a vacation and...uh...my father and my mother...we...we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And...uh...we tried to rent an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there and to have whatever we had...the few suitcases go and, you know, we used to live with my father's family there, which graciously took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I mean, you know...uh...1n Europe there was no such thing...there was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the smallest <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> like they used to say, you know, and....uh...and...uh...1t came...came the time that we thought that we finally be able to carry on with a normal life because I would have to enroll into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and to learn to...how to speak Polish which is a pretty hard language. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And I...uh...then...then all of a sudden on September Ist, there was already a rumor and a feeling that war is imminent ‘Palestine before 1948. “</span><span class="sentence" id="51"><span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> before 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">and it might start any day because the Polish government started to issue orders that you tape up your <span class="DLF">windows</span> because from the air raid the <span class="DLF">windows</span> might crack and they shatter on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and hurt people and what not, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So the feeling was already that there 1s going to be a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And sure enough they started...uh...in...1n August, they started to dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> around the...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where...uh...the...uh... homefront would defend that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they were...they were full gung ho that they're going to beat the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But I couldn't see that with the horses what they had...not...not being mobilized at all, that they're going to have any kind of a success you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And the geographic situation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where my father was, it was not too far away from the <span class="DLF">German border</span> and it was only 10 kilometers away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswiecim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I will come back to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And...uh...we....the Declaration of War was on September Ist. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Naturally, right away we had air raids, and we had all kinds of...uh...war threats that the Germans beat the Pole...Poles, and the they take already and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we should evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So the people started to pack up on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriages</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand carriages</span> and they started to march out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into further away from the...from the <span class="DLF">border</span> to be in a safe zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So...uh...we took everything into a suitcase and we grabbed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> and put it on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> and our family we started to hold ourselves together and started to march to evacuate further in..into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Now I don't remember exactly how many kilometers we marched or so, but it was...uh...I don't know, it was about...we managed in...1in 4 days, in 5 days to go about...uh...100 kilometers or maybe 70 kilometers and we walked across the <span class="DLF">fields</span> you know, because the...uh...corn was already taken in and the hay and the potatoes were...only the potatoes were still out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> because this is a very big farm country, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So...uh...we started to go further and we...we walked further and who do we meet there? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Because they got ahead of us, not...not by...on the...on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , but they were parachuting in to the...to the <span class="REGION">advance areas</span> and securing the <span class="REGION">advance areas</span> and when we came, you know, the...we come there, we see the German soldiers and they said, "Oh, Go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That's all you...they ever use... "Whatever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> you are from, go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And right there and then they started a big anti-Semitism by the soldiers to...to see....the Jews...the religious Jewish people used to have beards, and big pais (ph), you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And...and you...you wouldn't believe it but they started literally to rip out the beard and rip out the thing, and you know...uh...so the Jews, you know, they started to...to take a bandage around the...the...uh...the chin and hide the hair from the beard in there, and when the German came, you know, you had a toothache or headache or, you know, whatever it was to...to save themselves with the beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And that's...that was actually the beginning of the atrocities that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And after...after a couple of days we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which we left and everything... everything has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The German Army occupied the...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or I should say maybe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And the...uh...they started to take every...uh...capable person who could perform any kind of...uh...work, they grabbed you off the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they took you in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they carried you away to perform some kind of work for the army, whatever it is...clean the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or clean the horses, you know, whatever it is to...uh...uh...to make it comfortable for the army. (</span><span class="sentence" id="74">Pause, drinking water) So that was the beginning of establishing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> which was supervised by the German army and it was that if you were a...first of all there was a...a...uh...order out that every humanbeing...every male person at the age of 12 or 13 has to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Otherwise, you wouldn't get any food stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Otherwise you would not get any privileges and if you are caught in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and you cannot document that you have a job, they take you and work you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So that is how my brother got caught and...uh...now he didn't get caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There was an order out that all the...uh...Jewish males between the age of 14 and 18 have to register at the police department and...uh...that...uh...that all of was change because they establish a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> where...like we have here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that you have a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , you have a president and a vice president and so on and so forth, and they established that for the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And they did all the work for the Germans registering. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You were registered there and they know everything where you lived and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And...uh...that was the legal...uh...that you were legalized and permitted to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So you had to register in that...uh...that agency you I will call it, and...uh...you...and they had...uh...and after...after you register...after 3 or 4 days everybody registered, then they sent a policeman to your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they took you down to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and they carried you away to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> that was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Now <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> uprooted <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and you had to take the roots out because that's where they built the autobahns, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And at the later date, about a year or 2 later, they built <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> there because they suffered heavy losses in the West where the German industry was and they relocated the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> north to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on and so forth where they could perform...work on...on ammunition and guns and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And that's where the workers...uh...got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they were erected overnight and...uh...that's where my brother was taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> at the 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So again, was a disruption in the family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I had to go and register to work and my father and my mother and so on and so forth, and I...I was...[ would say lucky or not, but I befriended myself with a...a Jewish girl and...uh...she was about 2 years younger than I was, and her father owned a...uh...a...uh...distribution center of sodas and beer. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And when all this...these things started to tighten down, I said, "You know, I got to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Can I get a job with your father." </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She says, "Sure, my father will take you down." </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Now by the time I...I...I tried to procrastinate it as long as I could, you know, and in the...in the meantime, the father's business was taken over by a Volksdeutsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That is a person who is Polish but has German ancestry in him, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So he just came in your business and he was the boss and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So...so I...so her father spoke to the guy and he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So what...what was the work, and I was...that time I was 14 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Uh...I was permitted...I was not permitted, I was given a team of horses and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> which I had to load in the morning with beer barrels and sodas and all that and go around in the...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and, you know, deliver it to the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , the luncheonettes or the...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">bars</span> , you know, wherever they...they sell beers. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And...uh...1t was a...a very demanding job because I had to get up at...uh...5...uh...o'clock in the morning and go to the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> and clean the horses, water them down, give them hay to eat and...yah...and then go out and load the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> up, you know, and take the beer barrels and...and lift them on God knows what you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So I...I did that and...uh...as a...as a young kid, I was capable of adjusting myself to it, and I took care of it the best possible way and it was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I mean the guy was tickled pink because I managed how to drive a team of horses and...uh...1n winter time we...uh...drove a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And...uh...there was no...no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I mean there were very, very few...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and...uh...it took a lot of learning to control a team of horses to...uh...get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> that...uh...pushes a load...pull a load, you know, and you go down the steep <span class="DLF">hill</span> and the horse has to hold it back and, you know, so it's ...uh...it's pretty dangerous, let me tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So my brother was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we got....uh...mail from him at...uh...14 days intervals or later or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My father was working in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for the army to make...uh...coats and so was my late mother, but they worked in different shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I was working in the <span class="BUILDING">beer brewery</span> and...uh...I was distributing beer and...uh...soda. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Now all of a sudden the...in the surrounding of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camps</span> started to spruce up, and...uh...they put their orders in for beer to be delivered and...uh...the ...the German boss I had, he said,...uh..."Well, you don't look Jewish, you know, and you _ have that...uh...uh...piece of silk cloth you wear in order to protect your clothing when you go down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to roll down the...the barrels of beer, and you can haul the...you can hide the Jewish star, you know, so you know if they question you, you can move the thing away and what you're gonna go to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and you're gonna deliver the beer." </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I did that and...uh...and lo and behold...uh...in my...you know, in my lifetime, I had...as we...as you will hear later, I consider myself a little bit lucky because I had very few...I had a few occasions which...uh...I will tell you that I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So I go into that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there and deliver the beer and I speak to the commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and all that, and I looked through the...uh...<span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> in a...1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and...uh...I see my brother there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So [...I was...[ was perplexed. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I thought my brother was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Now he 1s in travel distance from...from us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So I spoke to the commander and I said I have to...I have to go...uh... I... see somebody I know there. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Can I...can I go and see him? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You know, and I handed him a pack of cigarettes and he says, "Yeah, Go and see him, and...uh...but...but don't stay too long." </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So they opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and I walked in and I embraced my brother and as I was there, I also know that there was a school mate or...not a school mate, a classmate of mine in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So I see my brother and my brother...I said, "How do you get here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He says, "Well, I was a...uh...a...uh...first aid man for the sick people, and they got me...uh...to take care of the sick people here, you know, to administer first aid, and that's how I got here." </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I said, "Well, that's great. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You know, I come here...[ come here every day." </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And...uh...all of a sudden I asked...I said to my brother, "You have people die here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He says, "Sure, we have at least six, seven people a day." </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I says, "I mean I...[ don't know til today how that idea came into my head." </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I says, "You have any way to bury them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He says, "Yal, we save them here for...for 3, 4 days and then we carry them out and take them people and carry them out and bury them." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I said, "You think if I talk to the commander and I can arrange to carry the people into...to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which the name is Chrzanow C H R Z A N O W (chuckle) and...uh...uh...you think, he might go." </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He said, "Look, all you can do 1s try." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So, I said goodbye, you know, and I said I...I'll be back tomorrow for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I talked to the commander and he said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">No good." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But anyway next load I went out there with beer. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I...uh...took some bread along and...uh...I...Uh...took bread along for my brother to distribute it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to give it to my classmate, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You can imagine the...the joy we had and...uh...we established some kind of a contact...my brother established some kind of contact with some of the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But anyway he...he suggested that to the camp commander and the camp commander says, "Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Why not, you know." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So I said, "You know something, I am going to come back on Sunday with a...with the boxes for dead people you know, and we going to take all the people, you gonna take 10 people with two guards, you gonna go...you gonna march into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we are, we gonna bury them with a Jewish burial and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And...uh...the camp commander, he must have been a pretty regular guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He accepted it, and he said, "Yal," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So I came out on Sunday and I had the...the box loaded with bread and shoes and everybody and for the...for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , you know, I spread the word that this and this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I met my brother and this is...we gonna arrange and, you know, so any way Sunday I came out and I picked up the dead people and they came and marched in, went out to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and then when we were finished, we took the guards and we gave them water to drink and gave them to eat and the...uh...we took the 10 people in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , in the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and...uh...the people had cooked up some soup, potatoes, and they bought clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You know, it was unbelievable you know, and uh...that I established that and it...it lasted for about another...another two months, that [...uh... uh...was able to do that without any complications. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But then complications started to come in because we...uh....uh... they had...they established the delousing ...uh...<span class="BUILDING">factory</span> 1n...in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I said, "You know, why don't you get the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in there." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Now, I was the instigator because it was in my blood and I did it all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So I instigated the...uh...the...uh...the situation that the...uh...whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in two sections, you know, and...uh...they were all fed, and you know, the guards, they had more guards come in because there were more people to watch and...uh...it was...1t was a very, very rare and seldom occasion, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And here I might inject also that I also went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to deliver beer there and I seen what was going on because we seen the transports that was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had to go through that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and we heard the crying, and we heard the...the...the distress notes, you know from the people in there, because they somehow sensed where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But unfortunately the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were black. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You know, they were blacked out that you couldn't see anything, but we knew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> are going and where we think they're going and...uh...when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to deliver beer I had some contact with people working there and I spoke to them and they told me what's going on, so I brought the news back to the...to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You know, I was kind of the...uh...like they say in Hebrew, sheliach (ph), somebody whose...gets the messages back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But every...everything...every hour the good things come to an end and...uh...one morning I left my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I got downstairs and I noticed that the...uh...the German army...they cut off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they sent all the people that were walk...walk...walking at that time in the morning, 5 o'clock in the morning, send them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They wouldn't let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So being the rascal I am, you know, I went...uh...through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Now I went back upstairs and I woke up my late mother and I said, "Look, there's going to be something. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Maybe they're looking for butter and eggs that you might have more than...than your coupons give you...uh...and...uh...you miught...uh...would like to hide something to do it because something is going to happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I managed to get myself across the <span class="DLF">fields</span> into the...the <span class="REGION">property</span> where that <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> was and into the...uh...uh...stable where the horses were. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I cleaned the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Then the owner and the father from the girl came and...uh...we sat down and we started to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">What is...why is this thing to do, and what is going on, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So the German...uh...boss came back to us and said, "You know, they're taking everybody out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There's nobody here. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">There's nobody...uh... uh... left over. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But you stay here as long as you...as you want." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And...uh...1 mean I had experiences before where the, you know, when they were looking for people...be able to send them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They came to their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They...you know and I knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I was hiding there and...uh...but this time, I think that was the end of the rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So we did...uh...I loaded up the...the...uh...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and...uh...but we had to send somebody else on the route where I...which I supposed to take care of and we were hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And we were hiding there all day long til in the evening and we said now nighttime is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">What...what...what is next? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">You wanta hide here? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You wanta go somewheres else in...uh...you know, in the nighttime? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And...uh...we did...uh...with the news that we had, we decided...they decided that...uh...1 mean I was the youngest one there, so (chuckle) naturally the...the grownups had more to say about it, so (pause, drinking water) we decided to talk to the German boss that we were working for him all day long and now the day is over that he should take us back to the police and whatever it is that he should do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And that was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We were brought by the German...uh...boss from the <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> ...uh...to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and...uh...we were... the reception was very cold and, you know, "aha we have another four Jews here. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Let's get rid of them." </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You know, So naturally we were taken down to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and put into the famous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Not knowing where we go, but we were told that...uh...that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to go into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So how true it 1s we didn't know, but after being a...uh...being in the...in the...uh...situation, you know...uh...uh... constant, I mean, you...you...you cannot put yourself today in the...in the mental condition when you're faced with...uh ...uh...uh...death or life or...that...that what it boiled down to you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Either you go for life or for death you know, because these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in between it was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , so you didn't know what...what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> you were on. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But anyway we...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> finally set itself into motion and...uh...we were transport into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Markstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The name was Markstadt. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Now we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and...uh...you know, the...the reception was (chuckle) was...uh...you got the beating, you had to fall in <span class="DLF">line</span> , you had to do lots of things you didn't do before in your life, and...uh... you were assigned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> at that time, and...uh...all of us... then...then we were...uh...told to fall out and we were going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And...uh...we went to work the first day...uh..and when we came back the...uh...there was a rumor that there...from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , was gonna go a transport to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and there is a...a transport is coming from our city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chrzanow</span> into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we are going to go out...where the...where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is going to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And somebody told me that my father is going to be in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Now, I am going to say something which...uh...you know, lot of people wouldn't understand the reason for it, but what I witnessed that day being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they beat up the elderly people and make mush out of...out of them, you know, and the...the way they talk and the beat them and all that, I...1 personally wouldn't be able to stand it, to see my father being treated that way and...and be...be there and not be able to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And if I would do, I would get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So I said I have to get myself into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and...uh...I...uh...was able to manage my...manage myself to get into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and be transported out...out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And...uh...today, I...[ must say that I am still amazed that what I am going to say is that I received word that my father's going to be in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And there was no radio, there was no mail, there was no communication, but somehow news leaked out and whatever it was...and it actually was that my father was in the transport coming to that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I got transported out to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was...was <span class="NPIP">hell on earth</span> because it was a...a old...uh...<span class="BUILDING">mill</span> which was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...uh...four floors up and...uh...we had to get up at about 4:30 in the morning because we walk...we walked to work which was about a 10, 12 kilometer stretch. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But to...the...the getting up in the morning was there were people with a...with a...uh...whip and they started on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> to...to whip the people out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and to get you down to stand for...to be counted because we did that six times a day, and God forbid somebody should...should run away or something which was a impossibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And...uh...so in other words there was a narrow <span class="DLF">staircase</span> like in a <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> going down to the...to the...to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where...where the...uh...to the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> and...uh...it was the...uh... very, very...uh...uh...close situation that we went down there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So we went...uh...but we didn't walk down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , we flew down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and...uh...then we walked to work, and it was a very un...uh...unclean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because there was no wash facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There was no soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">There was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And...uh...uh...the end result was that after awhile...uh...typhoid broke out in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and...uh...three quarters of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> died and...uh...I was...I was a lucky person. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I contracted the typhoid...uh...at the very beginning and...uh...I was lucky that I had a friend of mine who...uh...when he came back from work, he looked after me and he brought some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We had no...no...uh...fever thermometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We had no...uh...no first aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We had no medications. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="206">You were just laying there, and you were dying, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And...uh...I was lucky that the guy came to me and gave me water to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">That...uh...that kept the fever down. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I don't know if it kept it down enough, but after about 2 weeks I started to get better and started to come to myself...uh...and...uh... then I...] had to get up and...uh...be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and get md of the dead people and, you know, and...uh...clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , attend to the sick people, whatever could be attended, you know, make them comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Uh...You know, their mouth was dried up, you know, with...uh...with...uh...mucous, whatever it 1s, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They choked to death.

class="sentence" id="213">And then all kind of after sicknesses started to...to develop, which also took a lot of people. [...</span><span class="sentence" id="214">I never forget there was a guy, you know, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were three tiers high, and he was on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He was from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and...uh...he was completely corroded. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I mean he fell...he fell...he fell off his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I'll never forget as long as I live. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He...he fell off his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and his head was...was split open like a...like a rotten tomato. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Can you imagine that? </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And that was...that was the way that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And...uh...after we kept...more people started to get better so, you know, it was a little bit easier for us...the survivors from the typhoid, I mean, to form the...the...uh...task that we were asked to do because we...we took...uh...you know, we...we were...we had to dig a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> ...a...a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand wagon</span> loaded up with 10 bodies, 15 bodies and we rolled it over to the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and just flipped the thing over and the bodies just went down there and nobody knows who, what, when, or where, and...uh...and then, you know, there was diarrhea. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There were all...all...all kind of other sicknesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I mean I... had the puss disease here in my neck and puss, you know, it was swollen up here. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And the...uh...uh...puss was running out, you know, like...like...like from a faucet, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But I kept to myself in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I...uh...keep myself as clean as possible which was pretty tough task in itself and I managed to...to kept myself always on the upper echelon because I...1 associated myself with...with people and...uh...you know, and...uh...we managed to...to overcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But it was an hour to hour situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We lived through one hour so we say well, let me see if I am going to live through that hour, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And...uh...the morale was...was not bad because I...I survived on hope and I said, you know, alright I lived through this hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Let me see how I making out the other hour, and that gave me hope to...uh...to continue to...to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So, then the...uh...there came an order to liquidate that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and we went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there was a shortage on food, and they gave us rotten...rotten potatoes with...they gave us a spinach...maple leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They cooked it up and...and...I...1 mean we were that hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We were starved, and we couldn't bring ourselves to eat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And you could pick up portions after portions of...of that thing, they thought they're gonna feed us, and we...you couldn't swallow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You couldn't swallow it and...and despite the fact that...uh...hunger was great and everything that the...uh...1nmates...uh...stole the bread from one each other and...uh...1t's unbelievable.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Tape #2
ANSWER:  Now...uh...we were transported between the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They were...uh...within about...uh...a distance of about 15 kilometers or something like that and their name was ..uh...Greditz (ph) and...uh...Falbruck (ph) and...uh...one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they used as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian POW camp</span> and I...I...[ must say that...uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when we got in there was...was so...so dirty, feces all over and...uh...uh...from the Russians, you know, and...un...unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Unbelievable! </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And...uh...1 don't know what the reason was that the transport was back and forth, but...uh...all...all the bad things got to come to an end too, and one day they...uh...took us out to the appell <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they counted us, and...uh...well the Germans are very meticulous in that situation that they like to know how many people walk out, how many come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And...uh...they...uh...started to take ...uh...people and...uh...started to...uh...take them and...uh...put them out...uh...into a separate <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And...uh...here all of a sudden there was a rumor that the...uh..high ranking SS...uh...SS...uh...uh... man or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sturmbannfuhrer</span> has a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that he lives in that...uh...he wants...he needs people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But what I forget to mention is that...which is also very, very important...that in that...1n that...uh ...<span class="BUILDING">mill</span> ...the...one...one evening, you know, we...we had a <span class="BUILDING">wash barrack</span> with 10 faucets to clean yourself so you can imagine we were about 1500 people in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We had three tiers of...uh...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> there that the...the constant threat of death was so imminent that one evening the...the guard had a...had a drinking party or what...came over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and took...uh...15 people out and...uh...marched them out into the <span class="BUILDING">wash barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And...uh...next morning we went into the <span class="BUILDING">wash barrack</span> and they were all laying dead there. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And...uh...again I must say that news travels...although nowadays we have (chuckle) the computers and radios and videos and all that, that...uh... they...they got drunk and they had a good time by drowning these peoples by putting a...uh...water hose into their mouth and turing on the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So these were  the...the...uh...yvou know, that the...the constant...uh...dread of death and dying and the surroundings that you were...the environment that you were in has nothing but...but death. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And then we had some younger childrens in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that...uh...we tried to protect them from not working in the...uh...with the regular labors that they go there and do some odd work there...uh...that the children could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Now to come back to that...uh...the transportation...to the transport to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We were singled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I think there were about...uh...200 people, and I was among them and...uh... we...uh...went to that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that...at that...not that SS...uh...colonel was in charge of and there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that...uh...we had to work in...and we had to take out the glass because from the air raids, the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ...the glass got shattered and...uh...1t was hanging in and constantly falling on the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So we had to go up...you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">There was a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> , you know, with the glass roofs, you know, and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were broken out and we had to go up there on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffolds</span> and...uh...get the...get the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> out and plus...uh...there was all kinds of other works involved besides unloading the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> because they are building a...uh...<span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> , from...uh....uh...<span class="REGION">West Germany</span> , and...uh...they needed...uh...needed the changeover procedures where we had a lot of cement to carry on our backs. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oxygen tanks</span> and...uh...the...uh...<span class="DLF">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German railroad car</span> was so much in demand, like gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">You could not...you could not keep that...that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> a minute longer than it was needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So when there was no...uh...locomotive available, we...the...uh...1nmates had to pull the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> out and we had to...uh... put the brakes on so to speak of the...is a hand brake on the...on <span class="BUILDING">cubby house</span> or whatever they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I was in the...in one of these...uh...details and...uh...out of the...uh...<span class="DLF">ramp</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> was parked, there was a little <span class="DLF">hill</span> and a little <span class="DLF">incline</span> for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> means a lot, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So the rascal I was...I was a little bad, so I told the fellows working on it...1 says when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> starts to pick up speed, just take your hands off and let the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So we all did that, and we knew that we gonna get punished for it, but I think I achieved a great deal with it because this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> was about on a...on a...on a <span class="DLF">ramp</span> where the railroad...where the rails were linking it with the main... uh...rail going from one big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to another and that's where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> went after we let it go and...uh...1t created a little bit of a havoc like a little accident by having a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> running into in. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That was one thing I did I...1 schemed something always up that...uh...would...1 would do or have it initiated to be done despite the fact that I knew that the punishment might be...uh...death. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But that was one way of...for me of getting even with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Uh...Coming back into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we worked on a...uh...1n...1n a detail where...uh...we were working with a machinist and...uh...we were holding the iron rail or something and, you know, by... There...there are certain things you can do while you work, an...uh...1t could look accidental and that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Accidentally the rail dropped on the feet of a worker that they had to amputate his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Not that I was a big hero but I had some satisfaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Then one day we go out to work and then all of a sudden at 10 o'clock come, be assembled and...on a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> there and we were led into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> , and all of a sudden the rumor was that we are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And we were not very far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , maybe...uh...by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> 6 hours, 7 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So sure enough, by the time it got dark we entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But our lucky...our lucky...uh...thing was that we came from a high ranking SS general so they did not make any selections where they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , you know, to the right and to the left, and you know, to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> or to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> without going...uh...through a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So now we are in that famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> where we seen the ovens burning 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> arriving day- by-day, and we see what...what has to be...what...what...that...that is one step closer to death than...than we were before. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> alright and...uh...next morning, you know, 4 o'clock in the morning, 5 o'clock in the morning, you had to go out the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and...uh...be counted again. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And then we walked out of the...uh...out of the <span class="DLF">door</span> or the <span class="DLF">gates</span> I should say...uh... and a...uh...big orchestra played while we were marching out, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And...uh...we....uh... we came...we went to the...uh...to the...uh...uh...<span class="DLF">building site</span> and we were also again working for...uh...I1.G. Farben. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">This is a big German industrial company. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And...uh...we started again this...uh...uh...loading, unloading coal and...uh...cement and...uh...uh...the cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The cement I forgot to mention it before that the paper of the cement...when they emptied it out, we used to grab it and put it around our body to keep warm in winter time, you know, because we didn't have any winter uniforms and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the...uh...temperatures is about 40 below zero and the snow is...uh...sky high there and especially if you don't have any snow clothes like you have today. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And...uh...it...we...1t became a very...uh... handy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">You don't know how...how a humanbeing can be so...so to...to create things to help himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Is all that...uh...that you feel that things are...are dependable upon your life, that you...uh...that your life depends on it...that you wanta survive, and you...you grab any chance that you can to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And...uh...then we...uh...in...uh...in...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we were also... It was a very, very flexible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They had the...uh..<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> and next to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woman's camp</span> , and then they have the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> ...sick...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sick bay camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> was right...the <span class="DLF">back door</span> from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bay</span> ...from the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was right to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So you get in there and you not getting better, you go right in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">There was a rumor...I...I happen to be a little bit lucky and I got myself into a detail to work on shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">To rip up the shoes' soles. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Why did they do that besides...uh...collecting hair and besides collecting all kind of other materials? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They found out that Jewish people, especially the ones from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and all, that the people put diamonds and...and gold into the shoes to have something for them to sustain themselves in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And naturally the people got killed and the shoes were left over, so every shoe got...uh... ripped apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And we found diamonds in there, you know, but there were somebody watching you when you ripped the shoes apart that you...whatever you find, you turn it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And...uh...I...uh...1 must say despite the fact that everything was so bad, I was... was a pretty lucky fellow like you will hear from now until later. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I met...1 met a cousin of mine in that camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And she had a little bit of a position, and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> a long time so she established herself already a little bit and...uh...after meeting her through a <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> , she managed to...uh...get me some extra food which was a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And...uh...she was a run...a runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">That was a runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">She was working for the <span class="BUILDING">camp office</span> , and if there had to be any mail...uh...put in between the mail box from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camp</span> and that camp or orders or whatever it was, she would take the mail and run over there and come back and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I mean there was no telephone connections like we have it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But...uh... the... uh... met her through...through the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And we were pretty close cousins because she used to be also with me in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village Chrzanow</span> and...uh..at the time when the all...uh...cleaning out of the Jews was, they escaped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That's where she was, and that where she got in the camp and also be deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Uh...Now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> there was...uh...lot of things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">There was the...uh...breakout from a commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">People worked in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> and they smuggled ammunition into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They...uh...escaped, but they were caught back later 2 days and...uh...they were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And...uh...uh...at that...now I am talking about already the...uh... going into the winter of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And...uh...the snow was pretty deep there. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">The reason I mention that because we...we wore wooden shoes and the snow sticks to wood, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So when you had the wooden...uh...shoes, you know, not only that couldn't you walk with them, but you also had in addition to carry the snow and try to scrap the snow off so you could walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself was erected on a <span class="DLF">potato field</span> which was when it rains was nothing but...but the mud bath that you put your foot in the water puddles and, you know, you came out with...with a lot of mud on your feet, plus your ...your foot when into about | foot of water...uh...uh... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> , but puddle. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And...uh...but the...uh... word that the war has taken a turn and the Allied Forces are making advances started to take hold by seeing that the Germans are starting to liberate...not liberate, to...uh...dispose of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps and</span> sending the...uh... prisoners out to different camps located further into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Now we had in..in the camp Jewish doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They didn't have any medications or...or bandages so what you have, but they were Jewish doctors, but they make themselves now all of a sudden that the word was out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> are going to be liquidated and they're gonna got to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they would not have the position of a physician...as a doctor like they had in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they would be forced to go out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So they manufactured that an epidemic broke out...uh...and...uh...due to the fact that we didn't have any...uh...razor blades or shaving cream and we shaved the best way we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">You...you used to have...uh...uh... rashes on your skin that...uh...looked... looked like an epidemic and they filled up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sick bays</span> in the sick camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So some people got well and some didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And...uh...how my luck wanted to have to be it, I was transported to the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> because I had the rash and...uh...[....uh...1 said to myself, "Well, you're in a mess now. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">How're you gonna get yourself out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So I sent some messages to my cousin because she knew some people there...(cough)...that...uh...she wanted...uh...maybe she could...uh...get me out, but she sent...uh...sent me word back that there is nothing she could do about it, and I should see what else I can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Well, I kept myself to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I didn't wash with any soap or with anything that was laying around, and...uh...after about a week a doctor came around and...and...uh...1 was already a long time in that <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> and...uh...they needed my...my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So...uh...he came around, he looked at me, and...uh...the stone was taken off my heart when he said...uh..., "Go get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You go out." </span><span class="sentence" id="329">you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So L...I...I really I was reborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">That...that was the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So [...uh...walked out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like a...like a...like a practically newborn person because this was...this was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So I got back into the...to the....uh... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> and I got back on...uh...on several details and...uh...1 managed to get myself onto a detail to work in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woman's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And...uh...I didn't do any hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And then on January 3rd, 1945, we...we heard all of a sudden guns shooting and...uh...from the Germans, you know, they said that the Russians are about 80 kilometers away from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And then there came...as we were talking about that, there came a order the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> will be liquidated except the ones who attended the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So...uh..by the time they got us organized and...uh..we were in a...uh...in a marching...uh...group and I had...I with my friend we kept each other together, and they gave us, each of us, a whole loaf of bread, you see, and then they had the <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchen</span> by with horses to join us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And...uh...the...the ...uh..order of the day was that we are marching out to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and...uh..we will remain there or we will be shipped out by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But if you cannot walk, the guards have instructions to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So we started to walk and the three of us used to keep each other together with each other carrying a blanket and...uh...and...uh.. a loaf of bread and...uh...we seen that the people started to fall because it was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It was snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And...uh...we seen that the counts started to thin out and we walked in...until daybreak. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were under...uh...exposure for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They dropped...uh...uh...Christmas trees. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">By that I mean that they dropped...uh...uh...lighting bombs that spread out and lit up the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> and we were afraid that they would attack us because they might mistake us for troop movement, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But...uh...we mentioned...uh...we were told that they arranged...uh...to stay over the night in a...a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we will continued to march the following day. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So one of my friends said...uh... "Fred, this...this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I...1 don't care what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">This is all I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I am going to stay hide myself in the hay, and...uh...you do what you want." </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I said, "Don't be a fool." </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I said, "In the morning, they gonna light up, the whole thing gonna burn it up, and that's what's going to be." </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But as...uh...as history was, I met him after the war and he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He was liberated about 6 months before I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So we came into another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the...uh...1 mean if you know how sardines are in a can, that's how we were when we laid down to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I said to myself, "Fred, you cannot go through that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">You are at the end of your strength, and you better see that you get shipped out here and as soon as possible." </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And sure enough the next morning, they assembled a...a....uh...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And, you know, they assembled the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and, you know, you were...you were...uh...uh...you stood up and like the army, you know, in a column of 5, you know, and about 200 people or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And then they came in, you know, you, you, you, you, you. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Face right. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Go over there, and go over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Then you went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , and you were transported out. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So I managed myself to get out of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was standing and get myself squeezed into that column that went for the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It was in an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> in the middle of winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was snowing, and it was cold because we had no...uh...no heat and we were squeezed together in...uh... in...uh...1 don't know how many people were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but if you wanted to move, you couldn't move because you were really squeezed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And...uh...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It only moved a couple of kilometers and then we stayed again and meanwhile people started to faint and started to die, which we threw them overboard out to have more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And...uh...it turned out that we were about...we were on the famous...uh...air raid on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">That is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they carpet bombed that whole <span class="REGION">area</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And we were standing there and we felt the...the whole earth shaking but...uh...uh...you couldn't go nowheres because you had the guards with the machine gun there. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And...uh...we....uh...sort of...uh...you know, we sort of wondered what is going to happen to us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I mean if they bombed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> can't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They got to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">There was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> nearby that they could take us out and then put us into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">All these ideas started...uh...to come up, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">You started to be a...uh...a general to lay out the...the... uh... the way the...the German army plans these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Well after 12 days we finally arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We...at that time, we had plenty of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because plenty of people died and we just...uh...threw them overboard and...uh...we opened our mouth when it was raining and when it was snowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">At one time, they gave us something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They put us...I don't know, some army post came out and give us some...some kind of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And we...but we were nothing but skin and bones, and...uh... we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> the troops...the troops, the SS men, jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and shouted Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You know, you put yourself into...into the <span class="DLF">door</span> opening and you fell out. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">That's...that's about the size of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And...uh...crossed the dead people in there and whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So we got somehow off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we got...marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and we were put into a...uh...uh... uh...there's a word for it that they keep you and...uh...and you get...that you get your strength back which...uh...we had 2 weeks time. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">You know, we were put in that special order, and we didn't have to go out to work and we were medically taken care of, and we...uh...sort of, you know, started to catch our breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So we...uh...after... after 2 weeks after 2 weeks, we...uh...we were assembled again and...uh...we were loaded on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were told...we were told that we are going into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which 1s an outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> but we belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , but it's an outside camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Now, we come...we come...we come there and it was at night, and we look...look for the...for the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, but we couldn't see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We went into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you know, and...uh...we went into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and all of a sudden, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> stopped and we seen the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> around, and we knew that this must be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And...uh.. we showed...we embarked from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we were assembled and...uh...the camp inmates came out to see whose there, what's this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And here I see a guy standing there and the guy looks familiar to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So I couldn't do very much because I...I was, you know, far away from...from the...the people, but [...I started...I started to recognize my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So can you imagine it was 4 years after that [...I'm standing in front of my brother and I...after awhile they counted us and they..they gave out the blankets so...for...for the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And then, you know, I went over to my brother and he...he...he didn't recognize me, you know, because I...I was...I was weighted 80 pounds skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But that was my lucky...lucky point you know, because my brother was an old camp inmate there, and he was...uh...in the managing position. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He was again a first aid...uh...person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and...uh...he put me into a good <span class="DLF">block</span> , you know, into a...he seen that I that I have a easy work detail and he managed to give me his bread, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He shortchanged himself, and he gave me another portion of...uh...for the supper, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">In order words, a brother what does he do for brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It's a...it's a natural thing you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And...and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were building a...a <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> , and that <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> was in the...in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you know, was concealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And we are...we are sleeping ourselves into the...uh...into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and...uh... the...the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the...of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was on the...on the bottom on the ground of the...of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">You know, in other words, they dug out a little groove, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I... don't know, 6 feet by 12 feet, whatever it is, you know, and inside they made the little thing for...for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , you know, that you can sleep so you didn't need any...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And they...uh...they...it was...it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that nobody could easily find, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And we worked in that <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> and...uh...time...time seemed that they were normalizing themselves a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And Thank God I felt a little better, and thanks to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And...uh...about ...uh...4 months later or 3 months later or something like that, the American army started to advance towards...uh... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">That's where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> is...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And...uh...they started...there was a rumor. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">At that time I think President Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And...uh...the Germans were talking about, "Now you Jews have nothing to hold you anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The...the President Roosevelt died, you know, and anyways it was a big factor in...uh...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> history that Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The...the war 1s going to change in favor of...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But then all of a sudden we _ again...these...these things always...uh...uh...happen to come up all of a sudden, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There were rumors that they were going to...uh... liquidate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That they going to ship us out into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> , and there they would...uh...put us on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> somewheres and...uh...just liquidate us and we will be just falling over into the deep <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and nobody would know. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So, you know, there's any old saying that I...that I learned it that in the biggest lie, there's always a little bit of truth and sure enough about a week or 2 weeks later, the...we...we were assembled and we were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And we were told that we are going into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So my brother had a good friend that he was together for many years, and we kept ourselves again together and...uh...we....uh...we thought that we...we being shipped out and we were proceeding to the de-embarkation for...on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> and...uh...which we boarded, and we stood all day in that <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and we didn't move one bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So the talk was that the...uh...German railroad is...uh...on the verge of being liquidated by being bombed from the <span class="DLF">air</span> from the English and American air ... airlines...<span class="DLF">airlines</span> ...the Air Force, and the...uh...they...uh...filled...they filled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they get shortage on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Well, we finally started to move, and we moved...uh...very little at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> advanced itself quite a bit in the last couple of hours and we were traveling through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And all of a sudden we were ambushed by...uh... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English fighter planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Now the guards which were on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they started to fear for their lives and...uh... they jumped off the top and they stood under cover having the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in front of them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I said to my brother and to the...the friend, I said, "Look, I don't care what you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We want to be together, but let's make a decision." </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And we decided to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at the first occasion we get. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">That ambush subsided and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move, so in about another 3, 4 hours we were ambushed again, and the guard was off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We had prepared ourselves by opening the <span class="DLF">window</span> where...in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , there's a little...uh...<span class="DLF">window</span> , 2 by 4, whatever it is, and it had one barbed wire across there. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And we managed to...to break that...that wire and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving and we were jumping out, one after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And...and...and that...and that is such a heroic act in my...1n my opinion that we jumped out and nobody broke his bone or leg or whatever it is and we...we assembled together again, you know, and we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Now, at that time the German army was in disarray already. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And they marched...the army marched backward from the <span class="DLF">front line</span> and we marched forward towards the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And this <span class="REGION">area</span> where...was infested with...uh...POWs, French POWs and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And we runned into the German guards and they asked us, "Where we're going? </span><span class="sentence" id="446">What we're doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And we...uh...told them that we are mute and we don't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">We are dumb, deaf and mute, like they say. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And...uh...nobody talked, you know, and we just made with our hands and blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So, but we advanced. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Once we...we stepped a soldier on...on his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">He was dug in...in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">anti-tank</span> ...uh...uh...unit, you know, and he was buried in...not buried, but he was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> , you know, with a...with a...with a gun or with a bomb, whatever he has...uh...for to blow up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> if they come across, and he...uh...and we stepped on...on his head, you know, and we got out of that, and then we walked into a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> that was...uh...uh...full of German soldiers that...that ...uh... liquidated...1 mean not liquidated, but quit the army ahead of time already. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And...uh...we walked in and we seen the <span class="DLF">back door</span> open, and we ran out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I mean it was...it was just going into...into the fire, out of the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">You didn't know exactly which way you...you walked and we prayed to God to guide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And that was...uh...in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And then we walked again and again and we came across a...a...uh...priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And my brother speaks French. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And...uh...he spoke in French with him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Uh...He spoke a broken French, you know, and he asked...we asked him where could we go not...not to be in the middle of the scares, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">He says...uh...
