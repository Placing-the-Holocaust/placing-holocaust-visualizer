ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Let me -- Let me ask you to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">You did a video interview about your experiences during the war --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  -- with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But let’s go back a bit and you’ve talked about this somewhat in that interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Let’s take it back maybe to a couple months before the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">If you could just briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were, where you were, who you were with, and what was happening at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish army and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But I don’t know much about that any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely under real war conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">In September they started dropping the troops in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnum</span> , and since I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fenlow</span> at that time, which isn’t so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops coming over in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and [ll never forget it, because it was just immense. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It -- It was never ending, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , which we later on found out were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> , and that’s really when our liberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And we -- we couldn’t go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> any more and we didn’t have gas and electricity and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And life became very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I was still in hiding of course, and a few very dangerous things happened to my personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that, cause the farmers couldn’t get it, because the man didn’t go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , they- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October, maybe then already, that some Germans came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I was there with my stepfather, who was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , because he was on strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The Dutch government had told all the people who worked for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> that they had to go on strike, so he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And there was a son in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , who was supposed to be working for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So, he was also somewhere hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so I had to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And the Germans said they wanted to look in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they looked in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they decided the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And they sometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my stepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn’t used to doing the housework and all that sort of stuff, so I always went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> early. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So they never saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Course, they were scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And then in December, we were finally liberated, but that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people who lived in our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they had to all go across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Maus</span> , into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then up north, into the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And they wanted all the regular people out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans and the British who were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers at all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The man stayed somewhere, I don’t know where, but we, the women, stayed in a bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there we stayed for a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There was some food, there was water and that’s where we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And it was, of course, still very, very dangerous, because the troops didn’t cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and it was constant bombarding and grenade fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So, we somehow crawled to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then the British decided that they didn’t want us there, so we were evacuated to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and there we stayed til I think the middle of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">In the meantime, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> wasn’t even liberated altogether, so while I was in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name and my -- my father’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then the next day they ask me my mother’s name, and so they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you never talked about it and you never wrote that down. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And they apparently gave that to a Jewish organization who was trying to find all the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then they -- that organization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but -- then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but I didn’t want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow, would find my parents back. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I had no idea where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So, they -- they decided they were going to keep me in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for -- I don’t know how long, maybe they would have taken me forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And then my father, who was hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> first, but later on left for <span class="REGION">northern Holland</span> , somehow got himself involved in underground work. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He was an artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the <span class="REGION">province</span> where he was in, an-and mapped it for the underground and that was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , so that when the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was, and where every little obstacle would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then somehow he was caught by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They came in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to check something. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He and the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were sent to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And thank God my father didn’t reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was Jewish, so he spent a couple of months in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And had they known he was Jewish, they would, of course, have killed him instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But he was liberated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And as it was, the troops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So, when my father came out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , they somehow presented him with a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my maiden name is D’ Ancona, D’A, and when -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , it’s -- the A counts as the main letter, so my name was on top, and my father found out that I was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But then the problem was he was up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , especially in the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no <span class="DLF">roads</span> , there was no public transportation, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, since my father had worked for the underground, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who gave him permission to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> , and you know, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> without tires. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And he came one day to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And well, he knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and we didn’t get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew right away it was my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the Germans and that she had gone away, that she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and after that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Let me just go back for a second --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  The <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you were at in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> --
ANSWER:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  -- who were these people you were with, if your parents were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , were- who were you with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  When I was in hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Well, my par -- we were -- we were -- we all went in hide -- in hiding at same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I was taken by an organization to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and to a family that I had never met in my life, didn’t know the people, and --
QUESTION:  You say an organization, do you know the name of it, or who those people were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is in Dutch, the same as LTD. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And the -- the organization was started by a man, Mr. Debrown, which was not his real name, and he had helpers, young man and young women, who took the kids from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">When - When you were picked up from your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , small children were put in a - sort of what -- what used to be a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and the parents were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in what used to be a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And then, before they went on transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and those children, those young children were taken care of by Jewish people, most likely, I think, nurses, and people who took care of kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And they went out for walks sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And the organization had made it their business to steal some of those children. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, every day when some of those kids were walked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to get a little fresh air, -- and I’m sure that it was prearranged with help <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , that certain children were going to be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So they had as many clothes on as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And then they walked at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , cause there were like maybe 10 or 15 kids, and then at the end, and then those young people came and just stole them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And how they organized getting rid of their papers and -- I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I guess that’s known in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> how it went, but those children were just rescued. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I was still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I was one of the very, very last in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , who lived in their own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that was because we are Sephardic. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My father and my mother both are from Sephardic descent, and the Germans, with all their crazy rules and regulations had, at some point said that most of the Sephardine were going to be descendants from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aranos</span> , which most likely was true, and we were not really Jews, we were Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So, my parents tried everything in the world to get us declared non-Jews, not because they didn’t want to be Jews, but you know, it was important not to have to go to the other side of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I don’t know what -- what my parents knew about what was waiting on the other side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I didn’t know an awful lot, because as much as possible was kept away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But I knew, and everybody knew that, that it wasn’t very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ; in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> still quote quote free, in October of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was practically no Jew left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">There was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more, and there was no organiz -- organized life for Jews any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So, on the 16" of October, my father decided that since we weren’t declared non-Jews, we had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, my father found this organization and they said they would have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So, on mon -- and one morning they came -- and the lady came to pick me up and she took me along to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and there she handed me to a young man, and he took me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with another child that I never saw again, and we traveled a long distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We had to change the pla -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and we took another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Then we finally came at the destined <span class="NPIP">place</span> and this young man said to me, “Well, you just wait here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he took the young man with him and came back maybe three quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that time that I had to wait at that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was like -- like a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It was never ending, and here I was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware of the dangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I had no name, I didn’t know where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was nobody, and if they -- somebody had come up to me and said, “Where are you going, what are you doing, are you waiting for somebody?” </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I couldn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So, I was very, very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And then when he came back, he came on back with a -- with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , so I went with him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he dropped me off at this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And there I stayed for the rest of the year and -- and another year. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I was very, very different from my own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I came from a middle class family, nothing very fancy, but these people, the man was working for the <span class="DLF">railroad</span> , he repaired <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And they were fine people, there’s nothing to s -- be said about them, they were risking their life for me, they knew what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And they were terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But 1t was an altogether different life than what I was used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They were going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> all the time, they read the Bible, they prayed every day and I wasn’t used to that at all, cause my parents were atheist, and -- not that they wanted to deny they were Jewish, but there was absolutely no religion in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and so --
QUESTION:  And these people were not Jewish, that you’re with, or they are?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  No, no, no, they were Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Yeah, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  They were Christians where I lived now. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, everything was different, and of course I- | had just said goodbye to my parents, my father and my mother, and I knew very well that that wasn’t all that sure that I would ever going to see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So, at -- it was very traumatic, and -- but I had to adjust, I had no choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  When you -- When you were in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , with these people that you’d never met before and they’re not from your background, and they’re not from your religion or whatever, but they -- did you realize at the ttme how much of a risk they were taking to --
ANSWER:  Oh, I knew that, yeah, hundred percent, yeah, I knew that if somebody was going to come, that th-the man would most likely be killed, and the son, who was 16 or so at that time, would have had a hard time, too, and maybe the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">You never knew what the Germans were going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But, no, they knew very well what they did, and after the war, I asked them why did you do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And then my stepmother told me that somebody who was sent by one of the clergy in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , came to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and asked if they would take a child, a Jewish child. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And she was willing to say yes right away, but she thought it was prudent to ask her husband if he was thinking the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So, she said, “Well, you have to wait til my husband comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work and I can tell you tonight.” </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So, as it happened, their oldest daughter was going to leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that is very important because in those days, you couldn’t buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , you couldn’t buy linens, you couldn’t buy blankets, you couldn’t buy anything, even if you had the money, it wasn’t available, and so they could only take me if they had a spare <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So when the daughter left, I could take her <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so they told the man who came from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , they could only have a girl, because I could stay with their other daughter in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So that’s how come I found this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or they found the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  And in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where these people who were, at first anyway, are strangers, and they’re [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  It was very strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  I was going to ask you, what was it like to be there? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">How did you act, how did you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Did you feel quickly like part of the family, did you kind of keep to yourself, how did they react? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You know, what was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That’s a strange situation to be in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  It’s -- It’s -- It’s -- It’s an awful situation to be in cause, number one, I was very nervous that I had left my parents, and that this -- this -- this whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was -- was -- you know, it was so different from a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and everything in tha-that <span class="BUILDING">household</span> was different than -- than in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I -- I was -- I’m an only child, so I wasn’t used to brothers and sisters, and once I was settled a little bit, you know, they started to tease me and I wasn’t used to that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I don’t think I’ve cried a lot, because ed -- I knew -- I was old enough to realize that crying wasn’t going to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I knew also that I had to behave myself and that I couldn’t be this spoiled brat and that I had to adjust, because if I didn’t do that, maybe the people wouldn’t want to keep me, and where was I going to go then? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I had nowhere to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And that is the -- an -- an awful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">If -- If they had put me out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I wouldn’t have had any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I was far, far, far away from even non-Jewish friends that I knew, but I had no money, I had no papers, I had -- I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I think that was the scariest part, that I had to really be as perfect as could be, because I couldn’t risk any problems in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so when they teased me I had to take it and they didn’t do that to be mean to me, but they were just used to it and I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The daughter went to a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> , but that was a long walk and there was no transportation at that time any more either. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So, they didn’t want me to risk that big long walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So I had to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and in the beginning I tried to do a little bit of my schoolwork, but my head wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So, my stepmother said, “Well, I didn’t get you in here to be my maid, but maybe it would be a good idea to help me once in awhile.” </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I -- I helped my stepmother with making the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and in those days, everything was breaking, so we had to sew a lot and mend a lot and I’m pretty handy when it comes to that, so I helped and I liked that. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I loved to scrub, so I -- I learned a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I learned a lot of things that my mother never would have taught me, and that came in handy later, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So, I -- I had to do things during the day, cause I was bored stiff otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And so my stepmother and I got along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">When she went shopping, she sho -- most of the time took me along, cause she wouldn’t let me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone, and so we went shopping and -- but there wasn’t much to shop, so we didn’t do that too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And so that was the -- my daily job, to help and do as much as I could to -- to not be a nuisance.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Unreal, unreal. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We -- We -- We didn’t know where my mother had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We knew my mother was caught at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she was in hiding, and after <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I don’t know what else, she ended up in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , in that camp before you go to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And since we had had this stamp in our papers, that we were most likely not Jewish, and merranos and all that sort of stuff, which was like an exemption, my mother had had that in her papers and the Germans didn’t first want to recognize that, but when she was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> with the help of friends who lived there for quite awhile, they recognized that. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So, my mother was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and that was sort of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">show camp</span> for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And that -- My father knew that she had been sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But we also knew, after the war, that not everybody stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and so for the rest, we had no knowledge of what had happened to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My -- My mother came back, though, she told us what had happened, and she did the rounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">She stayed in -- She was caught in July of ’44, which most likely is why she was still alive, because it was sort of at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">She -- She went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and there she stayed for about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And she didn’t talk much about that, but when she did talk about it, she said it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and it was worse than <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They sort of stayed together, 10 Dutch women, and what was the best thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was that if there was a transport to go somewhere else, cause nothing could be worse than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So, one evening, all the people who knew about that there was a transport going, were lining up <span class="NPIP">outside</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And another story goes that everybody who is up front ends up going on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , and the ones who are left over are going to be killed, that they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">However, the Germans liked doing nasty things, so when all those women are fighting and -- and -- and -- and being excited about going away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , were standing 1n <span class="DLF">line</span> , they let them turn around, so the ones who were standing in front were standing 1n the back and the ones who standing in back were standing up front. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That saved my mother’s life, because my mother otherwise would have been in the back, instead of in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Then she was transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lanzing</span> , which was- I guess nobody knows about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And there she had to work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they made rayon for parachutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Very poisonous. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">People who work in that kind of an industry have to get extra food, have to drink a lot of milk, can’t do it more than so many months, I guess, in a year, and there are strict rules, but for Jewish women that wasn’t important, so they didn’t get fed, and they had to work very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They burned their skin and they were nauseous and sick sometimes, because all the poisonous gases and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They -- My mother was fluent in German, and that sort of helped them, too, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">My mother was -- I don’t know ab - if she was -- ca -- you can say she was a boss, but she was a teacher and so she knew how to be ahead of the group, and so she told the Germans off whenever she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And they sabotaged a lot, too, cause if you put your finger on those instruments, then the whole thing messed up, and they ruined I don’t know how much. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And so they were good at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And somehow my mother survived, even though she got very, very ill there. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They operated on her without any anesthesia, any -- any medicine, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And even though the German doctor who did it wanted to kill her, I’m sure, he saved her life, because if he hadn’t done that, I’m sure she would have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So, by the time she was liberated, she was very, very ill, but the Americans took enormous good care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They sent them to <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , they had them x-rayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Everybody who had TB was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">sanitoritum</span> , and the -- the medical staff of, I guess the military, took care of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They stumbled on this group of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Now, my mother was with those 10 -- of which one had passed away, but there were also lots of Hungarian women in that group, and I don’t know where those americ -- the -- where those Americans really took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">My mother talked about flying to, I think <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> , and from there they were transported through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and there they stayed for awhile, and then they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But you have a -- imagine that there was absolutely no normal transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="225"><span class="DLF">Railroads</span> were bombed, and so it was very hard to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> together and th-there wa -- there was no infrastructure whatsoever, so there was no mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">My mother wrote every day and we never got those letters, until months and months later, after she had arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And then when we all three were back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , we didn’t really know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Our business was dismantled, all our belongings were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And somehow my father started again. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He -- He got some help, I think, from the Marshall fund. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">That -- That wasn’t something that they gave you, ee -- it was like loans. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we used to live, we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But we had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , we had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , we had no clothes, and --

QUESTION:  What do -- What do you think was going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Do you think maybe she was depressed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  No, I don’t know, my mother wasn’t depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">No, she -- she was stronger than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">No, she had had typhus in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and I guess she was just so undernourished and so -- had been so sick that it took a long time to recover from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And they had suffered so much, of course, and she never talked about much, cause I’ve a-asked my children about what did Omar ever tell you, and she never talked about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">She never talked about the war, but we never talked about we missed this person, or how sad the way our family came to their end. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It -- It was just a subject that wasn’t touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I guess that it took many, many, many, many years before anybody could talk about it, and realized that we all buried that inside us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Why -- Why do you think you all did that? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Why did you not talk about it, why did you keep it <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">What do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  It was -- It wa -- wa -- It was too awesome, it was too -- too big a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I don’t think anybody could understand it, how it could have happened, why it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It wit - It was so unreal, it was something that nobody wanted to -- to understand, and I think that basically -- I’m not a psychologist, but I think that basically, everybody felt guilty that the -- the few that -- of us who did survive, did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And I still have that myself, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I so many times ask myself, why did I survive and not my very best friend, or m-my very dear cousin? </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It -- It -- It’s such a terrible thing that happened, that it’s -- it’s -- you -- you can’t explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And so I think it was so painful, and it hurted so much, that we just figured, don’t talk about it, and maybe it goes away. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The truth ath -- is that with the years, I think the -- the pain never goes away and you keep on missing those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I -- I -- ’'m fixated with my grandmother, and I was a kid when she died, and I -- I have -- I’ve -- I talk to her in my mind, and I -- I can see her still in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And I -- I -- I just have problems sometimes with why, why did all those people have to be killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They were all honest, hard working, were not in anybody’s way and they were just regular citizens like the rest, and it’s -- it’s some th -- very, very troublesome part of a life, and it- | don’t think it will ever go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I mean, I live a very comfortable life now, and I have- thank God I have -- I have a family, but that pain will never go away, that always comes back somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And, if you live in a -- in a society like we are living here, you realize what you’re missing, too, because people have like school gatherings, you know, they have reunions of their <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And -- And they have family affairs and you see 40 - 50 - 60 people coming, maybe even more, and I have nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I have a cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , and that’s my closest relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And all my uncles, all my aunts, my cousins, they’re all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And maybe they were not my best friends, but that -- that part of your life is so empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And you don’t realize it every second of the day, but you know it’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And if there are happy occasions in your family, you can’t share it with relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Now, thank God, we have good friends here, but it’s still different than your own family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">How do you feel about what -- it’s sort of two questions in one, how do you feel about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And how do you feel about -- I mean, you had one particular experience, how do you feel about the people from your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , from -- people from The <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , not the Jews, but the other people, and how they behaved?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Of all the war, and -- and -- and -- and what they did to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">About the Dutch, I don’t think I feel as strongly a-about the Dutch, as about the Germans, but I know now that the Dutch, as a whole, could have done a lot more, including our queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Queen Wilhemina never talked about anything, not on the -- on the English radio, about stand up against the Germans, try to help your Jewish neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Never, ever that that came about, and they turned to her, then they thought, “Well, it’s too dangerous to help the Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I mean, I was too young to realize all those things maybe then, but when you think about it, when you’re a grown-up and an adult, you wonder why not more people had tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">On the other hand, I know that it was extremely dangerous, because Jewish doctors only could t-take care of Jewish patients and non -Jewish doctors couldn’t take care of non- Jewish -- of Jewish patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Everything was segregated and we had never had that in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was a very liberal country. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">As a matter of fact, my ancestors came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> after the Inquisition, and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> welcomed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It’s -- It’s -- It -- It’s very hard to -- to really judge and to say, well they could have saved more, because everybody knew that if they did help Jews, they would be punished like Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">On the other hand, if lots of people would have stuck together, maybe they would have been able to accomplish more. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> they did a lot more for the Jews than they did in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And it’s -- it -- it -- it sh -- true it wasn’t publicized, I mean, so most of the Jews lived in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , maybe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , and in some s -- all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And the -- the population in -- in the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , might not have known exactly what happened to the Jews, but the masses in -- in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">| mean, part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was cordoned off and nobody could move, and they went <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , an-and picked up the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And 1-it was -- it was a very difficult thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I can’t blame them hundred percent because I know how dangerous it was to help Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">On the other hand, you would have liked to had a little more help from the masses. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And they did it once when they had the strike, when the first Jewish young people were picked up, they had a strike in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , all the municipal workers stopped working and it was a mass demonstration that day, and there was is a monument, [indecipherable] dock worker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , to remind us of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And that was fantastic, but it was one day, and then they went back to work, and the Germans went back to pick up Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So, it’s -- I can’t say that I -- I -- I hated the Dutch people for it, but in hindsight, you could say they could have done a little more for us.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, my husband came from an o-observant home, and I learned, in my hiding days, about religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And so, after the war, I guess I made up my mind that I -- I wanted to marry Jewish, because I thought -- I don’t know if it’s true, but that was in my mind, that somebody who was Jewish, could understand better what went through in my head once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And so that was a hard thing, because most of the people in my age group, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Were very few eligible men. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So, it took me awhile to -- to find the right one, or the right one to find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And so, since his mother is observant, I decided that it was prudent to start out with a kosher home. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And then we, somehow, when the kids grew up, we got more observant, and my husband 1s very observant, I am a little less observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But we keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , and we keep all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And the kids are not that observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We tried to teach them, and it’s up to them now. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They went to <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> , here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">At least they had a good Jewish education, and they know what they don’t want to know when they know what it’s all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And we -- we tried to be an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But it’s hard, it’s hard to be very religious when I know some people all together forgot about religion after the war, others went just to religion to get strength in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">There are always so many questions that it’s -- it’s -- it’s hard, 1t’s hard to believe that everything just was for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I can’t de -- I can’t deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I th -- I can’t believe that was God’s plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But who am I to know?</span></p>
