<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  For the record, will you state your name, date of birth, place of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Louis J. Walinsky, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , April 19, 1908.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  When did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  At the age of four with mother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My father was already here at the time
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, my father had a been a revolutionary in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in his youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Because he was only 16 when he had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He got in trouble with the police for political activity; demonstrations and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> he had any number of jobs: He barbered, he was a weaver of baby carriages, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">But he also became a member of Prince Peter Kropotkin's Anarchist's Circle; and he got involved in journalism and I don't know how many years exactly that he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> before coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He must have come in 1911 -- the family a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">When he got here, as I said, he had been offered a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> so we moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And we were there two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He managed a local union. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My mother had two brothers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who were embroiderers by trade; and they belonged to the? _</span><span class="sentence" id="15">Embroiderers and Pointers Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And they were instrumental in getting that union to offer my father a job managing their local union in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And that is what brought us down from Canad
ANSWER:  Then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I did pretty well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and studied economics, which became my profession later. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I had two or three minor jobs, and then decided to teach <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So I got a teacher's license in economics in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And then, in -- that would have been 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Well, in 1932, a friend of mine who was a great drover, came and said "We ought to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because this guy Hitler is coming to power and it will be an interesting <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I'm going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ; why don't you come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Well, while I was still at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> , I had taken out some insurance policy, so I had a little equity in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I was able to get $500 or $600 on that, and that took me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You have no idea what prices were in those days, but on the German/American Line, travelling -- I think it was called 01:05: "student class"; it was really not very different from steerage -- the round-trip fare was under $200. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I lived very, very frugally; I had to, because I had to stretch that money. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And, well, you got breakfast with your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- that is, a cup of coffee and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And then for lunch and dinner, I would go to the <span class="BUILDING">student house</span> in the <span class="DLF">Aranienburg Strasse</span> where you had two choices, I believe it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">You had an Eintopfgericht, a stew; or you had soup and a stew. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And for one, you paid 60 pfennigs; that was 15 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But the other, you paid a mark; that was a quarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And the system was: You could get a second on the soup and a second on the vegetable, but not on the meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So you would go with a friend and you would get your meal, the soup and the dish, and you would eat the soup fast and the vegetable, and your friend would go off and get the second, the refill. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And then you would have -- well that was 25 cents and two ate on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And in the evening, you'd go to the automat where they had a very, very hearty bean soup that cost maybe 40 or 50 pfennig; and so those were the meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Obviously, I wasn't 01:05: spending very much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">One thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in those years, there were student rates on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">metro</span> equivalent -- at the film, <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , opera; so you could go very, very cheaply. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Anyway, you know, very soon, late in 1932, the Nazi business became quite tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And some of my friends, Germans, were extremely concerned because they felt vulnerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And there would the Nazis be out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> shaking their collection boxes Einweg nach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , oneway to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I was at a student ball in the <span class="BUILDING">Reichsgarten</span> the night of the Reichstag fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">When I came out at about 1:00 a.m. that night, it was very strange; there were policemen all around the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I asked one, I said "What's happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And he said "There's been a fire in the Reichstag." </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I looked down, because it was in plain view down at the end of that walk, there were no signs of external fire damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So whatever fire there had been, it was strictly internal. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But of course when the press came out and Goebles made a story out of it, you'd think the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had been burned down; and this was not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Anyway, that was a little background to the DP thing that came later, you know; that eight months or so in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And after the election -- the elections were in March and early in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And Hitler was confirmed; he had already been in the Reichstag seated. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I had run out of money, and my father refused to send me any. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He thought it was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to get out of. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I didn't feel I was in any danger, and I don't think I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But I did run out of money and I had to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you can tell me about your eight months in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the change of the mood of the people or ...
ANSWER:  Yes, a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was a landlady of my friend who said, "You know there have been five major elections in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in one year, and not one of them succeeded in creating a majority government?" </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And that was one factor in what happened later, because people gave up on the democratic process; it wouldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But I've never seen that mentioned as an element contributing to Hitler's coming to power, and I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Anyway, how did I get there? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was on a train of thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Well, I was asking you a little bit about the mood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at that time and anti- Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So this lady, this Wirtin, the Hausfrau, the landlady, she said she was voting for Hitler because after Hitler, the communists would come and that's what she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I thought this was a strange prognosis -- psychology. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But I initially had <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with the widow of a professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So she was Frau Doctor Professor Resica (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="69">and a very German lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I subsequently took a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a Jewish family, and I was with them until March, when things had already become quite bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They had no intention of leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They didn't think it was necessary; they didn't think they ought to run or had to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They were German, so -- anyway it's not easy to recall all of it, but there's enough to make it a very tense and dramatic experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Was there a palpable sense of the anti-Semitism, of restrictions against people in those days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Well, no, the more open expressions of anti-Semitism -- the badge, the tagging of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and so on, that mostly came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There wasn't much of that in the first months; and don't forget, I was out by March of '33.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Were you there during the book burning; was that during that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  I don't remember if that came then or shortly after.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  The other thing I wanted to ask you about your family background: Was your family very conscious of being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I grew up on a <span class="DLF">Bronx street</span> , <span class="DLF">176th Street</span> ; and our side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> was all Jewish, the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> was all Irish. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We kids did not play with one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We just -- they were there we were here and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So my family's friends were all Jewish, and the only Gentiles really I knew as a boy growing up were our teachers at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  Well, as a union leader, my father was a great activist. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Then he was also a meagerist(?); </span><span class="sentence" id="87">and he liked to dramatize and he liked to play a public role, be a public figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And his union was not big ,and it didn't have a very large treasury, but he could always could come up with a $5,000 donation here or a $10,000 there toward the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , let's say of a -- toward the purchase of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for YVO -- you know, the Yiddish Research Institute -- or to make a gift to the Urban League or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he was a very popular speaker, always invited to speak at banquets and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So he wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very much, but by the same token, we knew of his activities and this was part of the milieu.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  The reason why I was asking was to try to get a sense of if your background prepared you or motivated you for some of the work that you did later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Well, my first real job after the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was <span class="BUILDING">teaching school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I taught at the Abraham Lincoln High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And it was a new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with a very enterprising principal who had organized a great faculty. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And the student population was, I suppose, 80 percent Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We had a few Blacks, and we had some Catholic children. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But in those days, the Teachers Union was a very active organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And actually, the communists tried to take it over from <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And so the less inclined split off and O1:17: formed the Teachers Guild. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so that was also a part of a social milieu, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I was with the Teachers Guild. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I was also, in those years, trying to write plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I wrote one play about Hitler's coming to power which was published but not produced. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I wrote a number of other plays in the thirties after I had returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And you know, I wanted to be a playwright, but I couldn't make it to Broadway; and so at a given point, I said to myself "You can't do both things. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">You've got to pick one or the other." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And so I decided to stay with teaching and I gave up play writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But I had a play produced in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , a dramatization of Aldus Huxley's "Brave New World." </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But then, the war came and I had the opportunity to join the War Production Board, which I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  In what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  This is in '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I was with the War Production Board into its demise early in 1947; and that was a great experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It didn't have anything to do with Jewishness or Jewish causes or whatever, but I made the acquaintance for example of Lucius Clay who represented the Army at the Requirements Committee in the War Production Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> later for the ORT I went to see him, and he received me very graciously. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We spent 70 minutes together. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And it ended with his giving our organization access to those <span class="DLF">enemy supply dumps</span> , which was an important element in equipping our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , which were pretty barren at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  What were your responsibilities with the War Production Board?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  The War Production Board had a Program Committee and it had 01:20: the industry divisions which were operational -- steel, copper, paper, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The operating divisions were run by people from industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The Program Committee had responsibility for reviewing the proposals made by those operators. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we were largely academic. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So I was taken on as the pulp and paper specialist, because there was that opening. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I knew nothing about pulp and paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">When I was offered that assignment to start, let's say, two weeks from then, I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and lived in the <span class="BUILDING">New York Library</span> for a couple of weeks and studied pulp and paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And so I became an instant expert, as a lot of us did in those days in the War Production Board, and in the Government, generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So for most of time, that was my beat. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But towards the end, I got more responsible assignments; because I became head of the Research and Analysis Group, which covered all the work of the program people. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And so that got me into steel and copper and oil and any number of other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we had an interesting arrangement at the War Production Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">U.K.</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> had a Combined Raw Materials Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And the people in my group, our program committee types, 95 percent of our work was on the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> but we also served as U.S. staff to the Combined Raw Materials Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And we had toward the end a Combined Pulp and Paper Committee, on which I served as executive secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And after VE Day, but before VJ Day, I was one of a 01:23: commission of two sent to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.K.</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to line up paper supplies for the <span class="REGION">liberated areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had an important national election coming up and they didn't have any paper for posters and voting materials; and I earned an undying love from one of my French colleagues for getting them 20,000 tons of paper for those elections. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Why am I doing all of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">This has nothing to do with the ORT.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Well, I was just trying to get some background. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Although actually, what you're talking about right now seems to me to be some training for all of the logistics and procurement that you got involved with for the Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Why don't you tell me how you got to ORT from War Production Board.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Well, it was through my father, who was a friend of Louie Boudine (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="141">who was one of three grand old men of the ORT and chairman of the American ORT Federation. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He had already, starting in '46, had more than a little difference of opinion with Lubovitch (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="143">and Singalovsky (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="144">the two European chiefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And he had won a vote to create a financial and accounting office for the ORT in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , where there would be some control over the numbers and statistics, so when the American ORT went to the Community Funds and foundations for grants, they'd be able to demonstrate what they had done with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Because he couldn't up to that point; he couldn't get the data out of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So he asked my father for some help. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And my father persuaded me to go see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And so our understanding was that I would come to the ORT for a limited period of time to set up this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and get it going. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So that's how I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on <span class="DLF">72nd Street</span> next to Broadway. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I had got that under way two or three months only, but it was already rolling when -- I guess Boodine mostly, but others in the American ORT became concerned about the way things were going in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where they feared the program would collapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And in their view everything depended on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So they asked me to go over and take responsibility for the operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , U.S. Zone and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="REGION">British Zone</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Let me just stop you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Why was there so much concern about the European operations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Well, Dr. Lubovitch, who had started the work of the -- not started the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He got the organization there, but Jacob Olaseky (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="159">who had been a director of ORT in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kowno</span> before the war on his own steam and initiative, he had started an <span class="BUILDING">ORT school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> where he was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And then he got some of his former friends who were in other areas to start training operations there; but they were scrounging, they were barefooted and bare-knuckled, and they had no outside support at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Lubovitch came into that situation, you see, and "all right, here's the ORT, I'm the ORT." </span><span class="sentence" id="162">and made all sorts of commitments and promises of supplies and funds; and in order to help hiring instructors, they were promised -- you know the marks they would be paid were meaningless. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The cigarettes they would be given would help. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But the important thing was the few pounds sterling per month they were promised upon completion of their service in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when they came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Well, already in 1947, some people were coming out and they would come to an <span class="BUILDING">ORT office</span> , whether it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and say "I'm so-and-so; I had so many months of service with ORT; you owe me so-and- so many pounds." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But the people had no documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They had never been notified that nowhere was there a list of people who had been made that commitment and what their service had been and what they were entitled to. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So some of these stories were already getting around, and it had elements of scandal. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So that was one of the things that really terrified the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They were already not in very good odor with the Community Funds all around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because they hadn't been able to supply them with data on how many courses, where, how many students, what -- and so they felt pretty low before this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And as I suggested earlier or hinted earlier, Boodine was already into some kind of feud with Singelovsky and Lubovitch, and he was really determined to break their -- what he thought was a death grip on the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Is there a way to sum up what the basis for the feud was; is it too complicated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Well, neither Lubovitch or Singelovsky had any administrative capabilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">What records they had were little slips of paper or chits in this pocket or that pocket; but no books, no sense of organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">In presenting data requested by our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , this new financial and accounting office which we had to turn over to the AJDC budget -- I didn't mention that in '47, ORT had always raised its own funds; not very successfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But in '47, they made an agreement with the American Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">The AJDC would give us a subvention of $2 million a year to the ORT in return for which ORT would refrain from any attempted individual fundraising. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Well, the material that came from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Geneva offices</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">AJDC</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on request was just -- "never, never land"; and pitiful, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And then there's a third element which was personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">You know, in the course of my, I guess it was two and a half years I suppose, with the ORT at different times in a personal conversation with Dr. Singelovsky said: Iam the ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Ina personal conversation with Lubovitch, he said: Iam the ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And finally, to my surprise, in a personal conversation with Louie Boodine, he said: I am the ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So here you had these three egos. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">All of them old men, Lubovitch ill, Louie Boodine nearly blind- but a bulldog; and he was determined to wrest what he thought was their death grip or chokehold on the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> operation pretty controversial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Which?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  When you were in Europe...
ANSWER:  The financial and accounting office?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Did the Europeans react to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Singelovsky, chiefly, he sabotaged it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But of course, I started out -- I think I made a mistake at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I should have gone over and gotten acquainted personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Instead of which, I sat there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I dreamed up these beautiful reporting forms, you know -- financial and educational -- and developed a system where they would go out and they would come tn a certain way and the information would be collated and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And Singelovsky wasn't happy with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And then quite soon, I told you I was sent over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to take over there, operationally. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I got a friend to take over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And while I don't think I was terribly politic, he was certainly less so. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And both Singelovsky and Lubovitch couldn't abide him. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They thought he was arrogant. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But -- he was trying to do a job, but not in a terribly sensitive way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  So you were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ; where were you sent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was the headquarters of the USO, and it had had its own turmoil. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">There had been a conflict between Jacob Olaseky, who's the real hero in this whole thing, and the Westerners who had been sent in by Lubovitch to oversee the operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Olaseky was a DP. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He had no face or status with the IRO or the U.S. military. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The liaison with them was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Lubovitch knew that so he sent him people thinking they would play that role, but they would not attempt to interfere with the management of the actual training operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Well neither of the people he sent in took it that way; they wanted to boss Olaseky. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He wasn't having it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And so things there were also not very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Well, the first time I was introduced to Olaseky, George Bacca (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="213">was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And he was the president of the American ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I forget who else, maybe it was Lubovitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And Olaseky. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And it was plain that Olaseky was resentful. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He was another mischief-maker, another outsider. "</span><span class="sentence" id="219">I've done all of this work; whatever is here, I've made without help, and now you're going to..." So when I saw how this was going I said to Jacob, "Let's you and I step out of this meeting and have a word with one another." </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And when we were alone, I asked him, "What really is your problem here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="222">He said, "I have been the director in the <span class="REGION">U.S. Zone</span> and I cannot lose face by having someone coming in over me." </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I said, "What's your proposed solution, then?" </span><span class="sentence" id="224">He said, "Let the ORT appoint you to be director for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ; then I can be under you, but I still am the chief in the <span class="REGION">U.S. zone</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I said "wonderful." </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And from then on, we never had a spat or difficulty of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  In terms of how all these different groups worked together when you went over there, and you know was the UNRRA with the IRO at this point, maybe? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">During that period the UNRRA became IRO but it the same organization, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  How did ORT work with all these organizations over there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Well, we didn't have very much to do with anyone except the joint -- the AJDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We had some important business to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You know, it was the joint who gave supplementary rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Supplementary rations were very important for us to be able to offer our students who were doing manual work in the <span class="BUILDING">metalworking shop</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">woodworking shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So one the things was to get the joint to classify students as being eligible for supplementary rations, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Another thing was: It was a big organization, you know; they had a very large staff in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">01:40: They had all sorts of warehousing and supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And I was able to arrange with them where they had supplies that we needed and could use, for them to make them available to us and charge it off against our subvention, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So that sort of thing was the relationship with joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But we had nothing to do with other NGO's, or other voluntary organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  What about the US Military, did you work with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  I told you of the thing with Clay after that 1t would be up to our district directors to work with the military guys in charge of their <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We didn't have to much to do them actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But we had a certain number of our people in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And the uniform was important because it entitled us to -- well, it entitled the wearer to mess privileges, to PX privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The PX privileges was awfully important. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">You could buy a carton of cigarettes at the PX for eighty cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">That was worth 1,500 dollars in the equivalent Marks on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So you know, this was important trading. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And there were guys who made full use of that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The guys --
QUESTION:  For themselves? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">A.Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  For themselves or for themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  For themselves; for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">One American I brought over I known as a specialist in - what would be the term -- what would be the term? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">In testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  2? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">What sort of administrative hurdles did you have as director of these organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  You mean on the spot in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  You got over there and you found a system in place which didn't appear to very organized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  What did you find? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">What were you able to do to improve that problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  Well, I think the first thing was to develop some hard facts on what we needed by way of equipment and supplies from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and to initiate the actions that would bring the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Another was to organize or supervise procurement within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There, there were two things: There was the Army helping us; and the other was purchasing with cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We bought Italian lathes that were worth twelve thousand dollars for twelve cartons of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">You know, so you could -- and when you imported those at eighty cents a carton and you had thousands of cartons a month allowed you as incentive goods for your instructors and students, you could go a long way with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So cigarettes were good currency.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Was this a legitimate process or was this --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  -- did you improvise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  I think it was in the atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Everyone had been doing it before I got there, I did not invent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And as a matter of fact, when sometime later on a disgruntled colleague went after Olaseky, he wanted to bring him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And he reported to the IRO that the ORT under Olaseky was black marketing and keeping two sets of books. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Well, they came after Olaseky. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I said no, I will go to meet your invitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It's not for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I think the <span class="BUILDING">IRO headquarters</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , if I'm not mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">When I came there, they told me there were these charges against Olaseky. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I said "of course." </span><span class="sentence" id="281">You mean you -- you acknowledge you have two sets of books? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I said "of course." </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They said, well -- I said, but look ,if you want to come after me, you have to go for the Joint, you have for the Red Cross, you have for the Church World Service, we are all doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Because we have got to stretch our means to meet our needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">That was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So -- well, that was an administrative hurdle of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But that kind of thing there was plenty of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Are there other examples you can give of the creative procedures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  How you were able to stretch human end resources to make your work effective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  Well, I think I mentioned the chief ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">In addition to the subension (ph) from the Joint, much of which was to finance the work of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , the Women's American ORT -- the Ladies' ORT -- they were prohibited from raising funds, as such; but they could have value-received functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And they raised some money that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They came and got around and looked and tried to be helpful and contributed here or there with -- toward various projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  For example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  Well, like providing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for Olaseky, so he could have transportation; things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  What other problems did you spot when you went over there that needed to be corrected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  Supply, I think, was the first and most basic. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Organizing the courses of instruction; because they been very al fresco. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They had initially been left to the artisans who took responsibility for running the course; but these courses had to be developed and organized and more standardized and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We had to develop an inspectorial staff who would go round and check out and make suggestion and try to give superintendency. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We had a transportation problem of some seriousness, because we were spread all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Means of transportation were -- you know, you didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So we needed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> for our district directors and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  Has you question been recorded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  No, but it doesn't need to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Well, I have been -- I've been trying to state, I think, all along what the general and particular situations were that we had to face and how tried to cope with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you can think of; you mentioned different areas of professional training, supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">What about, did you have focus at all on the living conditions for the DPs, or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  The chief thing on that had to do with the supplementary rations for the students; and that I have already been onto. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We also, you know, gave -- I forget, now, how many -- but at least a few cigarettes each week to the students, and more to the instructors. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And these were a very important part of their compensation. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But the supplementary rations was really a most important factor in the students’ well-being and their interest in continuing the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">You know, already, late in '47, I suppose it was, we were getting visiting delegations from <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> considering opening immigration to DPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="315"><span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> were particularly interested and open. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">The people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> knew that when they were interviewed as candidates, to be able to say they had a skill or show they had a skill or show a diploma of proficiency was a very important element in their being accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So that was one of our big inducements. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And these other things, the rations and cigarettes, were perhaps as important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  What did you think was your biggest challenge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  I don't know whether this is challenge, but my greatest difficulty was, in a way, mediating between the Americans and the Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">This had nothing to do with the training operations in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But it involved all sorts of things periodic meetings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ; flying back in mid-winter to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for a critical meeting when the American ORT was ready to cut off transfers of funds to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Paris offices</span> and wanted me to be the hatchet man, and serve as the president's deputy and do the money control myself, which I refused to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But that was a very trying and tense and distasteful part of the job; but unavoidable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  Did you have a sense that the European ORT program and the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in various <span class="REGION">zones</span> were administered differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  I don't get your question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Well, I am wondering if, for example, in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , where clearly there was more of a different kind of interest in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and in training and all of that, whether they allowed the same amount of democracy and choice as in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">US Zone</span> , where I think we were much more eager to prepare people for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Who's we?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  The <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ; the American ORT; no?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I don't think the American ORT people the Board, were hot Zionists, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  I just thought maybe that the British-run camp might have a different interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But maybe not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  There weren't enough of them to have significance from a policy point of view anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Did any of this bickering between European and the Americans ORT organizations translate into the vocational program? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Did they affect that at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  Not in terribly significant ways, but one instance that come to mind was, not long after I had been there, I had put the whole organization to work to develop a list of requirements, how many of this, that and the other machines do you need in your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zone</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And this was a painstaking operation in which the whole organization participated. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And when it was done and I had reviewed and I done some pruning, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> for a meeting with Dr. Singelovsky and Dr. Lubovitch, and we arrived at an understanding of how much this thing would cost -- his engineers there did the estimating -- and who would what. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Singelovsky undertook to do a significant part of the procurement. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Well, it turned out months later he hadn't done a damned thing about that part of the procurement. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Well that was an effect; that affected the pace and progress of the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But he was not a killer diller. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  What was the general philosophy behind the ORT training in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  You're confident there must have been one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Wondering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Well, you know the ORT got founded originally in response to a widespread belief that the Jew was a Luftmensch you know; an air person, feet off the ground, not a down-to-earth, productive person. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And in a way the thought was, through acquiring a skill and being an artisan, the Jew would demonstrate that this was a canard; it was not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">He was normal like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I don't know how much philosophy there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">There was job to done. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There were these people who were there waiting for a chance to emigrate who were idle; who had to have some constructive occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It was natural <span class="NPIP">place</span> and setting for Olaseky to undertake what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It was natural for the ORTs to see a great challenge and opportunity to go in there and make a real program out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He could not have gone very far by himself without the means. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But I don't know that this adds to a philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Opportunity, obligation, community. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">There was great sympathy in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for the people for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And you know, you don't give a man fish; you give a rod and line and teach him how to fish to support himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  How large of an effort was the ORT operation at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  We got up to something like ninety training instillations; something like ten or eleven thousand students/enrollees; and something like a thousand employees, of whom about seven hundred would have been instructors and the others would be support staff of one kind or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And I think that's about where it peaked. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">When I came in early in '47, we had in the <span class="REGION">U.S. Zone</span> about forty-five hundred people -- enrollees; and four hundred-odd staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But it was growing very rapidly, and by the 02:05: end of the year it was up to eight thousand students and seven hundred-odd staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I think, you know, for the first year, the people, the DP's, didn't really know what was happening and what was likely to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But then it became obvious that immigration was not going to be tomorrow; and it soon became obvious that they would need a skill or demonstrable skill. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">That would be important factor in their being accepted for emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So this is why they started coming in in much larger numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And --
QUESTION:  Were the courses specific to any particular <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or <span class="NPIP">destination</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They had no way of knowing where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Remember in '47, this was before the creation of the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">It was still <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and the Brits were still very, very restrictive on admitting immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Also sorts of tragic incidents of which you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Did the immigration authorities you would work with from time to time, they were looking for --
ANSWER:  I had no occasion to --
QUESTION:  -- metalworkers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  I had no occasion to --
QUESTION:  You said they were coming through from --
ANSWER:  Yes, they were; they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And they visiting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and interviewing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And I don't- I don't know that -- that say, <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> at any given time had in mind a concentration on metalworkers or machinists or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They were looking people, though, who could become productive and self-sustaining.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  What kind of courses were given?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  I showed you that long list you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Well, give me a since of the range.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Well, metalworking, carpentry, woodworking, mechanics, radio mechanics, electricians, dressmaking and millinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We had some in dental assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  How do you -- how did people -- how did the organizations decide what sorts of courses to offer; was there any plan?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It was opportunistic in terms of the skills that were found there among the DP's. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">People who would be competent to transmit a skill. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And so that became the basis for a course. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">02:09: Now, there 1s something else I didn't say earlier and is an important element here: '46, '47, '48, people wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">They wanted a chance to immigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">If you offered a course, let's say, that would be a two-year course of training in something, no customers; one-year course, no customers; three months, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So you'd start off with a three-month course in metalwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">When that was concluded and nothing had happen on the <span class="REGION">immigration front</span> , you organized a sequel to it, another three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And that was how - but they were all short courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They had to be; that was the psychology. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">People would not commit themselves, couldn't commit themselves to a more prolonged stay when they didn't -- that was not what they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Could people choose whatever course -- whatever kind of study they wanted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">If 1t was being offered, if there was an instructor to give it and there was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  And were the opportunities different for men and women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Well, they'd be different -- different courses of study, but the opportunity were there for everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Helena Volcalvich (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="404">who subsequently became Helena Olaseky, she was in charge of all the women's courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">She is an admirable, highly competent, attractive woman and she did a great job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  So there women courses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  But all programs would have been open to anybody who --
ANSWER:  Yeah, but I don't think we had men going for dressmaking or millinery; and we had very few girls signing up for woodworking or metalworking. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Auto mechanics, that was what I didn't mention before that was quit popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  Was there any effort to meet educational standards or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  That was coming in later ,say toward the end of '48 and then in '49, it became -- it became -- it raised standards to a degree that impressed Franklin Keller, who had been a long-time principal of a vocational training high school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and who 1s there as a specialist for the Army, and our French Dr. Frankel who had a life time of experience in vocational training. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They were much impressed with the level that had been achieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But it happen very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Who did most of the teaching in the training? </span><span class="sentence" id="415">02:13:
ANSWER:  DP's. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">DP's who had been artisans, craftsmen; very few had been pedagogues. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But in some of the more recent technologies like radio mechanics, electricians, we didn't have very many among them the DP population and we hired Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  Did that work out pretty well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Well, it apparently it worked all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It jolted me when I first got exposed to it; I couldn't -- I think I mentioned to this to you on the way here: When I was taken for the first time introduced to a German instructor and he held out his hand, I couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But my host, Jacob Olaseky, who had been liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , he had no problem fraternizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Another time I didn't mention this earlier, we had been out on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and it was time to stop for meal, and Olaseky and I went in to eat, he invited the driver to come with us, the driver who was a German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  Did you think that that was indicative of the general attitude _?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I don't think it was general. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I told you another story of a very different kind of Gordon who wanted me let him to qualify to drive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , because he wanted to find a crowd of Germans and run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So the feelings 02:15: were mixed to the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  What about training facilities; where were all these <span class="BUILDING">installations</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Well, they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">residential community</span> where the DP's gathered in the given <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and there was always a camp committee, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to allocate <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And some were more generous, some were more desirous of helping and doing everything they could; and others were not so interested and not so benign 1n the facilities they provided; but that is how it went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Did you ever need to coordinate with or use German facilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Not to my knowledge, but I would not have been involved with that sort of thing very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  Or what about programs at <span class="BUILDING">German factories</span> , anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I know about those only as they were described to me, but I -- I never found time to go and see one of those things in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  But just for the record, there was training in <span class="BUILDING">German factories</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  I don't know if you'd call it training. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">It was the equivalent. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">What happen was that often, our people in their institutions didn't have the materials necessary for the training; and these would be consumables like textiles, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">If you're going to make dresses, you need yardage. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But if you don't have the goods, then what do your kids do? </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And sometimes in a class, you have a one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> and 15 pupils. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">This was early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So improvising, our people at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> made arrangements occasionally for some of our students to work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> as juniors or assistants or whatever, so they would get some training that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But this is really learning by doing, more -- vocational training 1s learning by doing anyway, but a -- taking part in a production process would not develop an artisan, it would train in a particular 02:18: operation rather than a general skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Were there efforts to provide psychological support or social services as well at some of the <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  I brought in one guy from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> who had taken a doctorate in guidance. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And I thought he could make a real difference and I thought we needed such a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But there was an unhappy outcome there. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He hadn't been very long on the spot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> when it was reported to me that he was in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">He had been to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he was caught at the <span class="DLF">borders</span> smuggling silver ingot. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So I had no recourse; I had to put him on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I had to get him out of there or otherwise he would have gone to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">That was the end of vocational guidance specialist program.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  A lot of these displaced persons needed all kinds of counseling and psychological support, doctors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  Well, maybe they did, but I don't think they got it from the ORT in any formal way. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It would've been truly incidental to the major activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  Would you say that the real enthusiasm for the training is being given?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  I don't know how to answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I visited a certain number of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and training operations briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I found them busy, active. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I think the trainees were interested in what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I think they found it valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I think their instructors were doing there best to be helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But when you ask about enthusiasm, I don't know -- I don't know how to answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">These people have been, I think, too recently bruised to be very enthusiastic about anything, including life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  There was a commitment to --
ANSWER:  There was a future. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">That was their objective: To qualify for and make possible the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I don't think "enthusiasm" is the right word.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  Do you think that the operation was largely successful, from your experience; from what you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It was very, very far from perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It was certainly less than ideal, but considering the circumstances, the difficulties, the obstacles and everything else that went with the beast, I think one could take satisfaction in the accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Were there certain programs that were more successful than others, in terms of job skills or...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  I don't know how to answer that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  The DP's, themselves, who seemed to enroll in these courses? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">02:23: Is there any demographic breakdown to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  By demographic breakdown, you mean age groups, for example, sex?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  Age, Sex, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  Well, I suppose mostly youngish people and young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">As many women as men, surely. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Some youngsters and a few older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">It was a mixed --
QUESTION:  Did a lot of these people come with prior job skills?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Well, the younger ones would not have had many job skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">They wouldn't have had the opportunity to develop them. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The job skills were among our instructors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  What was general morale like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  I think it varied. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It varied with the same people from month to month. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">You know, it wasn't -- I told you that there were an awful lot of big bellies among the women because, it seemed, after experiencing all that death and observing all that death and losing so much family, everyone wanted to produce a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And the women were getting pregnant as fast as they could and hoping.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Did that pose any special problems or challenges?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  You mean the pregnancies? </span><span class="sentence" id="496">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">That was very welcomed. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It was a sign of health and invigoration in what had been a horrible down, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And the women who had already produced a young one were so happy and doted on them and --
QUESTION:  Was this more of a thing the camp administration had to deal with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Well, I think, in terms of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> administrations, I imagine there was quite a disparity of manner, quality, interests, humanity; and adressed it very much with the individual commander how those things were done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  Were there a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that you spent most of your time at?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  No, I was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And as it turned out, I soon became involved in a triangular run from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ; because that inner conflict within the ORT, by 1948, I hadn't been there quite a year, the Americans insisted that as part of the solution to that organization or crisis, or so they conceived it, that I be designated as Secretary General of the World ORT Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So I had to take that on on top of, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ; and it meant that I had to spend a certain amount of time at the <span class="BUILDING">Paris headquarters</span> and I had to spend a certain amount of time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> back when it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singelovsky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I didn't -- I didn't really give the DP operation the full attention it needed, because I didn't -- I had these other things thrust on top of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  I don't recollect talking about a rift. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">When the State was inaugurated, early in '48, the Jewish Agency from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , the Sochnut, became very active in organizing an Alyah and they did the rounds of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- and the response was very strong; it was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Because immigration to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had not really opened up in a big, significant way. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So it was clear that 02:29: most of the DPs would be finding their way to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And so that became the point of concentration. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And because of that, you know, I started, without authorization, shipping machine equipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> so it would be there when people got there, and we could have the training operation essentially shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And that's what did happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  How were you able to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  (Laughs) We loaded the machinery on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and sent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  It was that simple?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  Well, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I had a -- I had a very good supply man who made the arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I think, actually, our stuff went by rail through <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and was put on board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  This was all through ORT channels?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I think -- well, we were ORT, weren't we? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Singelovsky opposed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">He did not see a future for ORT in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">He thought the future of ORT was in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And when he learned that I had already initiated this program of shipping are machines to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he had me called to a meeting of the executive committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , and put me on the carpet for this unauthorized action, which I naturally defended. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And the decision of that committee at the end of the meeting -- and these were his people -- I mean, his -- Swiss and other French and other friends who are on the executive -- the end of that meeting, the upshot was he was instructed to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and start the work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He didn't win that one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  How important were the ORT activities there in terms of providing a base for future <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  Well, this a question that's germane to the DP operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">02:32: It's not germane to the very scanty training there was in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.K.</span> or the somewhat larger training that took place in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It was -- or <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It was the DP population. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And there it was most significant, because here came large numbers of skilled artisans who were the instructors and administrators, and trainees, who had developed from minimum to pretty decent skills in their chosen occupations. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And then, of course, the training got underway very quickly in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because the ORT operation grew rapidly, because Olaseky went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And this man was a dynamo. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Actually, he's the man who saved the ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And so whereas Lubovitch and Singelovsky and Boodine all thought that they were ORT, he was really the ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">He was the heart and the soul and the dynamo. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I ended up loving this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">He's a marvelous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">But you know what he told me once, though? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It's very distressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">He said, "Louie, the best people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We who survived were not the best people." </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And you know what he meant? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The people who stole other people's rations, you know, who really managed at the expense of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And the abnegating, the gentle, the kind, the good; they're the ones who did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And he felt this very, very strongly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  What made him so effective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Imagination, energy, creativity. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It's hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">One of the things I gave to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> a few years ago was a book about him that was done after his death which 1s composed largely of testimonials of any number of people; a small one from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And so they show a number of facets of this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But just -- just bursting with energy and creativity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Now, we're talking about the role of the DPs and the training in Europe and providing a foundation for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Is there anything more that you want to add there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I think that's -- that's the -- that's an element which I think is significant, that made a significant contribution to the early growth of the State, helped provide a foundation for its economy and enabled the newcomers to contribute to the building of the State. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And maybe the most important thing that came out of the DP experience was that contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  And I'm not sure I want to inflict them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  But I must tell you my experience with the ORT was my first experience with a Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I had a subsequent one with the World Jewish Congress, another connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And I thought, among the so-called leadership -- not only the triumvirate whose names came up so often earlier -- but, you know, members of the executive, members of the leadership ranks; a good deal of the motivation was that of personal ego, rather than, you know, the desire to do a good work. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And this is not very --
QUESTION:  How's it going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  What's, you know -- that --
QUESTION:  Maybe you can address it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It's a reflection, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But it's the human condition too, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  How do you personally feel about going over there as a Jew and the work that you were able to accomplish, or what you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  I felt very good about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I was grateful for the opportunity to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It didn't turn out to be unalloyed pleasure, as I've indicated more than once. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But I thought it was an opportunity to render service; and I was glad to do it, thankful for the opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Some years -- many years later, World Jewish Congress created an International Economic and Social Commission to try to anticipate some of the results of the desired peace in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We became really an inquiry into the status of the issues facing world Jewry and, particularly, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to the Diaspor
ANSWER:  And I had a wonderful commission, some great people on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But I had to carry the ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And I was very grateful for the opportunity to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  When you went over to Europe in '47, and you took a look at the situation -- not just the ORT situation, but the general DP situation, was it -- was it what you expected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Because it was so personalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">You know, it wasn't ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olaseky</span> , it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubovitch</span> , it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singalovsky</span> , it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boudine</span> , it was clashes, it was this, 1t was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So- it really took one off -- you know, the golfer says you come off the shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Do you play golf?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  A little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Well, you come off the shot, and you spoil it. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But it's lifting your body away instead of going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Well, in any activity, there's a danger of coming off the shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And there was a lot there to take you off the real shot, which was the DP training operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview </span>
