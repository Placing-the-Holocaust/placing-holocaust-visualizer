<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father’s outlook on life influenced your personality, and your thinking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don’t want to magnify it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was very moved by my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair later on, when the Holocaust came. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother’s social skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , and her desire for me to be somehow -- I don’t know, something very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">But it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Later they divorced; when I was in my late teens, they divorced. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But it was an unhappy <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and I’m not sure that I -- I mean, I think I had a good role model for my future in human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I’m not sure that I had a good role model in terms of relationships, and 1n terms of parenting. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I learned, though, as a -- as an only child in an unhappy <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I learned how to compromise. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And these, I think, are skills I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And that comes not only from later experience, but I learned it in the <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  You -- you spent your teenage years, I believe, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Tell me about what that experience was like, and -- and how you think now, looking back, that it affected you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What can I say about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">In some ways, it was almost -- it’s crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear of be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans came, specially chosen for annihilation. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing incident, when I was fire watching in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central London</span> , when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central London</span> was terribly bombed, and was buried, albeit it -- it -- 1t wasn’t as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn’t hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to go downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a <span class="BUILDING">solicitor’s office</span> , and standing on some <span class="DLF">steps</span> , going down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where all the documents were kept with little bits of pink ribbon tying them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I was going -- there was only about four or five steps, but as I stood on the top step, the <span class="DLF">steps</span> collapsed under me. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from that time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my chances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn’t being particularly chosen at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it’s reliefs for me, although it killed, in another bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was considerably left wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Did a lot of work in the east end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , working with the Communists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely’s fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And she was involved in the much glorified battle of <span class="DLF">Cable Street</span> , which is an incident where when Mosely was going to march down one particular area of the east end, the people of the east end brought out all their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , their -- their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> , their -- their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , their kitchen equipment, and they blocked the <span class="DLF">roads</span> of the <span class="REGION">east end</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And for me, with a father who was growing into despair as to what was happening in Europe, this simple act meant a great deal to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn’t succeed ultimately in making a stand, in making a statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So my aunt was another very strong influence in my life because she represented anything but despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">She was vigorous, she was sexy. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She had the strangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She was a fascinating, vigorous, lovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also doing these fantastic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my life, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fiancé, someone I think she might have married, were killed when the <span class="BUILDING">Café de Paris</span> had a direct hit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  <span class="BUILDING">Café de Paris</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  The café de p -- ki -- the Café de P-Paris was a very famous café for dancing, many soldiers and people would -- would go there on leave, and it was rather posh, and I think not inexpensive, but -- and it was supposed to be absolutely safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I don’t know why people talk about something being absolutely safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It had a direct hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Her body was never found, and I remember going with my mother to try and identify various objects that were lined up somewhere in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where people queued and looked at these objects. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  You were brought up with this kind of terrible fear of what might happen to the Jews of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">When did you actually begin to discover, and to understand what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  I think I always understood, because my father had understood what was going on in the -- in- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish people and the Gypsies, and the mentally defective. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He had read men ka -- “Mein Kampf,” he had read other documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The information actually was there for anyone who wanted to know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Members of parliament denied all knowledge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and people -- I think including my father, but I’m not sure about this -- did lobby, and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on , but I don’t think that - that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And maybe for other reasons as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So I always knew, I always knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It was no secret in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that people were being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We weren’t -- I -- I don’t always know -- now when I look back, it’s difficult to be accurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Whether the details were known, I’m not su -- to me, I’m not sure, but certainly the word <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So it wasn’t a stranger to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  What years are we talking about here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  I’m talking about the -- the years -- the -- the -- the -- all during the war really, th-the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The forties. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The 1941, ’42, ’43, were years in which whilst the war was going on, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was being bombed, my father was talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  I believe there was an exhibition of photographs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">An exhibition of photographs from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which had a very profound impact on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Can you recall how old you were when you went to see that exhibition and what -- what stayed in your mind from that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of photographs came -- yes, that’s right, there was an exhibition of photographs that was shown in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It wasn’t the photographs that shocked me so much as the attitude of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I think that if I’m not mistaken, that the photographs were discontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people’s reactions. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Now, I’m not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want to believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn’t really -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and rationing, and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that -- to that extent, I think either didn’t move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it didn’t -- I don’t think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with real under -- I-let’s say how difficult 1t was for anyone to understand what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It wasn’t the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I think that I’d started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I’m -- and in -- it’s very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the more you think about it, you begin to understand your motives. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">People often ask me why did I want to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me want to go and to work for the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I think it really, now talking today, I think it wasn’t only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas everybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the -- the catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war, I think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He also had his own personal reasons for -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But I think it was also my aunt, because my aunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And her belief was you must do something, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And so I suppose it was my father’s knowledge, and my aunt’s kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do something, make a statement, however -- even if you’re waving your arms and nobody’s watching, do it, was what she was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I think that’s really what influenced me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Do you remember actually taking this decision? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And how old were you at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  I found an organization called the Jewish Relief Unit, that was in formation before the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I think I was then about 18, and I made some enquiries and I went to see them, and they announced that I was very young, but they -- they said yes, they’d consider me. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I joined the relief unit in the hope that I would be able to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Let me ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Could you tell me what the unit consisted of, who organized it, how it was run, how big it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  The Jewish Relief Unit when I first came upon it was a small <span class="BUILDING">office</span> near <span class="BUILDING">Woburn House</span> in that square, <span class="DLF">Woburn Square</span> , or <span class="DLF">Ensley Place</span> I think was it’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on a corner, and it consisted of an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with about six or seven people in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It was financed, I think, by the -- now I’m not sure about that, it might have been the Central British Fund, I cannot remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">This -- this could easily be established how the organization was funded. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I do have a book about it, but I don’t read the book, and I’m not sure why. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But anyway, there is a lot of information about the funding of this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And there were people being trained to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And these were people who were volunteers, it was a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to go, as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I started to -- to -- to train with them, telling my parents -- I was then living with my mother; my father was separated, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And this was going to be quite a difficult issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I remember sitting in Saint James’s Park, and watching the ducks where I’d met my father, and I said to him, “I -- I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he didn’t really say very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He said, “Well, you must be sure you want to go, and you’l|l have to be safe and careful.” </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Which hadn’t actually occurred to me at the time, about being safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Being careful, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But he -- he didn’t express great enthusiasm or dismay or surprise or -- my mother, of course, was aghast. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And her dreams of what she had expected of me for the future began to disappear to some extent, for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">She saw me taking a <span class="DLF">path</span> that she really didn’t like, and I suppose as a mother now it was, looking back, it must have been hard for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But I was very determined to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And so I continued to -- to train, to -- to be exposed to a psychologist who in pri -- in small intimate sessions would -- individual sessions would ask you questions, but also in group sessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I suppose there were about 20 of us volunteers at the time, who -- not all Jewish by the way, and I think that’s important to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">There were several Quakers, people who felt very strongly about what had happened, who wanted to -- who offered their -- their services. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so that’s what I did, and we went on various training courses, to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiltshire</span> , I believe, where we undertook various training in map reading and first aid, and -- but I do remember -- I do remember one session where we sat in a group and I think it was the psychologist asked everyone what they felt they expected to find, and how they would deal with the very impossible situations, and how they would deal with people who they cou -- who felt -- who didn’t want to be helped, or were past helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I remember searching my -- my th- thoughts at the time, and trying to think what -- what is the answer to that, faced with a lot of people who you can’t help. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I remember saying that maybe one has to accept that there will be people you can’t save. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And maybe if there are children and younger people there, we have to put our energies into trying to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And that maybe -- this now sounds all rather simplistic, but and maybe if -- if people see the energy going into the young and the children, that would be some compensation for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I don’t think it was such a bad idea now, looking back, because there were many people that couldn’t be helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Anyway, that was -- that was what I said at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Tell me a little bit more about the actual training process, and the extent to which you were really prepared mentally and physically for what you were about to find.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well, I-looking at how people are prepared today, say in aid agencies, which still leaves a lot to be desired, I’m not sure that we really were prepared so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It was a disparate group of -- o- of volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There were nurses, there were people with a variety of skills at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And -- but I can’t remember sitting down and really -- th-th-there was just that one discussion we had in which we were asked to face the possibility of not being able to help everyone, not being able to save everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It is important because it stayed in my mind and it -- it’s the situation that I’m faced with every day of my life now. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And it’s always hard, it’s always hard and it should always be hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But it has to be there, that acceptance that you can’t save everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But it’s so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We went to various -- as I said, we went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and I remember I drove with somebody in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> , and the idea was that we had to follow the map and find our own way there. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And map reading and finding our way around with a lot of emphasis, I think on practical help, on the provisions to be given. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">On the -- on the question of driving, and map reading, and knowing how to distribute the wherewithal, food, or provisions and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I don’t really remember, even with the help of the psychologist, a great deal of help about how we would feel, faced with what we were going to face, which wasn’t only about a d -- a -- a d-devastated people, devastated in every sense of the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Suffering from malnutrition, suffering from loss, some behaving as if they were quite mad, all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But it was also that we were going to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was in rubble, and starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I certainly wasn’t prepared for the fact -- I’d hardened all these years my heart against the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I’d grown up with a dislike and fear of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And when I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going out, on my own, with all my luggage and baggage and God knows what -- I mean, what a performance that was, I remember seeing starving German children standing along the <span class="DLF">railway line</span> , holding out their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I was traveling with soldiers, British soldiers, and everybody threw out their bread and whatever they had with them to the starving children. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Now that I wasn’t prepared for, and that was hard too, because these were children, these were innocent children. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And that brought a conflict that I hadn’t -- or an understanding that I hadn’t expected to find in myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I learned that the very first moment I traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So there were many things one wasn’t prepared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">One wasn’t prepared for the devastated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">No, we weren’t prepared, but maybe there was no way to prepare us, because nobody really knew, I think, how catastrophic was the scene that we were t-to find eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Let me take you back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Can you tell me how you were kitted out? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">What you looked like and actually the journey? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">How does an 18 year old go make her way across half of Europe and end up where? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I don’t know what your <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was, what had you been told?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  My journey remains really a bit of a mystery to me myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I was then just 20 by the way, when I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I think I was -- have to be very careful about this, but I think I just -- I was just 20 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I had uniforms, we all had. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We had officer’s uniform, we had officer’s rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And an ordinary khaki kind of ordinary wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I don’t know what you call it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It’s awful that I don’t, but anyway, I traveled in my khaki ordinary, and I traveled with the yellow star on my shoulder, my left shoulder, which is what we had elected to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And that in itself was an undertaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So not only was I kitted out beyond belief with a -- a kind of a canvas thing that was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">mobile bath</span> , or whatever, and a kit bag that really I could barely lift. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And a bedroll and all kinds of -- the bedroll was very important later on, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">mobile bath</span> , I never knew it’s -- what it was intended to do, but it -- I used to sort of keep all my dirty underwear in it because I could sort of snap it together when anybody came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You know, it was one of those things, it sort of opened out with two kind of sticks, and it wa -- oh, I don’t know, it was a kind of ghastly thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But it was very good for underwear and you could smack the two pieces together when anybody came in, and nobody could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So that’s what I did with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And there was all kinds of equipment that one didn’t actually need. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I think the bedroll was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So I was in uniform, with a cap, you know, a beret, and m-my khaki, my ghastly shoes and navy blue underwear and -- and the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And why I traveled on my own I do not know, but I think there was a very difficult procedure before anybody was allowed to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There was a very careful vetting of every individual, not necessarily verbally, I mean I didn’t meet anybody, but I know that there was one woman who belonged to the Communist party, who was not allowed to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Which was a very great disappointment to all of us who knew and loved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So, there was a very careful vetting of each individual, and I think there was a fear by the officials involved, that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> were somehow either a provocation or a difficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to control. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Whatever it was, it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And so everybody was vetted very carefully, and although we came under the auspices directly of UNRRA, we were also responsible directly also, to the British military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">At least we were in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , that means to say those of us who went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I had to go -- I mean, my final destination was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , which I -- I kept spelling in my head all the time, E-i-l-s. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I’d spoke some German by the way, because I’d learned from my father enough German to get by. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And the worst of all was that I went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Victoria</span> -- and I remember people were very helpful to me because I’m not very tall, and with all this heavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But of course they were also very -- they would also look quite quizzically at -- at the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So I was constantly in conversation, having to explain oneself. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Why one was going, what one was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And it was the beginning 1n a way of a kind of role in society, in the public, that was always slightly uncomfortable for me, and it exists to this day, where I have to explain what I’m doing for asylum seekers and refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And so I -- I'd already begun then to explain what I was doing with the yellow star on my shoulder. [</span><span class="sentence" id="172">tape break] Where am I?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  With the yellow star on your shoulder --
ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  -- you had to explain --
ANSWER:  I had to explain myself to people as to why I was wearing the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And people were tolerant, the soldiers were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> , there was a hold up. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> th -- were held up. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I can’t remember why, whether is was overcrowding. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It was quite a precarious journey eventually when I did get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because of the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , and the <span class="DLF">crossings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180"><span class="DLF">Bridges</span> was dangerous and we all had to stand on one side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in order to give balance, which was a bit nerve-wracking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  How do you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Can you explain?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Well, yes, but I haven’t quite got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> yet, because I was stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Let me go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I was stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> for a week, and we lived -- I never took my clothes off 1-in that week, and we stayed in -- oh, what are those <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Nissen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Nissen huts</span> , yes, in kind of <span class="BUILDING">dormitories</span> on paliasis and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And it was -- it was very primitive, and I remember wandering round <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> all on my own and feeling so alone, as I’ve never felt in my life before. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I hadn’t been out of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> before, which is strange in this day and age, but I had never been out of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And so this was the first time I’d been out. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I was very alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Eventually we took our turn and we were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I remember something quite awful about this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because it would always stop at various <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were not a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I mean, in other words I couldn’t -- you couldn’t -- you had no <span class="DLF">platform</span> , you had to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so to speak, without a <span class="DLF">platform</span> , in order to go to wherever you were going to be fed on the way, which again was a kind of <span class="BUILDING">Nissen hut</span> , specially prepared for the soldiers en route. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And you would sit at a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and -- and be fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I had the utmost difficulty with my height, in being able to mount this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And this was one of the -- the extraordinary things that preoccupied me on the journey, all k-kind of, sort of incidental ridiculous things, not about the seriousness of my task, but how in heaven’s name I was going to get up and down this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> without making a complete idiot of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And usually I had to be hauled up and pushed from behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ricketed along, and there was one <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that we crossed when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , when the German guard, or person on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came through carrying a lantern. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Achtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> so that we actually balanced it properly, because there was a danger that the -- you know, that -- I don’t know, that maybe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would topple over. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Whatever it was, that’s what we all did. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And then there were the children on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightmare because I was so terrified that I would not find myself at this tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- no, it wasn’t <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , do forgive me, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> was my final destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The <span class="BUILDING">station</span> I had to get out at was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badounhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badenhausen</span> , which was a base for British soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I had to find my way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badenhausen</span> , which was quite a long way, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , which was the headquarters of our unit, where Henry Lunzer, the capt -- a former captain in the British army, and who was then the director of the Jewish reli-lief unit, had set up our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And because of the fact that I had taken a secretarial course at some stage, and was quite proficient in shorthand and typing, I was for the moment, to be his assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And so that was my route, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badenhausen</span> and then on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I had no idea how I was going to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Well eventually I managed to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and I’Il never forget it, it was an extraordinary sensation. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I was on a <span class="BUILDING">German station</span> all on my own, with all my stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I remember walking down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and walking into the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And I remember hearing German, seeing German lettering, an-and this somehow <span class="BUILDING">German shops</span> and the names of things in German, and German voices, and as -- a terrible sense of panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And it was the -- didn’t -- doesn’t -- didn’t happen to me very often, but I really for the moment was frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I remember standing there and thinking, “My God,” you know, “what have I done?” </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I’m in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- it isn’t the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but you know -- I’m in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I’m with all this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And I actually had to get the things down in -- in dribs and drabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I think somebody helped me because I couldn’t carry all the stuff down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> in one go. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I think somebody did help me, and I was standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">A British officer came up in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And of course, this is what happens, and you learn this in post-war situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">There is a kind of help that doesn’t normally exist that you -- you suddenly get used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He drove up and he said, “Where are you going?” </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And I said, “I -- I have to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="225">He said, “Where the devil is that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I said, “I haven’t a clue.” </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And he said, “Well get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I’Il take you to my head -- my <span class="BUILDING">HQ</span> , and -- and we’|l try and find out where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> 1s.” </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So I went with him to his <span class="BUILDING">HQ</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And you know, I can’t remember whether I ate -- I can remember cleaning up, I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I remember there was some sort of provision there, and I -- I cleaned myself up a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I must have been filthy because the week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> , it was not the most hygienic. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And I felt an awful wreck, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And eventually -- but I don’t remember eating anything at all, except on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And then he came down, and he was very efficient, rather like something you see in British war films now, on a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You know, very elegant, very beautiful, very well spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And he said, “Look, I -- I’ve -- I’ve found a -- I’ve found somebody who -- we found <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , it’s a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , Pll get you there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I’m still conscious of the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I was very grateful that somehow -- you know, this -- this curious thing of sh -- of pride and shame, you know, what was the yellow star going to do for us out there? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Was it going to open <span class="DLF">doors</span> , was it going to bring hostility? </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But I’d explained to him what we were about, and he took it perfectly in his stride. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And they found a driver for me, and finding a driver and finding a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in those days was hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So I had to wait quite a long time, and then I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And I remember when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , which is a tiny, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and I met with Henry Lunzer, and I think he -- he and I at that time, at that moment, were the only people there, although some British officers were coming over that evening for whatever, I don’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And he was in -- we were in a commandeered <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the local Nazi, and that was the kind of way things were done there, that people were billeted in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of the former Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And the former Nazi would have been Nazi leader, I don’t know whether he was imprisoned or whatever the situation was for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But certainly some of his staff was still around, and I was very conscious of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Did you have any encounters with them, or --
ANSWER:  Oh, I always had encounters with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I always had encounters with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I -- I -- my work developed whilst I was in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , between two camps and the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">One camp was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The other camp was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> , where I did a great deal of work, probably more than I did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , the vil -- the -- the center itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And it -- it was there, in the main, that I had encounters with the local Germans, although I did have a very angry encounter with somebody once later on, much later on, when I was taking somebody from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ORT</span> , the American organization, well known, of course, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Shall I just tell that story now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  We -- one of the things -- and you see, the context is always so difficult, why with me I don’t know, but I had to -- I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , C-e-double |-e, which is a very beautiful, medieval town -- I think it’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">medieval town</span> , not so far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And it was my job to remain there, and to escort this Am-American woman who had come -- I think it was ORT, and I was to take her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And as we were eating in the -- the mess, the officer’s mess with other soldiers, and I was talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , and this German waitress sort of said very arrogantly in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- and I don’t know why there’s all this discussion about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , we didn’t know anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We nev -- we didn’t know that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> we don’t know what all this talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But she was extremely arrogant, and for the first and only time in my life, I stood up and I was going to hit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I was going to hit her very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And it was only when the -- the p -- the person from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ORT</span> could see what I was d -- about to do, that she restrained me, but I -- I have never since felt such violent rage as I felt for that woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I do -- I can, amongst all the other things I understand, and I preach about tolerance, about this, about that, I can understand violent rage in such situations, because I was out of control, totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But these servants that we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , were German. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There was Frau Shermburg and her daughter, who’d come from eastern German -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who declared frequently that they’d been raped. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Frau Shermburg was the wife of a doctor who’d been killed, and her son had been killed in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Her daughter was a nurse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  And what was there role exactly, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Their role was to provi -- was to cook and help us manage the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We were very, very -- what’s the word I want? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Very correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We -- Henry Lunzer had been an officer in the British army. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He maintained good standards of behavior within the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Nothing should be broken, nothing should be taken that was not ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">If it was broken it had to be recorded as having been broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We were to be mindful and careful of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And Frau Shermburg and her daughter cooked and managed the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">There was people that came in and dealt with the laundry, because by the time other people joined us -- I suppose I must have been one of the first, really, to go out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> because other people joined us later. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Harry git -- Grojinsky from the Grojinsky bakers came, and he was the officer for provisions and storekee -- <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And so, as people came, laundry and other things needed to be in place, and a -- and as -- and a group of about I think at least seven or eight drivers, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> -- because that was the only way we could manage to move around <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> obviously, there was no transport provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  So you were all billeted in this Nazi’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  And you were looked after by this --
ANSWER:  Well, I wouldn’t say looked after, she -- Frau Shermburg was there to -- to cook, and -- but she was treated well, and I -- and she was billeted -- she wasn’t living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But I remember there was one scene, a very ugly scene, where she told me that they were being attacked on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , for being -- for working with us at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish relief unit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And she said would somebody escort her. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And one of the men in the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> escorted her, one of the tall men escorted her -- them, back to their <span class="BUILDING">billet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But there was one scene where a group of very angry people --
QUESTION:  From the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  From the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They were angry, I think they were drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They were very noisy, and they were carrying sticks, and they came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> outside, and they made a terrible din. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And Frau Shermburg was -- she said these are the peop -- these are people who di -- are going to hurt us if we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I, at that time, had been befriended by -- this was much later in my experience there, I'd been befriended by somebody from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> , and I did quite a lot of work with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And he had said to me on one occasion -- he taught me many things, he taught me for example, how to wake up at a certain time, which was my difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I was very young, and I had difficulty waking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he told me that you can wake up any time you say you want to wake up, you can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So he taught me that, so that I wasn’t late for things. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And -- but he also said to me amongst many other lessons, if you meet th -- a kind of -- in a -- a situation in which you’re isolated, and a lot of people are at the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , or wha -- a-angry, don’t come out in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">posse</span> -- he didn’t use that word, but don’t come out in a group, one of you goes out, only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And on this occasion, I think because -- I don’t know whether we were short of people, or whether because I am so short and small, and was quite small -- slender at the time -- not now, but then, I -- I went out, and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I stood by this -- in front of them, without saying anything, with nothing in my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And we just looked at each other, and then they slunk away. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But it was a very important lesson to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It may not have worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It could -- it need not have worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They could have done anything, but they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And it -- on this occasion it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">To take you back again a little step, what kind of an <span class="REGION">area</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> in, and what did it look like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westphalia</span> , some distance from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , I should think about 20 kilometers, maybe less. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It is -- 1t was a very beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Not so much the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> itself, because some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were modern, you know, spacious, fantastic <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in their own <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , with a <span class="INT_SPACE">laundry room</span> and you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But the walks were brilliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> were lovely and we would often walk in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And there was a woman called Frau Mometchka who was German, who had married a Jew, and who died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , her husband did. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And she really belonged nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Because of her background she could not live within the German community. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And oh -- because of -- she didn’t quite belong in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">She was a very educated, elegant -- it’s very difficult to be elegant in those circumstances, but very dignified woman in her 60’s, I would think. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Tall, upright, spoke a beautiful German, played the piano beautifully, used to play for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">How she came to us I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">She was there one day when I came back from a mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I don’t know where I’d been. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I got to know her very well, she was very fond of me, we used to walk in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was beautiful, absolutely -- absolutely lovely, with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">streams</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Lovely <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And she would talk to me about her husband, she would talk to me about music, she would try to correct my terrible German. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">She was very much a teacher, a scholar. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I had a great admiration for her, and affection for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It wasn’t unusual for people to end up in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with very few questions asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I mean, it’s very strange, but in those circumstances you don’t ask very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I don’t ever remember saying how did Frau Mometchka come? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I didn’t know how she went, because when I came back from one mission, she wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I said, ““Where’s Frau Mometchka?” </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And they said, “Oh no, she’s not here any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And I never knew where she went, but because of the speed, and the ferocity of everything that was going on, and the anxiety of pri -- everyday life, I didn’t ask, and I never knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  Now you’ve told us that you lived in this -- th-the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had formerly been occupied by one of the local Nazis, but your <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I believe, was elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Could you tell us about the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and w -- and the job that you went there to do, and that you ended up doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was a short distance from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It was just a v -- a few minutes walk from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> up a <span class="DLF">country lane</span> , and was simply a low, brick building. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I don’t know what it had been before. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">It looked a bit like a -- a <span class="BUILDING">keeper’s house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It -- but we used it as an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It had obviously been a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And I set up there with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and looked out over onto the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And -- and that’s really where the work of the unit was fashioned in that -- in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">There was a German man, who’d obviously been close to his master, the Nazi, I think, leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I took an instant dislike to him, and I would often work in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I -- I -- ?</span><span class="sentence" id="348">ma slow worker, and I often -- and I still do it, I work late and long, and I would often be in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on my own and he’d be stoking the -- there was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> , an old-fashioned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> where you burned wood to heat the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boiler</span> for hot water and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boiler</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And he would fidget about the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was terribly uneasy with him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And I found some leaflets in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , Nazi leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I asked him to throw them in the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There was a whip -- I always remember that, there was a whip hanging up on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Now, that could have been for anything, I mean it need not have had an ominous -- a particularly ominous meaning, maybe they had animals, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But it -- 1t made me very uneasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I said to him one day, “What is that doing there? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Why is it here in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It’s not something I want to see.” </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And he said, “Hm, it was always in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And I -- I said, “Please take it away, get rid of it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But he didn’t like me, and I didn’t like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And Frau Shermburg -- Frau Shermburg looked to me for arbitration and negotiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">She recognized very quickly that I could negotiate for her and her daughter with Henry the director, and f-for any facilities that she needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And that became my role. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">She would show me photographs of her husband, the doctor who was killed, and her son, standing near the Arc de Triomphe. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And --
QUESTION:  In uniform, presumably?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  In uniform, looking very much the Nazi -- well, the -- the German officer that he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And it was very difficult, it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It was a mother showing a picture of -- of her husband, her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">She maintained, as did her daughter, and I believe it to be so, that when the Russians came in to where they were living in <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> , they were both raped many times and in front of each other and that -- that was not surprising, the story of rape was very common, both in -- particularly within the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And you know, these kind of situations, to do with who you are and where you’re born, become very relevant -- and the choices that you make. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And you have to ask yourself what choices did she have? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">On the other hand she didn’t see the significance of showing me the picture of her son standing near the Arc de Triomphe. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I did have to point that out to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It was a -- it was difficult, this relationship with local Germans, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I remember looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> one day when a colleague of mine, Edith Blau, who’d been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and who’d been liberated with her mother by the Russians, and both of them were living in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- as I say, people came and went, and people stayed, and she stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And she’s now in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And she was passing a group of Germans in -- she was in uniform with a yellow star, she became a member of our team. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I s -- I was looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw her strike, very hard, one of the German women who’d obviously made a remark about the Jews, having seen the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So tensions were high. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Strange things did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">There were stories about Germans putting wire across the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in order that British soldiers on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> could be decapitated, and that did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And it was an uneasy time. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">You did not sleep easily, let me put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">You -- you were aware, all the time, of tensions, of hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Your own and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And that was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">That was hard, that bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  Tell me about the first few days, first few weeks in your job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  Well, for the first few weeks of my job, I think, was trying to help Henry to get some sort of order into what was a fairly chaotic situation, and to try to formulate some kind of strategy for the administration of a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I’d never had any experience of that before, but he, being an army officer, a captain in the British army, had experienced -- and so I learned from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And we did quite well, I think; he was efficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But after just a couple of days we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We drove. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And a ye -- part of Mrs. Henriekie’s team, she led the first team into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , the first team of the Jewish Relief Unit into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And her team was there, and I must say I was incredibly nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It was reassuring being with Henry, but nevertheless, I was very nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Now, I can’t remember that first day very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We went to the -- to the concrete blocks which had belonged to the -- oh, to the ger -- German army -- to the -- forgive me, I’Il come back to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">But you know that the people who’d been in -- liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp one</span> , when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp one</span> was burned down, they were taken to the concrete blocks, where the German army had -- had been billeted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  We just paused there, and -- to allow Mrs. Bamber to reflect on whose <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> we were talking about exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  It was the former <span class="BUILDING">German barracks</span> , but I -- I -- I do not -- th-the name, it has escaped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Some people refer to is as the former <span class="BUILDING">SS bar</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But whatever, the people were incarcerated there in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were bleak, they were kind of solid blocks of concrete. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I can’t remember the lighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I always remember it as very dim. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I remember candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I remember staying all night one -- on one occasion with s-somebody who died in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And it was over time talking to people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that bu -- was my first encounter with the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Now, it wasn’t on that first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">That first day was a kind of initiation into the whole atmosphere of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I met the unit -- the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> one, which had been burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I saw the mounds, these huge mounds where had -- which had formed the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was very -- there was always about that <span class="NPIP">place</span> particularly, that camp one, there was this strange, sweet smell which I -- I know to be the smell of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I believe it to be, but I always refer to it as the smell of geraniums, because that’s what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It was like taking the leaves of the geraniums and crushing them in your hand and then smelling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And it’s -- it’s a sweet, dank smell, and that was the smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I’ve never forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And sometimes I’m reminded of it when the smell returns, that kind of dank smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And this sense of awfulness, the sense of death was there in that <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> that was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">There were no bodies, there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was by the side of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">You felt very uneasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I -- I know that I went there the first day, and I went there many times with other people who were involved in some kind of mourning. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They may be people who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much later, this was much later -- or they were the inmates, although very few of them went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But I went there sometimes, and I attended the ceremony there, where the monument was erected, the first monument, in memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I believe there’s a picture somewhere of my unit marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It’s somewhere in the <span class="BUILDING">Vina library</span> , and I’ve never been to see it, but I believe it exists, because people have told me that it does, and they recognize me, mainly I think because I was very small, and I was in front for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But I returned many times, and I spent many days there, and I spent a long period in the winter, because I remember sleeping in a sleeping bag with all my clothes on in the very cold winters that followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And what was I doing there? </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And that’s the difficulty, I can’t really remember that I had a particular role as I had in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I went and I talked, and I can’t remember anybody asking me to do that, or seeing any value in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So maybe I elected to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">When I knew that a driver or somebody was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , which was very frequent, people frequently went there with provisions or with papers, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">There was no other way of communicating than by going somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">The telephone systems were down, and it was very difficult to make telephone calls. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And so it was -- the easiest thing was to always go to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So it is not surprising that I elected to go, and I elected to go I think because over time I found that by talking to people -- that by receiving the information that they gave me, was in itself a v -- a v -- a value. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">That doesn’t sound very profound, but people who give the most terrible information, of death, destruction, loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Who rock with misery and despair, who are desperately fearful, who want to die, many of them, but can’t, it’s very important to receive that information in a way that says to people, I am your witness, I am here to tell your story. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">If you can’t tell it, I will be able to tell it for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But all I can be is your witness, I can’t take away the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Now I didn’t learn that quickly, I learned it painfully because I always felt I couldn’t do anything, what am I doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I can’t take away the past, I can’t change anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So what is the value of my presence, and why do I keep coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And I think it was because I began to learn that being a witness, simple and ordinary and limited as that may be, does have a value to the person who may not live very long, and who knows it. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And so, I think in a way that was one of my tasks, but why I spent so many weeks there, sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and what work I did with Henry there, or with anybody else, I honestly can’t tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I later went back there many times, when I was responsible much later for what was referred to as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TB train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I was sent to nic -- by Henry, to negotiate in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with a Jewish organization, humanitarian organization for the transfer of young people suffering from tuberculosis, who -- whose chance of recovery would be very much greater if they were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to recover, which was one of the ways people treated tuberculosis in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and I met this extraordinary woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I remember saying to her -- I wasn’t in uniform, and I don’t know why, maybe it was politic -- no, to be -- I just can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I remember saying to her, “Why -- why -- how did you recognize me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And she said, “It really wasn’t difficult to recognize you, I would have recognized you anywhere, as one Jew to another.” </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Anyway, I went with the x-rays, and when I say I went with the x-rays, believe me, I’m saying something extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Because to persuade people, young people, who were desperate to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , desperate to get out, to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , desperate to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">To persuade them to have an x-ray to identify that they were suffering tuberculosis was the last thing that they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  Because it excluded them from --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  -- going to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Yes, they would not be acceptable, and they knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And there was all kinds of maneuvering and manipulation of x-rays, and t -- name changing, and I mean it was a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And it -- it was a killer, I mean I -- I worked incredibly hard, and I remember losing my voice with the sheer -- you know, the -- the energy needed to persuade people that they wouldn’t be able to go anyway, that they would be identified anyway at some point as having the illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And I'd hoped I was right to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I wasn’t working alone, I had a -- good advisors, but I had to persuade people. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And then I had to persuade this -- to go with this delightful woman and persuade the Swiss authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And I remember a very suave, very beautiful, tall Swiss gentleman, who made clear to me, reluctantly, that yes, a certain number of young people would be acceptable to the Swiss, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davose</span> to be treated for their tuberculosis, on the understanding only that they were -- could recover, and that they could return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the end of their treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And that was th -- one of the first political lessons of my lifetime, because I learned about the la -- lo -- lack of compassion, I lat -- learned about politics, and in that one meeting, I learned it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I learned about officialdom, bureaucracy that -- that -- that -- tha-tha -- that -- that protects people from the truth, 1t protects people from looking at that sick, young person. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I was very sick at heart myself, I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But I'd actually got the agreement, so I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then there was an enormous activity on my part, and others helping me, to try to arrange for the evacuation of the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And I have pictures of this that can be supplied, to go on what was referred to as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TB train</span> from <span class="BUILDING">Hanover station</span> , which was bombed and derelict, catastrophically so, to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And eventually -- I mean it was, I suppose, a triumph, but nothing -- it didn’t feel like a triumph, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Nothing -- it just felt right, I suppose, that young people should be treated eventually after many months, having fought with many officials, British army officials in -- particularly on one occasion, when I needed a document that hadn’t come. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They needed about five or six different permissions in order to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , from the British military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And if they hadn’t got all five or six, they couldn’t travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And in one case I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , I think 1t was, and persuade them to allow a young person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And I think we were all day trying to persuade them. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Finally I think it was only because we offered a lift. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to catch the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to put the document on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I mean, it’s all very primitive stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And -- and I got per -- I think that he was persuaded because we gave a lift to somebody to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And finally I got the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Eventually the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went, but it was made clear to me by <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> and the Red Cross, that if -- that I was short of one particular document necessary for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TB train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And that, you know, I would be held responsible for that, that everything was on course, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TB train</span> would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It was all arranged by the Red Cross, but that at the last minute, there could be a hitch, and that that was my responsibility because I hadn’t got this document. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So I remember standing on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , waiting for it to go, and the sense of fear and trepidation, everybody was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">The children, the young people were laughing and singing and looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I was terrified that at the end of the day there would be a hitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Some official, some army official would come along and say I’m so sorry, but this is not correct, there’s -- something here is missing. </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Let me take you back -- whoops -- let me take you back to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , and your early days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">How many survivors were there, and where were they from, what kind of state were they in? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Can you tell me about them? </span><span class="sentence" id="499">You’ve taken us as far as describing the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they were housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">What do you see in terms of -- of -- of the people within those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  The people were mainly Polish, Romanian, from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There was one remote German woman who remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And the reason, of course, was that most had been killed much earlier on. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And she would always talk to me about the if factor. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">If my husband had only done this, he would not have been taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">If he hadn’t looked in my direction, or if he had kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Or if -- if -- if -- and this was always the word that people used all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">If - if only. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And this preoccupied people so much, if only. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And so you constantly had to ge -- take people back to the fact that it was -- it was totally out of their hands, that there was an inevitability about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And -- but it was such a painful journey to take with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">She spoke English I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Mostly Polish, some were ruma -- well, <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And of course, the two famous people who emerged as leaders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp eventually,</span> and who I got to know very well, was Yosul Rosenzoft, a former lawyer, Polish, and Dr. Bimko, who became his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Right, so you were telling me you take Mrs. Forest, to -- to give us the names of the two leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">But before that, if you can give me a sense of the kind of condition these people were in, how they were dressed, how they lived, how they slept, and the kind of experiences with which they were then trying to come to terms already, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  I remember people sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and dressed in old jackets, trousers. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Things were handed out, and when we ourselves had supplies of clothes, but they were ill-fitting, and people wore anything, so people continued to look somehow ill-kempt, and ill -- ill-fitting, ill-dressed, ill-cared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They were emaciated, so very few things really fitted them well. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They looked ill, they had a terrible pallor, terrible color. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But what you have to, I think, remember, is that people survive because they are survivors very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">You know, there’s a s -- there’s a reason, there’s a certain something, X factor, that putting chance to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , where you stand or where you don’t, people do survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Once they’ve -- they’re into the role of survivor, they do begin to get a resilience, and a kind of strength, and so people were fiercely active, fiercely wanting to get out, fiercely wanting to organize in some way, and fiercely angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But people, how did they look when I first saw them? </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Ill, emaciated, thin hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Very thin hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">They had the hands of old people like you -- you see sometimes in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> where th-the whole hand di -- hardly resembles a hand, where the bones stick out, and they used to press their fingers into you very often, in a kind of se -- with a sense of urgency they would hold you. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And you would hold them, if you were sensible, and -- and you would rock, because rocking was very much part of the way they would present. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">You would sit on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> sometimes with people and hold and rock. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And people would hold you, and dig their fingers in while they told you their story. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And I always -- and I’ve said in my writings that they spat out their story like a kind of vomit, 1t came out in a hissing sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It’s just barely audible, you -- you often couldn’t understand what they were saying, but you knew, without understanding just by the -- some words, some snatches of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">You were never alone with anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">There were always people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">There was always people around, so people would often ch-chime in, and -- and come up with something. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But I -- I was alone with the German woman, and I can’t remember the circumstances, and I’m just hoping -- I don’t think it was at ca -- you see, I spent a lot of time in the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> , but I’m sure it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> because in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> they were mainly Hungarian, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> I think, for some reason, I was more alone with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And she told me about her husband, and it was very pitiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But people soon -- soon began to resemble some form of normal kind of appearance. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Their faces would fill out, their stomachs would protrude because I think it’s part of malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">You don’t suddenly become -- you don’t fill out properly, you fill out chaotically. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And particularly with the younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But I remember some young adolescent boys, and they looked like any young kids from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , with caps and ill-fitting clothes, and they didn’t look so unusual after some months. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">People recovered, and they recovered slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Those that were going to die, died very quickly, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  On that subject -- on that subject, the day you arrive, I believe -- you know, th-there was -- there was such a sense of desperation still, that a woman took her own life, and her child’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Do you recall that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The day I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , we were told that a woman who’d had a -- a child by, I think a Ukrainian guard, had drunk Lysol, and her -- poured the Lysol down the throat of her child, and they both died. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And it -- it was horrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And it was -- yes, it’s strange I didn’t remember that at first, that that was so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But we all block. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And there was a sense of real horror and upset amongst the workers about this woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  How did it affect the other survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  That I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I only know how it affected the workers, and it was -- it felt like a sense of failure, like it does with all carers, who care for people who take their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">You feel you have failed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So, there’s a kind of so-called reasonably normal response in a totally, totally abnormal situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  In terms of food and medicine and equipment and so on, how well were you equipped to help these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  I think we often lacked supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I remember on one occasion we were waiting for some supplies to come, and eventually a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> arrived at the -- our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And it turned out to be a <span class="BUILDING">traveling synagogue</span> and didn’t have the supplies that we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And those of us who were less religiously inclined had quite a lot to say at the time, including myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We were furious, and very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Oh, so much for what people feel you need. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It was -- I mean, a lot of supplies were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">ORT was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">There were other American organizations bringing in supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And we ourselves did have supplies and we did man the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , which was run, I think, by one of the nun’s sisters, who was a m -- a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Henry Lunzer --
QUESTION:  So this is a -- this is a sister of your boss?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, and she was running the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And I remember her showing us around the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was called the <span class="BUILDING">Glen Hughes Hospital</span> after Brigadier Glen Hughes who reli -- who liberated Belsen, and who was, I believe, a remarkable man. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">What can I say about the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I think I learned -- I learned so much in those months I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">You know, I think what I -- I learned, looking at what was going on in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- you’ve got to remember that nurses of the 30’s and the 40’s were brought up to believe in everything being absolutely pristine, to be -- you know, to have sheets that are tightly drawn, to have -- you know, to have everything clean, and -- and cared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And again, it’s like all the bureaucracies -- I mean, I do understand it, it -- it is -- the idea of chaos 1s always frightening, but chaos can sometimes be quite healing. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And what I thought was very good, was when I watched people helping their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">By that I mean maybe relatives, maybe friends, maybe a child, somebody feeding their -- their relative, or their friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And it would be a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The cl -- the cl -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> would be in a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Their trembling hands would never quite reach the mouth appropriately and there would be mess all over the bedclothes, and -- but -- but there was a to -- it was noise, and there was bustle, and there was a sense of activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And I think that that is far safer for healing than the kind of -- the preparation for -- you na -- this sort of -- you being prepared for death with your white sheet tucked tightly round you, and I’m simplifying something very much, and I must be forgiven for that, because there 1s a place for order in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> scene, and many people do ask for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">But there are situations in which chaos and care can match, and can bring about solutions. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And when I started, many years later with a group of other mothers, an association for the welfare of children in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , so that mothers could go into <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with their small children under the age of five, I remembered all the time the lessons that I’d learned in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And that is that sometimes it’s better for a bit of chaos if you are looking after your child, and the sense of care and love is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And there will be people who will disagree with me about this, and people who will remember everything about Belsen differently than I do, but I was only 20 years old, impressionable, taking everything in and not all of it may be as coherent as the listener would wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Well, you say you were very young, as indeed you were, but in -- how could you, at such a very young age, absorb and make any sense of what you were seeing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  I think I was all -- you know, I don’t remember approp -- this sounds rather self indulgent, but I don’t remember a proper childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I remember being a very grown-up child. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Not willingly, but somehow forced upon me by circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I was always very serious, although I enjoyed fun, and I enjoyed fun when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with my comrades. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We had lots of fun and laughter, like one does in extreme situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">But -- I mean, you -- it -- it’s difficult now to -- to be honest, and to say did I absorb all that then, or have I somehow taken it in and absorbed it slowly over the years? </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And there may be something in the latter, because every time I look back, I realize of things I learned, and maybe I didn’t realize at the time I was learning about human relationships, about everything, and about hatred, about love, everything was encapsulated in that experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Given the kind of desperate physical and psychological state of -- of these survivors, how did you begin? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Can you recall how you began trying to reach out to them, and help them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  I can’t remember trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I remember moving into the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> and talking, and being a ve -- and sort of sitting on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I mean, don’t misunderstand, as people became stronger, they became angry, and you, being the carer, you being the provider, would often become the target for people’s anger, because you could not provide the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So I think with the creativity that existed amongst some of the survivors, and our own need to feed into that, we were able to support some of the things that were going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">For example, Yosul, and Dr. Bunko, and somebody called Norbert Fallheim, who later committed suicide, formed a committee within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They were representatives of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We were the next sort of go-between between ourselves, between them, and UNRRA, and the military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So we would naturally, whilst we were supporting what they were doing, at the same time we would become the recipients of much of their anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I can remember sitting in an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Merck car</span> that had been commandeered from somewhere by somebody, sort of closely packed in at the back with Norbert, and Yosul, and somebody else, and myself desperately trying to take notes with Henry and somebody else in the front, while they were raging and ranting and very angry indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">About- but you see, curiously enough, I think it was a relief because it was human, and it was life. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And it was such a relief from the desperate, dejected, huddled figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">You know, sometimes when I used to go -- when I first started to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , people didn’t look like human beings, they -- th-they were all kind of like a huddle of clothes sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">It was quite horrible, because it was dim, and y -- and you couldn’t always identify nu -- it -- and here were people shouting about what they wanted, and being very angry, with us, with them, with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And in a way, although I felt very vulnerable sometimes, at being shouted at, I also was a go- between in my familiar familial pattern, between them and my own hierarchy, between them and Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And so they would come to me, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span> , and they would ask me to negotiate, and they would complain about Henry, and then they would complain to Henry about UNRRA, and then all the rest of it and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Because of course, what they wanted more than anything else was freedom, and they hadn’t got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I mean, I’m making it sound as if I understood it all, and I don’t think I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I think it’s only with hindsight that I can talk about anger as being something very positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But it’s something that makes you feel alive, whereas when I used to see the people huddled, and I thought to myself, I wonder if they’re going to die, th -- I'd -- I -- I think I just felt that I could do more in that situation of vigor and anger, and -- and vision, because they had a vision of what they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Which was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Well, they wanted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They wanted out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Some people wanted -- you know, this is a difficulty now, this is a big difficulty, because people talk about the formation of an organization that was -- whose aim was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Now, my recollection is that there were many people who wanted to go, for one reason or another, either to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And obviously they couldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  When you say obviously, can you explain that for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  Well, it’s very little different than it is now, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I don’t think you could get into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> unless you were sponsored by a relative or friend, and sponsored quite energetically. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You had to be able to provide for that person completely and absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And one or two people did go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So I don’t remember anybody going from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And others wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I’m sure some did. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And some people did come to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">But there were many -- the majority didn’t and couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I think it was only with the realization that nobody really wanted them again -- yet again. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">That no -- that the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were not opening generously to -- and -- and -- and with -- what’s the word I want? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Like, with <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> joining together in order to provide a solution for this group of people, who remained there, some of them, until 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Which is a very long time from 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So it’s not surprising that people became more militant and more determined that <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was the only solution for the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  Again, let me take you back a little bit, because I think a lot of us don’t know quite as much and -- and we need filling in. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I’m very interested to know what a typical day was, or a typical week in your life out there, or in the life of the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">What you did in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , what you did with the people, you know, in a fairly basic kind of way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  I mean, I was very involved with Henry in trying to negotiate for better facilities within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And withi -- and within groups where Jewish people had -- had -- had come and were in need of provision, and -- and -- and support. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And so we would be writing and Henry would be meeting -- I might accompany him with others, to try to negotiate, either with UNRRA or with the British government for better facilities here, and better facilities there. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I would write endless letters, and I would be -- spend a huge amount of time screaming down the telephone because the telephones did exist, but it was almost impossible to hear anyone, and you would spend hours trying to get somebody, and it made such a difference because otherwise you just had to get ina <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So I would do normal secretarial work in support for Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I would accompany him, particularly where Yosul and Norbert was concerned -- were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But I spent a lot of time -- and this again is something I'd -- I can’t put -- I can’t be too correct about, because I simply can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz camp</span> -- what happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> was that -- and I can’t even tell you exactly where it 1s --
QUESTION:  This was a camp for women, was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  There were mainly women, there were some men, but there were li -- a large number of Hungarians -- Hungarian woman, but there were some young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And we got a telegram to the unit, which -- which I -- it came to me, saying that -- that they were desperate, that they had no provisions, no means of support, that -- that there was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and there was nothing and they were desperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  How many people were there, do you recollect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  A lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I don’t remember the number, and I can’t tell you the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It was quite -- it must have been about 600 - 700 people, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And I went there, but I don’t remember with whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I went there with somebody and we had a meeting in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , up some <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , <span class="DLF">wooden stairs</span> with -- there were only candles, it was very cold then, very cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  Which winter was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  The first. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I just wish one could remember more, who was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And I went back with whoever, and negotiated for provisions, for supplies, for acknowledgement that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> existed and needed, you know, the support of UNRRA and other facilities, as well as our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But then they got -- was a -- was a situation in which I would go very frequently to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and that doesn’t seem to be acknowledged by anybody now who can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Neither Henry, nor Allison Ward, with -- who was our personnel officer, and who 1s still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Both are still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Neither have a clear recollection of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Allison said yes, she remembers that I used to go off frequently with this former Hungarian Jewish Brigade leader, and that we would work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But I can’t tell you how it was, whether I elected to g -- I know I must have elected to go because I was there so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I was there for their first Pesach, which we had in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And I remember we atrived late, and they were quite fed up with us for being late, and they had to carry me across all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , and there was enormous hilarity about that, as I was carried aloft across <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And I got to know them very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But they needed a lot of support, they were young women, who were very beautiful many of them, who were very si -- very vulnerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Who the person I was working with was very anxious to protect from the sexual advances of any soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And I remember a very moving discussion in which he spoke, and said -- and I was so touched that in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the middle of all this mess, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was mud, you were up to your ankles in mud at the time -- or later, because 1t was snowing then, but he -- he spoke to the women and told them, you must preserve yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">You’ve been preserved for a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I can remember it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">You’ve been preserved for a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Don’t destroy yourselves, don’t capitulate to men who find you beautiful and who want to give you chocolate, and who want to try to help you, and maybe not help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He was really telling them, you have a sexuality which you’re only just realizing because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> your hair was cut, you didn’t have your periods, you now do -- but he didn’t say this in so many words. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">But he gave this very moving talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I was so touched by this, and thought it was so wonderful that -- that we should be talking there, preserve yourselves somehow as a woman, and as women. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And it’s important. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And then we danced, I remember we did lots of dancing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  What kind of dancing was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Oh, anything, we just danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">We danced the hora a lot, and -- hora, and then we -- there were people who knew various variations that I’d never seen before, that were fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And lots of songs and wonderful, it was wonderful the way -- it was full of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I met two of the woman later, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And they’d managed somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But 1-it’s -- I-I don’t know what we were trying to do there, we were trying and -- 1-1-it was such a unsupported group of people, and it was so primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I think 1t was a very primitive camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Somebody once described it as a very good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I thought it was very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I remember there was a sort of wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , you know, one of these open jobs, and sort of just by the side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and you know, you had to have people on guard when you went in there, because there’s no way you could fasten the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and it was -- it -- that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was cold and primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We got supplies in, we got learning material in. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We did something. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We did our best. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Helen Bamber. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Now, the survivors who you dealt with were now officially displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">What did that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  Well, first of all it meant that as far as the officials were concerned, the word survivor or victim had gone out of their vocabulary, and the word displaced persons, which 1s a sort of anonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a useful shield, just as we use the word asylum seekers today, so the word displaced persons, and then DPs, even worse, was used. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So the compassion that was there at the very beginning, and the sense of outrage when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated, had gone, in my view. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And the DPs, displaced persons were seen as a problem, number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a nuisance, a -- a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They were vocal, they’d become articulate, they had their committee, they were demanding, they wanted rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">What wa -- what rights did they want? </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They wanted rights within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They wanted rights of travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They wanted to be able to move about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And that was very difficult because as far as I remember, and this - this can be corrected by others, the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not allowed to leave or to travel without special permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Now, in the early days, many of the young displaced persons went particularly, as I remember, to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , mainly to try to find their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They went to their old, former <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to find their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">When they got there, they were set upon by the local people, who drove them out, and some killings took place, and some assaults took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And the people, bedraggled, and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet, would return back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I use barbed wire as a -- as a -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarceration. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So their options were very limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">If they wanted to find their relatives -- and this was at the beginning, for the first year or so was the most important as I remember it, was the finding of relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Now we had set up a search bureau in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And that was one of the things that one of the volunteers in our unit had trained at doing was to set up a search bureau. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">People who would come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> again presumably illegally because they would come and there was no way in which they should have been able to enter or to leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper, rolled up paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It was probably cigarette paper, with the names of relatives on it, asking has anybody seen or heard of so and so? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And the names would be on these little bits of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And they would give them to you, or they would give them to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They would just hand them out, and you would -- you would do your best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  How did the search bureau work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  I’m not well acquainted with the search bureau. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">The <span class="BUILDING">search bureau</span> presumably tried to marry people through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or through other means, relatives of the named person, so -- on the piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So, it did it’s job. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Whether it did it adequately, I can’t say. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">It was primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">But in some cases people were reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">There were other search bureaus that were established as time went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I’m not quite sure if the Red Cross was not involved also in trying to reunite people. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">That also can be confirmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I have -- you -- you know, I have a very fragmented, compartmentalized memory of this particular period of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So I can’t really speak with authority about the organization of the search bureaus. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I know that there were several, I know that we had one in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And I know that people came searching for their relatives, handing bits of paper to each other in order to see whether somebody remembered somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">It was pathetic, and very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Full of pathos, very sad to watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  You’d been -- you’d been speaking earlier about the options available to people now -- once they were DPs, if you like. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Can you tell us a little more about the options they were seeking? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">You said that some of them wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , for example, to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and what became of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">QUESTION:  But what about those who -- who had their eyes set on other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  I think my memory 1s of people wanting to come, many of them, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">There was no means by which they really could simply ask to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I’m not sure if the American quota system was operating in the way that it normally does. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">In other words, so many from -- you know, that you’re on the German quota list, or the Romanian, Hungarian, or Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But what I do know was that it wasn’t possible simply to enter the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> , or the <span class="COUNTRY">UK</span> , not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Some people did, and they’re very proud of it, and they say it as though anybody could have done it, but they must forgive me, I don’t believe it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise they would have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I-It’s -- 1t was hard for people, they couldn’t get out, and they couldn’t go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">They couldn’t go -- the Iron Curtain had already fallen, they couldn’t go to the <span class="REGION">Iron Curtain countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">They knew that they would be badly treated if they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They knew what was going on by returnees. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And so what were their options? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">To find their relatives, to -- but then, as the months passed people realized that nothing had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Perhaps they had found a relative, perhaps they’d accepted that that was it, that nobody was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Or they lived in hopes, but they still wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , of course, the Germans were beginning to mingle, to fraternize with British, American and other soldiers in the various <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And this came very hard to the inmates, the fact that they were still displaced persons while something else was going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I believe then that a hardening of attitudes took place, a realization for many that they were not wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">That was the feeling, that nobody really wanted to open their <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I mean, many people returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , some maybe to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">But on the whole, people remained, and they didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So, I think that is when -- and again I must be forgiven by tha- by those people who see it differently, but I begin that 1 -- I believe that it was then that the idea of becoming more Zionist, wanting to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> is the only solution for their problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I believe it was then that it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So people began to learn Hebrew if they didn’t already know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">They became more militant. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">There were the illegal transportations to -- to cross frontiers to try to get illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And of course, many people perished on the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  What did you know at the time about these illegal journeys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  What did I know? </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Well, everybody knew that it was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">It was no secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">An organization grew, an organization of -- I’m not giving it a name, I don’t know it -- whether there ever was a name, but you know, with all these situations of -- of despair and need, a militancy grows, an urgency grows. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">People are not going to stay in that situation forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And historically this has always happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">It’s happening now with the Kurds, and it’s happened elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">People want something for themselves, and they want freedom and safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And people will, if they’re not allowed to negotiate for it, they will try to take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And so people began to go illegally, and cross frontiers illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And transports from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  From yours as well, among the people you knew? </span><span class="sentence" id="781">That’s to say, inmates held at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  So how would you find out about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Would you turn up one day and there’d be fewer people? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Or did it work other ways?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  I know -- I know relatively little about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">They were small. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">People didn’t go in large numbers, to my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I remember one particular incident, let me concentrate on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We were told at the -- our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> that -- or we found out somehow, that there were a group of I suppose about 15 to 20 people being held in a <span class="BUILDING">British army post</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And I can’t tell you where it was, but it was a group of DPs who had been found crossing the <span class="DLF">Dutch frontier</span> illegally and they were now being held, and had been held for many months in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> when we eventually got there, we found that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was also a holding place for infamous war criminals and Germans who had -- who -- with a -- with a poor reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">So I went with the leader of the Jewish brigade, who drove one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> , and I think, too, we had another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> with -- or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , which would house another group, and a small, kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mobile ambulance</span> which was intended for the pregnant woman who was quite near term. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">So I think we probably had a nurse with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I can’t remember that, but I would imagine so, otherwise it would not be necessary or prudent to just have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">So I think we must have had a nurse with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So there were several of us, and when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> stood in the comp -- in the main kind of open <span class="REGION">area</span> , bef -- we -- we came into an open <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">On the left of us was this open <span class="DLF">camp site</span> with barbed wire, in which the Germans were standing or pacing. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And there was one woman, whose name I think has been given as Irma Grace, but I’m not sure if it was she, and I will check that for the record, but it was definitely a woman of -- who was well-known for her crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And -- and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> stopped, and we were to get out and go and negotiate with the British post, the inmates, the German inmates started to chant. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">They realized that we had come for, in inverted commas, the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And they began to chant, and it wasn’t a very friendly chant. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Something similar to do -- Jews, Jews, out with the Jews, but nasty stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I can’t remember the exact words, but it was very ominous, and the whole scene was very ominous. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And as we began to -- as we negotiated, and we received the people, and they were walking towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and we were loading them onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , the chanting got louder, and louder, and louder. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And my colleague said, “Start them singing, get them singing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And so they started to sing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">QUESTION:  The -- the Jews who you --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  -- had come to collect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And so, rather reminiscent of that film with Ingrid Bergman and -- you know, that famous “Casablanca” thing, but not dissimilar may I tell you, because the singing got louder and louder, and the chanting got louder, and it was extremely unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And I’ve never -- that scene, I -- I will never forget, because of it’s ominous nature, it’s pure, unadulterated hatred that was present, and the kind of slightly banal, rather semi-amused laid back attitude of the British soldiers from whom we were collecting the former inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And we took them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and the proud, pregnant lady haughtily rejected the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , and was most affronted. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , it trailed behind, and we had our two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we took them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And it -- th-there was some exuberance I remember, some -- some sense of release, relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And there was a lot of singing, but people were tired, and exhausted, and it was a long drive, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And I remember that there was a boy, young boy, and we held out our arms to help the people out of the -- out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> , and he refused that, and he jumped down. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And I -- I talked to him for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And when we got back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- because people needed to relieve themselves, I think we had food as well, we got back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , this young boy, as we dropped him off in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">compound</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> said to me, “You will remember me. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Remember me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And I said, “Yes, I’Il remember you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kownitz</span> , I -- I don’t know where or how, I can’t remember where I slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And I asked, I think, several days later where the group was, and I was told that they’d gone off again, and that this time they had crossed the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> and they had got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So not, I think, the pregnant lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Well, it may have been, but whatever, they had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">So yes, there were transports, and they behaved as all people do in these situations, with incredible determination and much courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Many died. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Some were shot crossing the frontiers as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But more than that, I don’t -- I can’t say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  Just pause it there for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I wanted to talk a little bit now about how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> functioned, how it was organized and -- and what people did all day whe -- when you first arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  You know, I’m not quite -- to be honest, I’m not quite clear about what people did all day as far as the inmates were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I think -- it wasn’t a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I worked in day in and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">My impression 1s that they did very little at the beginning because they were so vulnerable, so debilitated, it would be difficult to imagine an actual activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I believe that the more orthodox gathered and prayed, and went about their devotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I’m sure there was some activity, but there was very little structure to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">It was the emergence of Yosul Rosenzoft and Norbert Fallheim, and the establishment of a committee many months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And also with the presence of ORT providing workshops. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And I do have, and I w-will have to donate it at some time, a small pot, a small vase from some metal that was found somewhere, which someone gave me, which is one of the f -- one the early products of the er -- ORT workshop. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So people began to occupy themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">They began to form into their political and religious groupings. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">The <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was established and became one of the liveliest and the most exciting exponents of resilience and life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  Tell me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> would start with, nearly always as far as I remember, with a very raw just sort of exposure on the stage of the destruction of a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">The scene would start with the mother, father and children sitting round a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , very familiar <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And you can see that they were joyful, that they were engaged with each other, arguing, discussing, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And then you heard the marching toward the <span class="DLF">door</span> that would open on the family in which the Germans would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And you saw the family being beaten, being taken, you hear the screams, you see the mother being dragged away. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was played time and time and time again. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And it would be received in absolute silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">It was the homage to the family, to the destroyed family. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Whether it was a form of mourning, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It could -- it could have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage, letting the world know this is what happened to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I think it was more that than mourning, because it’s my view that many Holocaust survivors have never found the way to mourn such grotesque happenings as those that they witnessed and were part of. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So I think it’s probably to do with -- to do with exposure of what happened, and wanting the world and everybody to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And as the military government and -- and officials from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> were often invited to th -- these concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Not always, but -- but -- but especially so on some occasions, it’s not surprising that they would want to say this. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">This 1s, or was my family, and this is how it was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It was incredibly intimate, and terrible to watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And there was never any applause, there was only silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">But then there would be other things taking part. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I don’t remember all of it, but I remember that very often there would be a kind of cabaret element to it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or Polish, or whatever, really making fun of, and poking the finger at the establishment of the British rule, the British command and the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , the attitude to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="867">There would be - and it would be received with roars of laughter and applause, and at the end of which, of course, everybody stood up and applauded, including the front row of officials from the army, who’d hadn’t understood a word of this <span class="BUILDING">cabaret</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I think the cabaret was done very much in the old-fashioned kind of really sort of German style cabaret. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">You know, it was ironic, it was -- it was -- it’s meaning was very, very clear, and I believe it was very, very clever. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I didn’t always understand it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And so the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was very important, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was important, the workshops, the committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">The constant badgering for different individuals to move or do something, to go somewhere within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Other than that, I cannot really -- I cannot really remember other activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  How about the -- the newspaper, wasn’t there a newspaper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  Oh yes, there was a newspaper, of course there was a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Yes, there was a newspaper produced with again, factual and ironic comments about the life of the DP, and the life of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">No, th -- th -- there’s a newspaper, I wish -- I wonder if there’s ever any of this left. ’' </span><span class="sentence" id="879">ve never seen anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So much was of the moment, and you don’t think in terms of history, which one should. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Anyway, that’s how it was, as far as I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  So it went from being a rather desolate, to maybe quite a spirited <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It had its spirit, it had its resilience, it had its sense of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And I think that there was a group of younger people there who were going to survive at all costs. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Somehow survival and strength meant a great deal to them, and I think that they very often turned towards the idea of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> as their solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Whether the <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that we see now would have been different, I believe it might, but others don’t agree with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Had <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> taken people more readily and quickly, and quickly solved this question of people remaining within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that once abused them -- I mean, there’s nothing much worse than that, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Pretty awful stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">It may be a very simplistic way of looking at a very complex problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">But the sense of not being wanted, and the sense of not being a victim again, was prevalent. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I have seen it elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">To what extent do you think the work that you did, and the work that your colleagues did contributed to this resurgence of the human spirit, if you’d like, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="896">The one that you’ ve just described.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">ANSWER:  I find it difficult to make claims, I always do. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I think that we were part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We were part of the res -- I don’t want to use the word resurrection, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac -- something of the restoration of the human spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the people, something of the spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Okay, they were angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed and performed, and -- and -- and were quite remarkable in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I’m not taking responsibility for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I believe we played a small part in it, and I believe that we offered support and resources, and that probably, as is so often the case, we were responsible more for particular individuals being helped than we were for the kind of global picture, if you know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I mean, I can think of individuals, and I think of the German woman I spoke to, and who I had quite a lot to do with, and I think that without making too many claims, our relationship was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">The fact that she could speak to me about her husband, about her losses, and the fact that- no, I just feel somehow I can think of individuals that were helped by my colleagues, and on occasion by myself, but I don’t want to make too many claims about what we achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">QUESTION:  All right, well to get away from the claims, let me ask you about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Beginning, let’s say with a good --
ANSWER:  I think the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I think -- I -- I had less to do with the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but I think the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was valuable, and did a great deal for the individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  Tell me in what way. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I mean, you’ve spoken about one aspect of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , the fact that it was open to friends and relatives and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">ANSWER:  Mm, mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  But it -- when you say it was particularly important, in what way do you mean that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  Well, it was -- 1-it was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for recovery. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And it was of Jewish [indecipherable] and it wasn’t a <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">It wasn’t a <span class="BUILDING">British hospital</span> ostensibly, it was somehow manned by Jewish people helping Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I think that was very important because you are very vulnerable when you are helpless. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And they had been helpless many, many times, helpless victims at the mercy of others cruelty and lack of care, and lack of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I think whatever else we did or didn’t do, we did operate it well. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So I think that was a plus. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And I -- I can think of many individuals who were helped along by something. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But if you ask me were we responsible for all that renewal of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don’t think we were responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I think it came from the resilience of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Had we not been there it might have been more difficult, let me put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">That might be the fairest way to put it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">QUESTION:  Can you describe in -- in greater detail how your relationship with people developed, how when you arrived on this very desolate scene, how you made contact with people, how they reacted to you, and how, if at all, you -- you managed to establish some kind of dialog with them, and -- and draw them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Tell me how that process happened there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , as opposed to since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  I think in the early days -- I mean, this sounds very, again, rather trite, I think, and simplistic, but what I found was very important was to say very little, but to take somebody’s hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I -- I found that very important, and I sometimes find it important in my present day work. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">When there’s nothing to say and the situation is so terrible, all you can do is to take somebody’s hand and stroke it and hold it and try to indicate through your touch that there is a communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">So you don’t begin with words, you begin with touch, and that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And sometimes I would just walk away. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But it would be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so exhausted, that to take somebody’s hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person, trying to give strength, as it were, to the other person. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So that was all I could do sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Words came later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  And what happens when -- what happened when the words came, and what happened when you didn’t have a language in common with the people you were nonetheless communicating with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  Sometimes people would simply come out with a whole story in explosions. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I’ve -- I’ve said before like spitting up, like kind of vomiting something. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So that 1t would come out stacat -- come out in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in a coherent way. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And I would sometimes say either in German -- and I would always apologize for speaking German, and I would try to bring in Yiddish words that I’d learned, as much as I could, if I couldn’t understand somebody, because there would be other people there, and often people would sort of want to come to help you to understand the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">So that again is a form of communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">The fact that you don’t understand puts you in a less powerful position, therefore they have the power to inform you. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Without them, I can’t understand that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So that’s always a very useful way of looking at things, to accept your powerlessness, and let them have the power to inform you. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And I would ask for help from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  You’ve said, I believe, that sometimes you were -- they were angry with you, they didn’t want your sympathy, they wanted simply somebody to work out their anger on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">ANSWER:  Yes, well then, I mean, this 1s something you get in all -- with most survivors and something that you get y -- I -- I have to get used to in my present day work. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">People are angry because they are helpless and frightened and -- and they can’t see a way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And you just have to let them shout and be angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">There’s nothing else you can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">You don’t walk away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">QUESTION:  Did you have at the time any sense that you were achieving something? </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I mean, when you went back to the requisitioned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the end of the day, after a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Did you get blind drunk, did you hide under the sheets? </span><span class="sentence" id="956">What -- what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="957">How on earth did you live with this stuff day after day, and what sense did you have, had it been worthwhile, the day you just spent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  I never talked to anyone about it, and I think that was one of the failures in the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">It was born of it’s time when organizations were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things that they couldn’t achieve. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">So that organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more difficult the outside circumstances, the more institutions call upon the solutions for the institutions rather than for the people they’re there to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So we would look at, if we met in the evening, we would talk about the difficulties of transport, or the difficulties of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> being stolen, or an accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">But we wouldn’t talk about how I felt, or anybody else felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So there wasn’t much of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">What there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , that requisitioned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">We would sing, we would read poetry, we would read aloud to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">We would put on various -- we had one boy who was an extremely good mimic, and Richard Talbor was a very popular tenor of the day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of performing on the stage which was quite unique, and a little bit what can I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Little bit arrogant and pompous. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And so he would sing and perform and we would all act out something. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Or we would dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Now we would dance, we would have ballroom dancing, we were very good at this. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">We’d put on something or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">We had some very sentimental Italian songs, you know -- you know, I can’t even remember them now, but they were very sentimental, and we would all swoon, we would listen to music. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think, in the evenings, but we didn’t talk about our feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So my main relief would be laughing at somebody taking off Richard Talbor or somebody else for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And we’d have all those sort of activities, which was fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">QUESTION:  Privately, did you despair of what you were seeing day after day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t despair at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">When I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I went through a very difficult phase, one that I haven’t experienced since. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I -- I can’t explain what it was, it was an inability to work with what I’d seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I was absolutely terrified of a recurrence of that kind of happening, I was terrified of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And I was sure that it was going to happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I don’t know why I felt that, but I felt afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> and sit and watch film after film after film. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And I had traditional, classical panic attacks, when I would feel overwhelmed with fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">So a lot of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when I had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And it was partly fostered by the lack of interest by anybody around me in understanding or listening to what I had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">That was very difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I’d learned a lot of negotiating skills in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and in my family, but I hadn’t learned how to deal, and I still find it hard to deal with a bystander, to deal with people who know and don’t know, who don’t want to hear, and who didn’t want to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And I couldn’t bear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I came back to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of meat they were going to get that week, and any effort I made on my part to communicate what I’d seen, even when I was asked to give official talks about it -- I remember going to the east end and talking in a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> there to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I was actually asking for money, and that may have had something to do with it, but money for the relief -- the Jewish Relief Unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I still do that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And I had to ask for money and say what was going on, and I -- I mean, I met with cold, angry stares as much as to say, don’t you think we’ve suffered enough, we’ve heard enough? </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But I think it’s partly guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I know now that it’s guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And so that before you start, you have to try to reduce that sense of guilt with people that they couldn’t and didn’t want to do anything or know anything at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And they certainly didn’t then. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And I found that the hardest thing of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So I despaired when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I despaired when I came back, and I was really very low, the lowest I’ve ever been in my life, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Well, almost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">QUESTION:  What was it that made you decide to come back and made you decide to come back at a particular time? </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Maybe you could remind us of the date as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">What -- what was that one single thing or that -- were you just completely overloaded with what you’d seen and done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">ANSWER:  No, I’d been ill, I'd been in <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . ’</span><span class="sentence" id="1007">'d been involved in an accident which I’d had what they thought was concussion, I was quite unwell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And I came back on leave and it was decided for me, I didn’t decide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I had wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">In fact, I was dying to go back, I couldn’t wait to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And I think that partly my despair 1-in this -- in coming back, was due to the fact that I couldn’t go back there, and that I felt more at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there than I did here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And I felt more at ease there, and with myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And that was very hard for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">QUESTION:  Why did you feel more at ease?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">ANSWER:  I felt more at ease because I knew where I was, and who I was, and what I was doing, and what I was doing it for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And even if we were failing, or not doing a fantastic job, at least we were trying to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Whereas I came back to nothingness, to people who didn’t want to know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And that was -- that was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So I really found myself in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And the fact that it -- that things had changed, new people, new order had been set up out there, Henry was no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">It meant that it was difficult for me to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And in a way that was quite difficult for me, that whole scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">QUESTION:  Well, I mean it was two things as well, wasn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">It was unfinished business, and you hadn’t really said your goodbyes if you were expecting to go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">ANSWER:  [hadn’t said my goodbyes to anybody, I hadn’t -- I’d finished the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TB train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I mean, that was a job, that was a project that lasted many months, and that was the one thing I did achieve, whatever else I did or didn’t achieve, I achieved that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">So I felt quite good about the bi -- the -- the- the -- the fact that I’d got a -- managed to get a group of young children and adolescents to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for treatment of their TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">That was quite an achievement, you know, bearing in mind the difficulties that we were faced with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">So I felt good about that, but I didn’t feel good about leaving unfinished business, not saying goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I felt very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">It was bad, very difficult for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">QUESTION:  So when you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you found this kind of uncomprehending response, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">What -- what happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">ANSWER:  Well, there was a period which I really can barely remember, in which I wandered about, as I say, going to the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Sort of not knowing quite what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I eventually went to work for the Jewish Refugee Committee in their emigration department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And then finally, from there, I was asked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration Camps</span> , working with a group of young children and adolescents who’d been brought to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> whilst I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">They came here in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They were young people, orphans who’d been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And because of my background I was asked if I would be a caseworker with that organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">QUESTION:  Well, w-why don’t you tell me a little bit about that organization and the -- and the work that you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">We’re taking a little pause. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Before we move on to look in some depth at the work you did when you came back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , give me an assessment of what you, your organization, and people like you achieved in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">ANSWER:  I think that had it not been for Henry Lunzer, with his or -- with his sort of military organization, in setting up an administration, and an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that actually could operate within German, and particularly in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , but not only in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , in terms of provision, in terms of negotiation with British military government for the needs of different individuals and groups, I think that we would have achieved very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I think we -- and I think that his support of the need for children to go to the <span class="BUILDING">sanatoria</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was -- was good, and he gave me all the support -- moral support that I needed in order to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I think that he was misjudged, as is often the case, where you have a small -- where you have small resources, and you have a base in another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of purse holders and trustees, who have the reputation of the organization at heart, and want it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to have a view, a good overview of what Henry Lunzer was trying to achieve there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So there were inevitable, and there always are, I think, tensions, even in organizations today, which are well known, where the base is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">It’s very difficult to keep those communications clean and good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And it certainly was a handicap in -- in the -- in the Jewish Relief Unit at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1051">QUESTION:  Let’s move on now then, fairly swiftly to the work that you be -- began to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">ANSWER:  But I -- I did want to -- but I do -- I do really, at this point, want to pay tribute to Henry Lunzer because I think that he was a courageous negotiator and was very knowledgeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">He knew <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> well, he spoke German well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">He could speak to military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I think, you know, somebody needs to say he did a bloody good job, because he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Let’s talk then about the work that you did once you came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  Once I’d recovered my equilibrium, which took some months before I could actually face the world, really, I was appointed a case worker to the Committee for the Care of Children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration Camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I think I mentioned this a little earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">It was an organization sponsored and financed by the Central British Fund, and had a board of trustees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And it’s director was a practicing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, who I’d admired very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Who had been the director of a type of [indecipherable] institution in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , until he himself, as a Jew, was expelled and taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> before the war started, and finally released, and who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , or at least came to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> as a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And he was, as I say, a practicing psychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of the committee, a knowledge of institutional life, and of working with people who in turn were trying to care for what was considered to be a -- in the best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, a difficult or complex group of young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I came back in 1947, in the early months of 1947, so the children had already been, and -- or -- and adolescents had already gone through a kind of preliminary phase of being 1n special <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , where they were helped with language and many different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">By the time I got to work with them, they were looking at schooling, at advance study, at apprenticeships, and some kind of future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Again, we were looking at a very vigorous, articulate, demanding group of young people, competitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Now, they were very different in some ways from the people that I remembered from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Their survival, as -- as had the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but let’s just make this kind of -- let’s mark this difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young people I was working with had survived the daily selections for work, or for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , through their ability to maintain strength, to maintain totally focused on their survival, nobody else’s but their survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Although of course, some were concerned with friends and siblings, but basically focused on their own bodily survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">They had to prove their strength, their capacity to work another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So in dealing, in communicating with this group of people, one always had to have in one’s mind that that was how they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And there was never going to be an easy, immediate communication and trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">There couldn’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Nobody in their life really could be trusted for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So it was very important to find a way to build that trust, and to build a form of communication that took into account their need for their own <span class="INT_SPACE">private space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And this 1s quite important because I found it very important in working with them that -- for example, I -- I spoke about taking someone’s hand in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">What I found with the young people to be very important was to pi -- allow a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> between you and them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">A kind of actual, physical space so that -- and I -- I could never quite put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important to maintain that <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , but it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And I believe that it gave them a sense of their own kind of power base, their own sense of identity and strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And I did not invade it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">You were talking about the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and your approach -- you were talking about your approach to these young people, and how actually they needed precisely the opposite kind of approach to the people you dealt with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And a -- a -- this <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> was -- was a recognition, a kind of instinctive recognition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">It wasn’t something that I could put down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he was a guidance to me in many of the cases that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">But I just -- it was something that I just sensed as very, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Now, my job then was to try and help the young people to be placed in jobs, to begin a life that would be possibly creative, or would certainly give them some sense of solid -- solidity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">However, I have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to, so to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And I do feel that there was, in some way, a denial of need here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I believe that these young people -- and I’ve said earlier I believe, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the resources in time to mourn their dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And it’s not only to mourn their dead in the sense of their dying, but in the sense of their grotesque manner of dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And to mourn the grotesque is more complex, and needs skill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I don’t think that we had thought that through, and even if we did fumble towards an understanding that their inner world was not being addressed, such was the -- the kind of culture of the day, that the idea that -- you see, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> at the end of the war was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> blunted by war, where the message to everyone was to -- to just put the past to rest and let’s move forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">A new world is born, the war is over, let’s get on with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">That was the message of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Soldiers were not encouraged to speak about their inner fears and their nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">They were not encouraged to talk about the horrors of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">All the war films that came out were really like something out of Peter Pan, they were so -- so banal, and so sentimental. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So sentimental a -- you know, sa -- the war was sentimentalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">It wasn’t portrayed at that stage with all it’s horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And to bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the open was felt not to be appropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Now, I’m not saying that there wasn’t some attention to their inner world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I believe there was some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">The <span class="BUILDING">Anna Freud clinic</span> was involved in some way in observing the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">But I don’t believe that we dealt with the need to mourn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And when I look today at the -- at the older people as they are now, men in their 60’s and 70’s, women, and I look at their relationships and the next generation, I don’t believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">It’s easy to say that in hindsight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social terms, flourished, made good, married, had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">But if you observe them, and their relationships, and their long -- I don’t want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very supportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So, I mean, I went about my task of trying to help people, young people t -- into jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I negotiated yet again with <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> and most in a -- most unpleasant sometimes, landlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and employers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">It was a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">It had been a hard war, and people were tough, and employers were tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And the fact that these young people were -- I was just going to say asylum seekers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust survivors, it did not call for compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Some were good, some were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And many people worked well with the young people, and offered much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And there was a club, and there were facilities and money was sought for special needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">But I would have liked to have dealt better with some of the strange things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I had a young man, for example, who’d been -- who had TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And I went every week to see him here, in a <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brentwood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">He was a delightful young man from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">We spoke together, we talked about his needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We talked about all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">But one day when I went there, after many, many months of treatment, and he was doing very well, he wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And I was quite upset and I asked the nurses what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And they said he just got up and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Now he -- we don’t know what happened, and I still to this day don’t know exactly what the process was, whether it was long planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very enquiring of me as to why I hadn’t noticed a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">But such was the defense of this young man that he could converse week after week, and I could become quite close, and we could talk about quite intimate things, about sexuality, about the difficulty of being ill, about a possible girlfriend, all these things we could talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">But somehow he could, nevertheless, just g-get up and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So it’s that kind of thing where the defenses have been developed through crisis, through extremis, through the most terrible losses and catastrophes, and genocide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Where people have built defenses that are no longer so good in every day life, and do not make for absolute intimacy and trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And this is what I think happened with this young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">We ca -- w-we managed to speak about it later, but it happened, and it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">QUESTION:  One boy out of many, then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1138">ANSWER:  Well, I mean, he succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">He got better, he had a girlfriend in the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">No, I don’t think it was a total failure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">He was one boy out of many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">There was another boy I took, a very, very brilliant boy, who I’ve lat -- just recently found as a professor of chemistry in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I looked for many months, years in fact to find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">He had TB of the spine, and I wondered if he’d survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And I -- I took him before a group of headmasters in a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">north London</span> , because he was a very brilliant child, and we had wanted a particular standard of education for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">In coming before the headmasters -- it was a team of headmasters, to judge this young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I had to, of course, to say that the -- he had lost quite a number of years of his education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Brilliant as he was, he had lost years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And I explained that he’d been in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> slave labor, etcetera, etcetera, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And then the chair of the headmasters turned to me and said, “But didn’t they give them books to read?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And I was so aghast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I couldn’t believe it, and I couldn’t find anything to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Sufficient to say that the young man was taken into that particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But I’ve never forgotten that, and it’s an indication of society’s capacity to deny what is taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">But there was also denial amongst the Jewish community when I came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , as to what had happened to our brethren, to our brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And denial can exist in every population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">QUESTION:  Why did it exist among <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ’s Jewish population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">ANSWER:  I think it was partly guilt, that s -- si -- a -- si -- their own survival and other people had not survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I -- I shared that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I shared that feeling of -- of having survived when nobody -- you know, when other people did not, and you know, just by the luck of the draw, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Many of my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> indeed had not survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So -- my father’s relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So I think it was partly guilt, but it’s also denial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">If you deny something, you don’t have to do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">If you recognize something, you have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And you know, I’m faced with this every day, in my every day life now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">It’s the denial of society to accept that certain people have suffered sufficiently to require our attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And I think that’s what I felt when I came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">It wasn’t just the experience of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , of the people, of the ghastliness, of everything I’d seen and heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">It was the fact that when I came back I couldn’t get anybody to even unders -- want to -- want to understand what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And so this really is my -- my most urgent plea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">It’s not only about remembering the past, it’s about preserving the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And we can only preserve the future if we recognize what we are doing to each other, and what that means for the victims, and what we need to do if we’re to be a compassionate society.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">QUESTION:  Little pause here to allow us to --
ANSWER:  Oh, I thought that was the fi --
QUESTION:  When did you finish working with the boy survivors, and -- and what did you do next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">ANSWER:  I worked for many years, about eight years on and off with the -- the boy survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Of course, there were girls, we always called them the boys, but there were girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And I continue to stay in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">When I say I continue to work with them, the work finished probably after a -- a few years, I think, after about four years, but I continued to see them, and continued to work with them for a number of years after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And I still see them, particularly one or two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But I then went on to do some hospital jobs, social work jobs in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I joined Amnesty in 1961. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And I -- I just do want to say something about why I joined Amnesty, I know it’s not relevant, except to do with hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">It was very easy to hate one particular <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> , and one particular group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And I’d enjoyed, if I can use that word, or indulged in that hatred for many years, particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways, and seen his family destroyed in grotesque ways, and I -- at least his -- certainly his father, who was beaten to death in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which they were on the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">So living with his depression and his misery over the death of his mother, and rest of his family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek concentration camp</span> , I certainly nursed my hatred of the Germans for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">But it was when I began to realize that torture and other human rights violations were going on in so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">That the French were torturing the Algerians, that other people were torturing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">That you could not put -- you could not put a <span class="DLF">frontier</span> up and say this is where it begins, and this is where it ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I’m not making, and I’m not comparing one genocide, or one cat -- catastrophe with another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">The Holocaust will always remain the most terrible of genocides of the 20" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">But I still feel that we mustn’t close our eyes to other terrible disasters, such as we’ ve seen recently, for example, in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So I joined Amnesty [indecipherable] in the spirits, you know, with the idea that I can’t nurse this forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I have to accept and have to understand that violence and persecution goes on in many different forms, and I needed to understand it better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">My work in Amnesty went on for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I -- I helped to form the first medical group in the British section of Amnesty International, taking testimony and documenting evidence of torture and human rights violations from relatives and survivors who’d come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and in going on missions abroad for Amnesty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And it was coming out of that -- that work, knowing that we could document, and we could take testimony, and we could supply evidence of human rights violations to organizations and institutions concerned with human rights, including the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , but that we weren’t actually treating the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">That made me feel we weren’t really fulfilling our task. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And as people were beginning to ask us to take care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from many different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who look -- resided 1n this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and who’d been tortured and violated in many different ways, and lost sometimes, all their members of their family, that made me feel that we needed to move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">We established as an independent charity, the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture at the end of 1985. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And we had a vision, and visions are difficult to hold onto. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And the vision was to combine human rights, and the care of the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">In other words, to take heed of people’s protection, their human rights, to be part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">If necessary even to be advocates for that, which is not easy for therapists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">But also to look at the medical, psychological and social needs of the people who came from the -- to the medical foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">We’ve treated over 35,000 people, from over 91 different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and I have to tell you that my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> every day, my <span class="INT_SPACE">consulting room</span> every day, is filled with horrendous stories of torture, of deliberate mutilation, of hideous rapes, of dreadful executions from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">And I suppose really, that is the beginning and end, in some ways of my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I’m doing what I set out to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I know I can’t save everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I know that my own skills are limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">We’re an organization with no -- insufficient resources to meet the needs of everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I believe we live in as hostile an environment as -- or at least our survivors do, as they ever did in the 30’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">People are not welcomed, people are deported back to the <span

id="1216">So really, my work is again about human rights, and the care of the individual, and the individual’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And that can be very rewarding work, even if it can also be quite distressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1218">QUESTION:  Is there a thread that directly links your experiences at -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> with the Medical Foundation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">ANSWER:  I don’t think I would have established the Medical Foundation, and worked so long in the Medical Foundation if I hadn’t been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">What I learned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> was about a kind of suffering that we have never really begun to understand, about loss, about grotesque death, about the need to mourn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">About -- about despair and the desire to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I learned all of these things in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , but I also learned about the resilience, and something about the human spirit and people’s capacity to survive, and people’s capacity to overcome, if you are able to resource something within them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And that’s what I’ve learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I didn’t understand how to resource it for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">But with time, you are able to resource people’s skills, people’s -- you are able to retrieve something of who that person was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And that’s very, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">You are able to deal, or to try to come to terms with grotesque death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">To find ways of burying the dead that are very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And this we’ve had to do in the Medical Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">It’s about an holistic approach to trauma, and to loss, using medicine, using psychology, but also using very adaptive measures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">You can’t deal -- you know, you can’t bring a very traditional form of therapy very often to people from different -- from certain dif -- from different cultures, from different beliefs in healing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">You’ll have to listen to what is going to help them, and you have to find very creative ways of working with people, and I can give many examples of that, but I don’t think that that is the purpose of this discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I think the Medical Foundation has learned how to address government, it’s <span class="BUILDING">home office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">It doesn’t always succeed, but it tries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">It’s learned skills of negotiation and understanding other people’s difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">But how you hold the vision, and how you deal with continuing -- a continuing lack of compassion and understanding, both in the public -- or some of the public, not all of the public, we have quite a following, but in some of the public, and in some of government, is very difficult to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">QUESTION:  Now, on a slightly different tack, but not entirely, one aspect of the work that you’ve done for the Medical Foundation, I believe in June 1993, you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and you testified on behalf of a Palestinian prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Could you tell me about that whole case, and your involvement 1n 1t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  [ll tell you some of it, because it would take a lifetime to discuss it properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to take part with a colleague of mine who is formerly -- was -- was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but lives in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and works as a psychologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I went to attend a conference of the Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">The Medical Foundation does link to various human rights organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And because of my background, and because of the background of my colleague, it seemed very appropriate that we should link to something that sounded as constructive as an Israeli and Palestinian Formation for the Benefit of Human Rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">We knew, and had met the Israeli members of the organization, and the Palestinians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I had known and worked with for many years -- that means to say, when I say worked with, I mean I’ve communicated with a very profound child psychiatrist from <span class="COUNTRY">Gaza</span> who studied in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and is working with the Gaza community mental health team in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gaza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">So it seemed a logical thing to do, for us to attend the conference, which regrettably was on the subject of torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Torture worldwide, torture throughout the world, but torture also in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And when I was there, I was asked by the Physicians for Human Rights if I would help them in the case of a Palestinian where it had become obvious from the papers that had been found of his interrogation, that he had been tortured in order -- in order for him to confess, whether I will be prepared to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And I met the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer involved in his case before I made any decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And I was very impressed with his integrity, and his dignity, and his desire as an Israeli to provide fairness and justice where he felt 1t was appropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">On reading the document, it was obvious to me that certain forms of what we would call torture had taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And I agreed, reluctantly may I say, to, as a visiting director of an organization concerned with torture, to take part in a certain aspect of his trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">It -- it was agreed -- it was agreed with the lawyer that this -- I mean, it was at the lawyers request that I acquiesced to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">And I produced a document, and I attended the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number four, side B, of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1256">ANSWER:  And so we went -- I went with the -- with the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer, and my colleague who had come with me and escorted me from the <span class="COUNTRY">UK</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hebrum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">It was extremely hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And we had to wait for many hours because the judge was not happy about my giving any evidence in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And I think that she, quite understandably, had to take advice from other authorities before she could proceed, and she went on really for many hours before eventually, I was allowed to come into the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and to give only very restricted information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I could not refer to certain aspects which they considered I was not qualified to refer to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">So, my role was rather a limited one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">But I could talk about confessions under torture, and that confessions under torture can never be reliable ones, for quite obvious reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">That people will often say something in extreme discomfort that isn’t necessarily true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And as torture is universally outlawed, it does seem rather inappropriate for any <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to take, to accept a confession that actually took place under coercion, and under extreme pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Before I went to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , I sat for some time in a very small, hot flat, without air conditioning, to see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick, smelly, kind of wooly, wool material, army material hood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">I didn’t have such an exact hood, but I had sufficient to give me a feeling of how claustrophobic, and how terrible such a feeling would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I wasn’t able to adopt the position that 1s adopted, that was adopted, and is -- is often used in such cases in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , where somebody is placed on a low <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , their hands tied behind them, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> ’s feet are shorter in the front than the back, so that the -- when you are hooded, and exposed to quite a lot of noise, loud noise, and you are also in this very uncomfortable position, sitting on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , which has a traditional name, which I shall remember soon, I think if anybody were to try that position, they would find it extremely uncomfortable, because the weight of the body is distributed in such a way that there’s enormous pressure on the back, and one is in extreme discomfort and fear, and exposed to noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Man also had an injury that had been recorded in the notes, but which I was not allowed to refer to in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , which was an injury to his nose, which the doctor had recorded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Now, I -- it’s difficult for me to discuss this particular case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">It so happens that the case was resolved, inasmuch as an expert came from -- an expert in confessions under pers -- under duress, came from the <span class="BUILDING">Mordsley hospital</span> as an independent expert, and gave evidence in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">QUESTION:  A <span class="BUILDING">British hospital</span> , that is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">ANSWER:  Yes, a <span class="BUILDING">British hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Because, as they professed to be uns -- not satisfied with my credentials as an expert witness, I did suggest to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , that if they were concerned, as they said they were, to ascertain whether the man had confessed under torture, then perhaps the best way of doing it was to get somebody whose expertise could not be denied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And so this was agreed, and eventually an expert, as I say, from a renowned institution, and whose seminal work is in confessions obtained under duress [indecipherable] attend the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And the man’s sentence was commuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Is 1 -- 1s that the word? </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">From I think 15 years, which was his convicted -- was the- was what he was convicted -- was what he was given on conviction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">But I think it -- he w -- did -- it was then --
QUESTION:  Reduced, or --
ANSWER:  Reduced to a very short period, and he was released quite soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">It was a very, very difficult experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">For me, with my background, to stand in <span class="BUILDING">Israeli court</span> , defending a Palestinian, who was there, and who looked extremely fearful, and obviously with a -- some -- well, was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">But it was much harder to do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">If had done nothing, I could never really have lived with my principles, which is that nobody, under any circumstances should be signaled out for torture, and that there are other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">If you do want information, you have to find, with all the ingenuity that exists within societies, other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">But you do not torture, you do not torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Torture is such an abominable, devastating experience, both to those who practice it, I believe, in the end, and those on who it 1s inflicted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">It is really the most terrible memory that la - that -- that man can have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And the nightmares, and the physical pain, the sense of one’s own betrayal -- the body betrays in torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">The body gives out, and the body betrays you in torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And for a civilized <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , for civilized people to be practicing torture on an individual is unforgivable, and cannot be condoned under any circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And I know there’s a great discussion going on about -- at the moment about whether torture is justified, and others must indulge in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">But my views are clear, and my experience of working with survivors 1s that they- they do not -- it is very difficult to overcome, just as it is with Holocaust survivors to overcome the effects of torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">And for -- to employ people to torture as your agents is, I think the s -- beginning of a very slippery slope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">If you employ people to torture, or to apply as they say, minimum pressure, or whatever the phrase is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">It doesn’t matter what the phrase is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">What it means is to frighten through physical and psychological pain into a confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">It’s no way to behave for a civilized society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">And there are people in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who feel very, very unhappy, very uncomfortable about what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And torture does exist, I’m afraid, in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And I have been witness to a number of testimonies of people who’ve been tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And it’s an unbearable thought, but I think that we have to -- I take heart from the fact that there are people in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who are working very, very hard to find a way to end this, and who’ve spoken out very courageously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I wish there were more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">I know that there’s a great deal of fear, but I don’t with to get into the political scene in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">People have elected their representatives, and they have made a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">I with there was not so much hatred against the Palestinians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And I wish the Palestinians would not do what they are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">I’ve worked with moderate, and intelligent, and caring Palestinians and Israelis who come together and want to bring about change, and it’s our job to help them do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Not to be defensive about what is going on there, but rather to look for a solution, I think, as to how we as individuals can assist people to bring about change in their societies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">It is about the way people lose it, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1309">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a final question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">What lessons can you draw so far from your rather extraordinary life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1311">ANSWER:  I don’t know whether it’s extraordinary, I -- I would question that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">But I -- I think really, my concern, what -- what worries me most is lack of compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I think it’s so easy to turn against people, to create scapegoats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">I mean, no -- no nation, no group of people can be more conscious of that than the Jewish people, how easy it is for them to be scapegoated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">They always have been, and they’re still being scapegoated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">But we have to be careful about this, and we have to be informing all the time, people about the need to understand other people, to be compassionate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">We’re not a compassionate society here or anywhere else that I can see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And we can do so many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">We’re now going off to <span class="NPIP">Mars</span> , and to the moon, and here and there, but we don’t know how to maintain compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">What I saw happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> was the dying of compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">There was outrage and compassion when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated, but I watched it die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I watched it not there when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And when I speak today to people -- I watched it in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> where children, in my view, were really abused, and restrained, when they should not have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I don’t mean -- when I say abused, I mean cruelly treated, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Stupidly treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">I just -- I just -- I mean, for example, when the Kosovan refugees came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- we can question why, but people came to the <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> with teddy bears and presents, and there was all kinds of support and interest in their welfare, particularly families with small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">People were able to identify them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">But even though they were able to identify them, the compassion is gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">If I say today that my own government is considering sending back a Kosovan family, who we feel, for reasons of torture and rape and various other situations, really should not go back, but should be allowed to stay, there won’t be that compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">The compassion has died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And so I don’t know what maintains compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And I don’t know how to help people or to instill compassion in people when they’ve lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And I think that is really the predicament for s -- f -- f -- and always has been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">It’s about being compassionate to the people who are so different from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And even people you may not like very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">I mean, I don’t like all my clients, I don’t have to, it’s not my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">I remember when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I said on one occasion to a much more experienced colleague, my God, I’m so tired of -- there’s one particular person that drove me literally -- drove me quite mad, and was very demanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And he said, “Look, you’re not here to like people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">You’re not here to like them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And that’s quite true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">I’m not doing this work because I like everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And I don’t expect to, and it would be foolish for me to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">But there has to be a degree of compassion if we’re to deal with the ills of society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">I can’t finish it. ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">ve come to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">I don’t know, it sounds like a sermon from God knows where. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">I don’t intend it to sound like a sermon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">It’s not like that, but ’ ve watched compassion die so quickly, I just -- it’s just a plea for some kind of understanding that isn’t there.</span></p>
