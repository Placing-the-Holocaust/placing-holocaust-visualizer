<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Bella, could you give us your full name and where you were born and what year you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name was Bella Pasternak. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born Breock (ck) Simon Autashore (ck), <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania.(ck</span> ) Later on it became Orderra (ck), because when <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> take it over, it became a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Can you tell us something about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you were growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">What year did you --
ANSWER:  I was born November 7th, 1928. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was a seven-month baby, and I was born the seventh child. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We were two boys and five girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was three-and-a-half kilometers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city Dasch</span> (ck), and it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , mostly non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">The population -- the Jewish population in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was approximately 25 or 30 families when I was a small child. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">But we used to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We had a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ; we had a <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> ; and my father was a blacksmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> here, where he learned a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In the early 1900 he came over as a young fellow, and he was partly -- he was talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and partly about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">When he left behind his girlfriend, he went back in 1912 or 1911 -- or 1912 to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">At that time the war broke out and they didn't let him come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Despite he had the papers and the passport, they recognized him as a Hungarian -- as a citizen born there, and he had to go into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">By the time he came out from the Army, his passport expired and, therefore, he wasn't able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And many times through the years that we were there, the passport was validated, and whenever -- it was validated, the government changed, and we were never able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Even in 1940 we had all the passports to come over, but then <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> came in and they didn't recognize any papers from around the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very small as far as the population, the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But we did have a <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> , a small <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> , and we had people that came from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to teach us Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We went to classes from the morning, early in the morning we went for Hebrew classes, and then we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> it was a very -- in the beginning it wasn't bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But then they started just like here in the pogroms (ck). </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There was Krousa-coger (ck), just like the iron guard, who prosecuted the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And they used to call names like: Jew, go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But as far as more the situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we lived, we didn't see. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And in four years I made seven grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">After seven grades there were no more classes in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But my mother was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father was more modern, because he was already an American, so he found the taste of modernization. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My mother came from an ultra-orthodox family, that they shaved their heads, and they really kept it very, very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Whatever the Rabbi said, that's what -- written in the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So when I won the scholarship, it took time. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They said I could go for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And then my father says: Look, we're not sending her. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">If they send her, let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Finally, then it came through, Hungarian took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The Hungarian --
QUESTION:  Would you stop for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">What do you mean; what scholarship did you win?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  I took -- the scholarship that I won, it was -- they had statewide scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They had a test in math, in history and in geography. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I was the youngest one, because I made seven grades in four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So -- but I won in all three: In math, and history, and geography. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So then they said that they would give me a special admission to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> free -- for <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">college</span> free. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But my parents were so religious that our boys did not go to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They went to <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My brother went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He went to <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> and visits the Rabbi, <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He become a Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And the girls went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- and to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So when I won the scholarship -- and my father said to my mother: We're not sending her. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">If they are sending her, let her learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Because my father did not speak the language, because when he was born it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Then he was in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> where he picked up a little English, and he came back it was <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So wherever he went, I went along with him, because he didn't know what he was signing. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The language was altogether different. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">From Hungarian to Romanian, it's a different -- altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Romanian is Latin, and Hungarian is a different language. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So I used to go along with him, and he used to kid around, and he said: Here comes my lawyer, to let me know if I could read it or not, or to sign it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">She will read it to me, and then I'll sign that if I could sign it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">When <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> came, we were a little happy from the beginning, because we figured there wouldn't be no more the iron guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My mother remembered that she was born in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; that the Hungarian people were pretty nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And it was all right from 1940 until 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">In 1941 it became a new law. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Jewish people weren't allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So my scholarship, first of all, wasn't good any more, because from -- <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> become <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I had to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and start with A, B, C. A different language altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">After learning one year, we were expelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We had to wear a Jewish star, and it was forbidden for Jews to go at night out, and to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So I went in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that time, and I started to learn a trade, because my father, to rest in peace, he always said: No matter how much money you have, you always have to know a trade, and you have to know to do even for -- we had a girl coming in to wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , she used to make us all do something to make sure that we all knew how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">In the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we were a lot of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Some of them were away in <span class="BUILDING">Yeshivas</span> , but we were a happy family. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Like my father was working, he was a blacksmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So in the beginning he used to work with 12-13 people, because he had people coming from all over for the backsmith work, and also was making the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">At that time there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> were made with wood, and he used to carve the wheels, but he -- he practiced, and he knew very well to make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">He had workers in that department, and then he went in the other department where he used to put shoes on horses, and he put the iron and the wheels from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">When <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> came over, he was still doing that, and even towards the end he was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">In 1942 the situation got really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Everything was rationed: Milk, flour, sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You were allowed to get one pair of sole in your shoes one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Everything that we had was sent to the Army, or even but -- what we didn't have -- if we didn't have it, they told you you had to deliver that. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and buy it, and deliver it for pennies. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But being you were a Jew, you had no other choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> compared to the rest of the people there, because my father when he came from the <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , after he couldn't -- wasn't able to come here, he bought land. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And he bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we had a six-room <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So they taxed everybody according to their property. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So, we had <span class="REGION">acreage</span> that they used to give out for people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to work on it, and whenever they came out with the corn or with the wheat, we used to share it. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Half was there for the labor and the other <span class="NPIP">half</span> was for us, because we keep the <span class="REGION">land</span> , and we give them the seeds for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Then they taxed them to such an extent that it wouldn't pay to give it out to workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He finally give it to the workers, and the workers used to give us wheat or whatever from -- just for the ground, but the ground was written over to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Then in 1942 it came around the Jews were paying more taxes than anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">If you made money or you didn't make it, they tax you. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So one day they came in and they said: You have a six-room <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You have to pay so much and so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My father, he should rest in peace, took a hammer and made five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He knocked the <span class="DLF">hole</span> out. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He says: You see, now I only have five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He says my taxes -- because it was impossible to pay the taxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">No matter how well you were, in the end you become poor, because no matter what you have, it wasn't enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Then everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I started -- I started to play the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I used to buy stuff and take it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where everything was available for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I become very friendly with the head of the police, the captain of the police, and he was Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">There we had two kind of police in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Some of them were called Rangles (ck) and some of them where called Chandles (ck). </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The Rangles (ck) were the local ones, that it was established there. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The Chandles were coming from other areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Once I got arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We didn't know -- I spent the night in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> when I was 12 years old, because two people rode the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Everything was reserved for the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I rode from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the three miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">A fellow pass by and he says: You want a lift <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I was sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , the Chandles (ck) come, they saw us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We both spend the night in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> because we rode the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Whatever we did we didn't even know, because there was no radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">There was no newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Everything was forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Not only for the Jews, for the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The news there was like this: One guy went on the drum and announced this time everybody has to take the cows out, or things, because they're coming to take for the Army whatever they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So we had buffaloes. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Trained -- you know, trained buffaloes that the milk was very, very good from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I used to do <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I used to take them everything from eggs, sugar, zachery (ck), anything that you could normally disguise by wood by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They used to buy us things to make the matzos. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">For Pesach -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Purim</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> , they used to bake in our large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they used -- lunch for where my father made. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We'd make matzos for the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Everything was available for money that we made from the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So I befriended myself with the head of the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And in order for me to be able to do that, I used to give him percentage. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He used to get milk, eggs, chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Anything that I dealed with, he used to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We become very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">As a matter of fact, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he told me: Look, the situation is getting very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">You leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I told them the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Nobody wanted to believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They said: How in the world can you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We were comfortable just like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We work. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We gather money that somebody's going to come and take you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Nobody wanted to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I said: Look, remember when it was forbidden to kill for kosher, only once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And my uncle, my mother's brother was a butcher, and they caught him killing for -- slaughtering the meat for kosher in a different day. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So the Rabbi that slaughter it and my uncle was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So I went to the captain, my friend, and they got off from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I said: Look, remember when I got them off from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , because he knows me, he told me -- he done favors for me, because I do favors for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Whatever I give him, I didn't take any money, because if I would have take the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> money, I would have been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And for the money that I give it to him, it didn't pay, because it's like for five dollars to five cents, so I figure it's better I give him a gift than to charge him. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So, Friday before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started, he told me: Look, you are 40 miles from the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell your parents to pack and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Well, Friday I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said to my mother and father: Look, the friend of mine, the captain says: The situation is very bad and it's getting worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">One, we have a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We should go over 40 miles to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My father had two brothers that lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , because when we were there it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; and he had a sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He said: Take whatever you can and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">When I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told -- my mother and my father, they went to <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> Friday night and Saturday, and they discussed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Well, they said: Now I think she is going too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I know she has connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I know she took us out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I know that whatever she is planning she could do, and he goes along with her, but this is a little too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You see, when he said that, everybody was staying put. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The Rabbi said, the shucta (ck) said to stay put. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So it came Tuesday morning, when we started to bring people from -- for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We were only three and a half miles to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The other people, that they were further, the Chandles (ck) used to take them in little carriages and take families. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So I said to my mother Tuesday morning, I say: You see, you didn't believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">You see already they are taking these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So my mother used to say: Well, they were business people. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Maybe they did something wrong and they caught them, and they're taking them for questioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I didn't want do Tuesday morning nothing, no chores around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because we had to feed the ducks, the chickens, the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Everything everybody had -- you know, when you were a large family, everybody had the chores before they go any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I says: I'm not doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I said: You wait and you will see what's going to happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So finally they knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they say, you have five minutes to get whatever you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Give me your jewelry and give me your money, and be ready in five minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We -- my mother at that time looked at me, and I didn't say nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So we packed little things that you take: A blanket, a pot, a milchig pot, a fleishig pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And my father was doing the horses, too, for the Germans, because we had two Germans that lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Two officers lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was even -- if we had only five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , it was still the biggest <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So whenever an officer came, they used to say -- there was no <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> -- your <span class="INT_SPACE">master bedroom</span> was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My mother and father had to get out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and they were there for a month, living there because they had maneuvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">This was German people, officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They were very polite. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They were staying in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">My father was taking care of the horses, and they used to like our cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">My mother used to cook them breakfast and everything, and they used to pay us for it, and they enjoyed the home cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They never said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">My father, they were waiting until he finished the horses, to shoe the horses, and then they gathered us in one big, in a big <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And they said when they gathered the whole group we start marching to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which was approximately four and a half miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Could we go back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  You are 12 or 13 years old and the Hungarians take --

<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  What is going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  We were afraid of them, because they stopped once and they -- one offered us a lift during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">We were the ten of us going together. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They say: You want a lift? </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Well, we Said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">One girl was up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and they start rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So we pulled her down, and she was full of -- bleeding from her knee, because we pulled her down, and she fell on her knee, and we never took any lifts after. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">From then on --
QUESTION:  What was she -- could you explain then, what was he doing to her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  Nothing he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">When she was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , he started rolling with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">He didn't wait for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">When the one girl was there, he started the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So we grabbed her by the hand, and this is the way we pulled her down from the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And I said: From now on no more lifts from the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">We have to learn to go by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And I said: We have to learn to sleep during the day and run at night when they are not around. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">We were so afraid -- we were afraid from the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I -- almost as much from the Germans.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  Did you see evidence of that or --
ANSWER:  No, there were rapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">There were a lot of girls who saying that they were raped. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I know many people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> who were raped from the Russians after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And there were many people who were raped from the Germans while they were there at gunpoint. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So we were afraid for that more even for the Russians than from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">The Germans, you have no choice, but now I figure you could run, and we started running at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">At night we were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">During the day, whatever we were able, we stole from here and from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Whatever we find, we ate, and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">We went like that, stealing and going from January ‘til March until we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">When we were in <span

they give us -- put us -- and they called right away from there on the telephone to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because it was occupied by the Russians, but they had the Jewish leaders from the UJA. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">They had Jewish leaders in every <span class="NPIP">part</span> , and they told them that we coming, and there is a group of ten. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and we went to <span

class="sentence" id="965">And we went straight into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And the first thing I remember is they put us on ice, because we were frost bitten. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And that I remember -- I couldn't understand, we were frozen and everything, and they put us on ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And they did give us pig to eat, and there was no kosher, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They gave us the smoked pig to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Then they opened a <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish kitchen</span> , from the joint in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">We were there at that time, people were coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">They were traveling back and forth looking for family, and we went to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to find the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Nothing in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Every

class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">So we went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and we figure we start all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">There was one <span class="NPIP">place</span> with a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and that they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> -- better <span

id="1046">We were -- after the liberation we were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and a double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , but no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Only <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to move around to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span
