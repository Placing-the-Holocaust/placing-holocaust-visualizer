<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  ..spoiled childhood until the Anschluss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  Tell us about the spoiled childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Well, we had a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My father was an avid book collector. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">We had over 10,000 first editions. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Uh...My mother and I would frequently go on vacations, and my uncle had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We would go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We would go on ski vacations 1n the Austrian Alps. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We made trips to my mother's home country of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was just a...you know, I had all...I had all the things that a little girl my age could want.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Tell me about...uh...<span class="BUILDING">school</span> and your playmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  I don't remember...I don't remember too much about...I have very hazy...hazy memories about that, but...uh...everything changed with the Anschluss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Why...why is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Uh...Even though I was only 8 years old at the time, I...I did notice there were, you know, the changes I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Men with arm bands, SI and SS going through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I would...and they told me that these were bad people. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And then I noticed that they would single out especially well dressed women to...uh...do menial jobs, clean out <span class="BUILDING">lavatories</span> and work on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And then a law was passed that all Jewish children had to go to a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">segregated school</span> if you will, and...uh...and I noticed there was a total change of attitude in my classmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">All those kids who had been friends of mine suddenly turned against me and started calling me names, started calling me dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I was not unhappy to leave, but then events...uh...happened so quickly that I never did get a chance to...uh...g0 to a <span class="BUILDING">segregated school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And the other thing I noticed that the....you know, the words ...the yellow star, and the word J appearing on the <span class="BUILDING">window shops</span> , you know, shopkeepers and various <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But it was all...1t was all very bewildering. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I just knew that something really bad had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  What about your parents in all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Did you see a change in attitude at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They suddenly became very worried, and there were a lot of family hush conferences behind closed <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And then one day the Gestapo came to our...it was shortly after the Anschluss, the Gestapo came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and took my father away for questioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And all I knew...I didn't really know what was happening but my mother just said, "Those bad men came and took daddy away," and she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And my father was gone for 3 days and we had no idea where they had taken him to or whether we were ever going to see him again and then he finally did come back and he look rather bedraggled. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And then there was another hurried conference and with my grandparents who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and some close friends, we decided that...or my parents decided we had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and that our only chance was to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and it was really a last minute decision and very hurriedly we decided to leave everything behind and just pack a couple suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I remember the one memory that I have is my mother telling me that I was to go to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and just pick the few toys that I wanted to take with me and to be fast about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I remember that I was started piling up a whole pile of my favorite dolls and mother came and she said, "Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">You can't take all this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And she picked two dolls, and she said, "You can take two dolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Period.” </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I was crying, you know, didn't really...I felt it was terribly unfair to do this to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And so we just...they just threw some clothes in suitcases and...uh...we went and said goodbye to my grandparents and...uh...that was the last time that I...I was to see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at night and...uh...went to...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I remember the only recollection I have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stopped at the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and there was a period of anxiety. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I could see that my parents were extremely nervous, but everything went fine and we actually made it safely to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> about...was about the end of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And we were trying to start a new life. (</span><span class="sentence" id="42">Sigh) And, of course, it didn't work out this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We...we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and...uh...my father was...succeeded in finding some work again as a journalist and rented a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Uh...My mother...my grandfather on my mother's side had succeeded in going to...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So he had invited us to come over and we made a one-month's trip to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , visited him and we came back to...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was enrolled in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was correspond about the 3rd grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Didn't speak French at the time and I...I was just thrown into a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> with the other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was sink or swim, but...uh...within a matter of months I picked up the language and felt quite comfortable and
QUESTION:  Slowly down if you would a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  I would like to know what those few months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were like for you as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Well, at first there was the sheer wonderment. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">You know, it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It was an extremely exciting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It's a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And there was so many...so many things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And there were so many sights and sounds, and also the fact that I really did not know the language and the way I learned it is my parents would send me to the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and they would say what I was to say because they know...knew a little bit of French. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I would repeat it and it felt strange to...you know, I was saying things I didn't really understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Uh...But in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , everything seemed to be going alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">You know, there are a lot of memories that are not so distinct from that period so there are just little glimpses here, you know, like little cameos here and there that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I...uh...did find one good friend in my age and we used to pal around and just walked around in the nearby <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and went to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">You know, things that kids our...our age do. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But...uh...that's about all I remember until....until the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And...uh...then again, we...we started hearing rumors of impending war 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And...uh...we started hearing about air raids, and I remember that at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...you know, we were told we would all have to get gas masks. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And so they lined us up and they fitted us with gas masks and I thought it was just horrible, horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They gave us a big long, lead box which we carried a mask in and we were to carry them with us at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And...uh...the one thing I remember 1s just the suffocating, real disgusting smell of rubber that emanated and the fact that I had a feeling that I was choking. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And then...uh...we had air raid drills and my father had cautioned me and said, "You know, if you hear a noise and noise like a siren...if it should happen in the middle of the night, don't be frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Just get dressed very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It means we all have to go down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And...uh...one night I actually did hear the noise, and I went to my dad's <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I said, "Daddy, is the noise where we have to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And he said, "Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I said, "Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So we...we did go and there was a...there was an air raid and, you know, and we were just sitting there in the damp <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> and everybody wearing a gas mask. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was really a sight out of science fiction almost, and one time there was an air raid while I was at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And all my teacher all herded us into the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> and the bombs started dropping. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We could hear them <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we were terribly frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And when we came out, you know, we were wondering, you know, was...was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> going to be there? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Were my parents still going to be there? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It was a very....you know, it was a lot of anxiety. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Uh...And then as the Germans were approaching, you know, the French wanted to deny access so they...they blew up...they were going to blow up some <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , but they decided against it, but they blew up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">petroleum tanks</span> and the personal recollection I have that on that day when they blew up the pet...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">petroleum tanks</span> the town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sevran</span> which 1s just across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> __ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My mother and I had been out shopping and it started to rain and suddenly the rain became down was a black gooey kind of rain very, you know, like oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And so what had happened apparently is that the oil from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> had mixed with rain so it was falling down, was almost pure oil and when we got...our clothes were just totally ruined and when we got to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , the curtains were all black and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And they cautioned us not to drink the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And just as we came 1n, I had drunk a glass of water and then the announcement came over the radio, "Don't drink the water.” </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I was just terribly frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I thought, "Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I'm going to die.” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And the little girlfriend who happened to be visiting said to comfort me, "Oh, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">You're not going to die right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Just in a couple hours maybe.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="92">Laughing) And...uh...then at that period when the Germans were very close, you know, there was an exodus that we couldn't...we couldn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">My father was drafted into the...uh...an arm of the...of the French army which was four foreign nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And first they sent him to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , and again he was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We didn't know where he went, whether he would come back and...uh...we...we took us...we finally got word of where he was held and they had put him into another <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...uh...in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> called______—_—, and he was working there I...we found out as a cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And it took us...my mother and me several weeks before we were allowed to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We would go there early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We would stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting to be let in with the other wives and children, and then they'd say, "Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Come back tomorrow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And this was going on for several...several weeks and we finally got to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And he was actually working as a cook because as a Viennese, you know, they thought he could make some pastries. (</span><span class="sentence" id="102">Laughing) And he said he'd been fairly...fairly well treated, but then he was transferred again to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we didn't know again for a long time where we had...he had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And then...uh...we got news that they had put him to do...uh...street work, and he was working with...uh... you know, an ax and a shovel and he had gotten blood poisoning from the friction. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You know, dirt had gotten into it and he was near death at that point and a...uh...one of his fellow...uh...workers just took a kitchen knife and opened the wound and drained it and saved his life, so they did discharge him and he came back to us looking, you know, very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And then he got word that he would be transferred to a...uh...a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in...uh... somewhere in south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We...we didn't know where he was going to be and just remembered that one thing, he took me on his knees and he said, "How would you like your daddy to be a soldier?" </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I...[ said, "Well, does that mean you're going to have to go away?" </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And he said, "Yes," and I said...and I started to cry and I said, "Oh, Daddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Please don't leave me with Mommy because Mommy is so nervous.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="110">Laughing) And..but he did...he did go and...uh...I remember that after he left, the...we were still...we had a pretty nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a nice area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , but things were...had turned really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And then the Germans actually, actually came in to the...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and on the day...just on the day that they marched in, I had gone out shopping and a woman came running over to me and she stopped me and she said, "Honey, don't go any further because." </span><span class="sentence" id="112">German SSS ich was on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The Germans are on the ____, and please we have heard horror stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">You know, they would butcher children and rape women and so everybody was just terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So I ran back in and told my mother and I wouldn't go out unless...uh...my mother was with me and as soon as they came, we noticed that things got to be extremely bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">All the food disappeared and everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We could only obtain things on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , but we had no money so we weren't able to buy anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We had...winter came. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We had no...no heat and things just went from...from bad to worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And at...at that period, you know...uh...the...uh...you know, after the Armistice was signed and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was divided into two <span class="REGION">regions</span> ...uh...we were in the <span class="REGION">occupied region</span> and my father, when he was in <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> , was in what was still the free, the unoccupied zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And he start...he wanted us to join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">At first, of course, when he went there we...we didn't know where he was, and we finally got word that very... The news...news was scarce because news was censored. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You weren't allowed to write letters, so all you could get were preprinted cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And on the cards, you had to fill out....you know, they had preprinted sets of statements and they would say I am in good health; sick or dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And you have to check off what you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then it said, "I haven't heard from...and there was a blank for that, and...uh..something like, you know, I don't...I forget, but it was very sketchy and so you had to use your ingenuity to kind of convey the message, so I just maybe my father finally managed to tell us where he was in case that we should try to...to join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And then we got word that he had managed to get a visa for all of us to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and he said, "Please, just do anything to get out of there.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="128">Sigh) But as fate would have it, I came down with the measles. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I was very ill, and by the time I recovered the visas had lapsed and already, and we had lapse...lost our last chance to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I always think, you know, something a trick of fate you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The...the measles. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And could have avoided the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So that...so that chance was lost and by that time there were no more passages to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">A friend...some very close friends of ours had actually left on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we had gotten reports that the Atlantic was mined and it was just, you know, too dangerous to even attempt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And then the Gestapo paid us another visit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">When they came...and they came asking for my father and my mother said, "Well, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I don't know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And he said, "Well, how come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You know, she said, "I don't know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And he said, "Well, do you have any letters from your husband?" </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And she said, "No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And he said, "What kind of wife doesn't keep letters from her husband?" </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And she said, "Well, I just didn't keep them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And then they wanted to know the whereabouts of...uh...friends of...of my father's. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And...uh...my mother said she didn't know anything and so they pulled out a list and she said, "We...okay, you don't want to tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We'll tell you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And they started rattling off name on.... "We've never heard of him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And then they started searching the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they just removed everything from <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They took drawers, overturned them, you know, just looking for any kind of document. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Anything that would have been helpful to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Then they started going through the bookcase and they start throwing down books and my mother knew that in one book, she had actually kept the names and addresses of friends of ours which we would have needed had we...you know, if we were able to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We had a...that was our way to contact them. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And they stopped short of that one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookcase</span> where that particular book was. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They just gave us their search, and just stopped short of that one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookcase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So my mother kind of breathed a sigh of relief, and then they almost apologetically said, "Well, you know, we had orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We had to do this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And at one point I remember...it's just...a little child recollection, one of the officer's dropped his cap and well brought up child that I was, I picked it up and I gave it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And he looked at me and he said, "You...that child doesn't look too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We saw a little girl next door was a really Juden Cop.” </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And so they left, but my mother was trembling, you know, with rage, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And she yelled after them, "You dogs!" </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And then she said, "Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">What have I done?" </span><span class="sentence" id="164">you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But fortunately, they didn't...they didn't hear her. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And so at that point, she started making inquiries on how to get to the unoccupied zone, and we knew first of all you had to have a guide across because the <span class="DLF">border</span> was heavily guarded between the two <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And you had to have money to pay a guide which we didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And so she tried to sell our household goods, but she was told by the Consiers that there was a law that Jewish people could not sell anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So she couldn't do that, but she managed to somehow, you know, sell her wedding ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And that gave us a little bit of money and then through a <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> that was in operation at the time, she found out the name of a guide in...near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , and made arrangements for us to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So, again, we just...just threw a couple of things in suitcase, left all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , everything behind and set out. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I am not really clear on how we...you know, it's a distance about several hundred miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I think that we rode <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and sometimes we walked, but I am really, you know, sure but we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But, however, we had to be 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondinotso</span> , which near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordo</span> , at a certain date to meet our guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But because things were rather haphazard, you know, in traveling and delays, we got there...we were several days late. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And by the time we got there, the guide had already left on another assignment, and there was no one there to help us across. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And..uh..the ...uh...I guess it was the family of the guide told us, "Well, the only thing you can do 1s try it on your own.” </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And she said, "Wait until about 2 o'clock when the <span class="DLF">border</span> is unguarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Because at that time, the Germans are away having their beers and their having their siesta. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So at that point, you could probably risk getting across.” </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Now we spent sometime in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you know, wondering around and we had gotten there early in the morning and then we waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We tried to lay low. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We went...stopped in a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> and there was some German soldiers there and we pretended to be tourists...French tourists. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And one of them started a conversation with my mother and she kind of you know, laughed it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And...and then we headed for the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And we saw was just barbed wire, and there was no one in sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My mother lifted a piece of barbed wire and crawled across and I guess she threw her suitcases over. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">She had two little cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And I was to follow her. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And in the process, the little dress I was wearing got caught on one of the spikes of the barbed wire and I was impaled on the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And...uh...then my mother realizing what happened, she looked back and she came and she gave my dress a sharp yank and I was...I was freed, and...uh...but then as soon as we got across, you know, it seemed to me that I was hearing voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was probably the wind in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> but everything was so quiet, but I kept hearing voices saying, "You are arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You are arrested.” </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So I was so...you know, wrought my imagine was so wrought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And sure enough, a few feet...we had gone a few feet and we were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And those were the French police which in many cases were much nice than, you know, any...anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They're the local police there and they asked us what we were doing there and why we were there and we..my...you know, my mother just made up a story...uh...but it turned out that they were only looking for smugglers, and contraband, cigarettes, and that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And so they weren't really interested in us, and we didn't look like very threatening types. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And so they let us go and we managed to get onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and finally go across into the free zone, and we joined my father in a...uh...in the __«, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He was...uh...in the...1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Longglad</span> , and he and his other comrades had been put to work doing odd jobs, working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , working on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , working in the <span class="BUILDING">soap factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And... uh...there were people there from all walks of life, all nationalities, and they were called...they were called Prestetiers which was their term for, you know, those type of...those type nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Uh...My father had found a little...an abandoned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for us in the nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kalvison</span> , and so we headed there and found the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was really dilapidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It was something straight out of the middle ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It had a stone hearth, it kept laying down. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It had <span class="INT_SPACE">stone floors</span> , and it, you know, clearly hadn't been lived in for many, many years and the first thing we saw was a scorpion just standing from the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And... uh...when...you know, there was hardly any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was sort of a kind of Charles Adam's type of <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="208">Laughing) And when we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that night, we heard strange noises upstairs and I was terribly frightened and looked like somebody was bowling. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And my father went to investigate and there was all those rats up there rolling things around. (</span><span class="sentence" id="210">Laughing) And then, you know, we figured...uh...and then suddenly, when we started sleeping, we started itching. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And so we looked and we had only candles and we looked and there was all those bed bugs that were in...inside the...the woodwork of the...of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed frame</span> and we spent most of the night killing bed bugs, but we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The only thing is that when it rained there... uh...and we in kind of a low lying area, the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> flooded downstairs and we had to bail out. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But at least, you know, we were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We were in a free zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We weren't hunted anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over our head and that's all that matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And so I resumed the semi-normal activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I was enrolled in a local school system there. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I made a few friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And we were, of course, heavily indoctrinated at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We were made to march on the <span class="DLF">country roads</span> , singing songs to the glory of Marshall Petain. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I remember that they had a contest for Mother's Day in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we were all to do something because at that point, the words...the slogan was motherhood and you know, the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And they were trying to encourage people to have a large family, so motherhood was very big. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And they wanted us kids to...to knit something or crochet, and I was never able to do anything with my hands, so I said that I would write...oh, the heck with it, I'll write a poem for Mother's day. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And it was very corny, but they loved it because the poem got first prize. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I got a letter from Marshall Petain (laughing) which unfortunately I did not keep. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And...uh...then my...my gift, the choice of the prize was I could have a book or I could have a sausage. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And that was big deal, big choice because food was extremely scarce again. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I...I, you know, I debate...I said, "Well, now a sausage. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">After I eat it, it's gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">A book will last forever, so I picked the book.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="232">Laughing) My mother didn't like the poem because it was very sentimental and she said it kind of nauseated her, but they like it so that was the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We started really suffering from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Uh...My father where he was, he got some kind of gruel and, you know, some anemic soup, but where we were there was just nothing to be had, and we lived on mostly ...uh...green peppers and tomatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There were no potatoes and on the one bright event in that part of our lives was that neighbors for our father's birthday gave us three potatoes, and that was a wonderful gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And we figured out all kinds of of ways to...to fix those three potatoes so that they would last longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And the only thing to eat were grapes because that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was abundant in grapes, and I would take part in the grape harvesting and in that way I would get to eat all the grapes I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So during...that season that was something I had to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I remember that because...uh...I was a school child. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I was...by that time, I was 12 years old, and we would get a small ration of milk, a little container of milk for...for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I remember that on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I would stop by the <span class="DLF">fountain</span> , <span class="DLF">village fountain</span> and add water to it to give me the illusion that it was a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But 1t was the first time that we, you know, we really knew what it was to be very hungry, to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> at night hungry, to wake up hungry, and not to have any heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">In the winter, my father had heard, for instance, that there was some railroad trestles to be had so he brought these <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but they were covered with tar so they made a horrible smoke and...and scent with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Uh...But you know, we, you know, we...we still managed to get along, you know, muddled by. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And then came the bad news. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We heard that all of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> is going to be occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So again our last, you know, refuge was about to be gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We...we were once again...we had, you know, we had the Gestapo breathing down our neck, and ...uh...again we thought, "Well, we're going to have to...we're going to have to leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And my father was...uh...told by the commander of his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> that he would have to report somewhere else and possibly be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So at this point he decided to go sort of AWOL. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he put on his pajamas and went upstairs and went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , had a local doctor who was very sympathetic to the plight of Jews, refugees, issue a certificate that he was suffering from a serious heart condition, and he could not leave his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for under any circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So my father did in fact stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and if anybody came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> asking, you know, my mother said, "That my husband 1s very, very ill, you know, and if they want to see for themselves they could.” </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And the doctor who issued was also the Protestant Pastor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and his wife was very active in the various philanthropic...uh...you know, types of organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And they tried to figure out a way for us to get out of here, and the first thing to do was for us to get IDs because if we were going to travel anywhere we needed to have IDs which all the French people had to have anyway but we could not have our real names. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So they managed with the major of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to issue us fake IDs and they changed our name to Sabier, which might sound French name and they changed our birth dates and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they made us citizens of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alvis Lorraine</span> , and they did that because my parents, at least, still had an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And saying that there were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alvis Lorraine</span> , then they would be quite natural because they would speak just like people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And so we...we had that, and then the...uh...the pasteur's wife figured out...she had heard about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children's camp</span> ...uh...somewhere....I think there was...I'm not sure exactly....1t was...maybe in the ___ or somewhere, that I could go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And she thought that perhaps I should be sent there because we didn't know what lay ahead, and she thought maybe I at least I could be saved and so my family thought about it and we talked about it and then in the last minute, they decided not to, because they said, "Wei'll...let's... whatever comes, let's...we want to face together," and I didn't want to be separated and it turned out to be a very wise decision because we found out later on that all the children from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The German...so it was just one of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Now, through the...uh...through the pasteur, again, the grapevine was in work, we found out...he gave us the name of another Protestant Pasteur in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> which was about, oh, 10 miles from the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And the idea was for us to try to find refuge in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , which had retained its neutrality and was still really the only place that we...that we had left to run to. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But again we knew that the <span class="DLF">border</span> was heavily guarded and that the Swiss were not exactly crazy about having that...that many people come, although they wouldn't necessarily turn them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Uh...But it was difficult, and...uh...some people were...had been turned back. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They would...uh...they would let children in, but people under 18 were frequently...if they were caught close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , they were turned back to the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So we knew that was a lot of danger, but we had to risk it. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And so the idea was, again, for us to find someone, a guide, who could lead us across to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And we were given the name of a Protestant Pasteur that we would see in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> , and he would kind of ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So, again, we just left in a great hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We left all our belongings with the neighbors and saying that, "Okay, when we know where we are, you can send it to us," and we never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Uh...So we...basically, we just had the clothes on our back. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Very little money, and our fake IDs. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And that's how we set out. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">When we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> , we looked up the pasteur. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The pasteur had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He'd gotten scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That there had too many...you know, he had been turned in, and he just got frightened and he said, "Sorry, there is just nothing we can do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And they gave us the name of a very rich Jewish family that happened to live in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they said maybe they can do something for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So we went over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And they said, "Well, how much money do you have.” </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We said, "We don't.” </span><span class="sentence" id="281">He said, "You know we have to have money to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And we didn't have any money and I'm...you know, I'm sorry that fellow Jews didn't come off too well at that point, but...uh...the only thing they told us was to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and see if they could help us, and gave us a name of a certain priest who had been active in helping Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> of the Notre Dame in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> , and we asked for the...the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But he had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So his housekeeper said, "Okay, well, we can give you the name of these people in the bordertown of, you know, it was just a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And they had a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and you go see them and...uh...they could find you a guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh...So, again, we...we set out and we reached the <span class="BUILDING">bordertown</span> and we got there with...early in the morning, and they said, "Well, you know, it's much too dangerous to try to attempt to do anything right now, and so this 1s what you do and they pointed to a fairly high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> just behind the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and they gave us a couple...some provisions and they said, "You climb up that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and you stay there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And you know, "under cover until night fall and at night fall, my husband will come and look for you and he will whistle twice and when you hear the whistle, you answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">You come out hiding and you identify yourselves and he will lead you down and he will lead you to your guide.” </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So we went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We went...climbed on top and it was a very, very arduous climb and we weren't in the best of shape to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And we finally got up there and we kind of sank down on the bare pine needles and waited and...uh...it was October and as, you know, in <span class="REGION">mountain country</span> it gets cold very early in the season and it started getting cold, and we didn't really have anything to cover ourselves with, but we figured, "Well, the guide is supposed to come any minute now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And then it got darker and then suddenly we saw some lights go on, and there were...there was a whole mass of them down in the valley, and we figured it must be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We were looking right at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountaintop</span> , looking down on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> called Mountain of the Salav, and we felt at that point, really felt like the...you know, Israelites looking at the Promised Land. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was so near. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You know, we could almost touch it and yet 1t was so far and we wondered if we would be denied like Moses, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Say okay, you can look at it, but you can't go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And then it got really dark, and my father finally said, "Look, I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">There must have been something with the guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Either we missed him or he didn't see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We didn't hear him or something went wrong, but we can't stay because if we stay on this <span class="DLF">mountaintop</span> , we're going to die of exposure or starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So we decide to climb down and try to find a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , anything, just to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And...but it was pitch black, and we really didn't have any idea where we're going so we decided to go Indian file, and just holding hands and marking and I remember the...it was like, you know, three people traveling in a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We were banging into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We were stumbling on rocks on the way, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We were falling and it was just...and we had no idea what directions we were going or whether we ever go down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We were just sort of following instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And then after awhile, we had gone for what seemed hours, we saw light in the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So we went toward the light and almost like by miracle, we wound up at the same <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> where we had started out the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And it was just providence, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And we knocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It was late. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And we knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and the farm wife came and she said, "What happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="318">She was just aghast. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">She said, "My husband went to look for you and he whistled and you didn't answer, so he thought that something happened and so he left.” </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we said, "We never...we must have got our signals crossed, but we never heard him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And she said, "Unfortunately, the guide who was supposed to take you across has left. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">You missed the connection because you were supposed to leave, you know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So she said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Can't do anything now," so she pointed to a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> and she said, "There's some straw there," and she gave us a glass of milk and some bread and she said, "Go there in the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> where you be safe and...uh...1n the morning we'll figure out what to do with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And so very, very early morning...and she said, "You know, you've got to get out of here in a hurry because some guy has already come by, you know, and asking questions, and she said, "you've got to get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="326">She says, "I made up a story.” </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And so she said, "Look, I'm going to send you"...she named the name of the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> ...she said, "I lived...and you will look for a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> there, and you go in and you tell the baker who sent you and he will lead you out his <span class="DLF">back door</span> which is in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You know, the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">You go out the <span class="DLF">back door</span> and you're in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and you'll be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Iaughing) And we thought, "Well, that sounds...that sounds good to us." </span><span class="sentence" id="331">you know. (</span><span class="sentence" id="332">laughing) So we...we set out for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we went around and we couldn't find the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And...uh...as in any small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , three strangers with a suitcase wondering around are very conspicuous and we knew that, you know, at any moment, we'd be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And my father said, "Why don't you go," because we were right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> and my father sent me and said, "Go look. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Go check it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">You know, you're a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">You know you won't be so noticed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So I went ahead and I saw the barbed wire and I saw the guards standing there and it was heavily guarded and I came back and I said, "No way," you know, "We're not going to make it.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And next thing you know, a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limousine</span> pulled up and a guy...guy got out and headed straight for the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and then the next thing was two policemen came out and arrested us and took us to the <span class="BUILDING">station house</span> , you know, because the apparently was a person who was, you know, a snitcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The French have a cute name for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They call it a Mooshab, but it's somebody who tells on people. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And so again, the questioning started. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They wanted to know what we're doing, and my father again made up a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">He said that they were going to put me in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for children in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and that the priest had sent us, you know, but they didn't...just didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And then they took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They frisked us. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">They took my...a matron took my mother and me in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and told us to strip and...uh...and...uh... the matron said to me, "Aren't you afraid?" </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I said, "No.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="349">laughing) And then...and then...uh...they asked to see our IDs, so my father produced our fake IDs and they said, "Who do you think you're kidding. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Anybody looking at them can tell these are fake. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I mean, look at that stamp there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And my father, "Oh No. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I assure you.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="355">Oh, come on," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And he said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Tell you what I'm going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I am going to call the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where those IDs were made out. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We'll see who's telling the truth.” </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So by that time, my father started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">We were all crying and we said okay, this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So we sat there and waited and the guy was gone for a very long time and he came back and he said, "Well, you pulled it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">The mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> has confirmed your identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">You are free to go.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we never knew whether he had just pretended to phone, to give the appearance of...in front of the others of doing his duty or whether in fact the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had, you know, sensed what was up and said, "Yal, Sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="367">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">All we knew was that he said we're free to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And we just couldn't believe that, and their whole demeanor changed because actually, they didn't want to hurt, you know, people like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They, you know, they had orders but by and large, our experience with the French police had always been extremely good. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They did not like what was going on anymore than anyone else and they would try to help whenever they could within the limits that they were entitled. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And so they turned to be very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They gave my father some cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They gave me a bar of chocolate, and...uh...they said, "Okay, you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But please don't try this again. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Don't because if you do, we're going to have to turn you over to the authorities this time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And so we figured, "Okay, but where are we going to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="379">You know, you hit the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Where...where are you going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We had only what we were wearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And there was no other safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to go to, and so the only thing that we could figure out to do was to go back of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> , go back to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , and see if they could do anything for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And so we started out on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and then suddenly we heard somebody calling our name and there was a woman on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> pedaling furiously and she says, "Are you the people who just left the <span class="BUILDING">station house</span> a few minutes ago.” </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And we thought, "Oh, my gosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Now what?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="388">Yal.” </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And she says, "Well, I'm the wife of one of the officers there and he was worried about you, and he thought maybe you should come back with us and have dinner because you looked so starved and everything you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Maybe you should give yourself a chance.” </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But we just...we just didn't...even though she seemed perfectly nice, we just didn't trust her. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And we said, "No, we really have to be going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And so she gave us a loaf of bread that she happened to have with her, and wished us good speed and we went on our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And we found out that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> leaving for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> that day and so while we waited on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> we saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with sealed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> go by. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And one of the people who happened to be standing there said that these had contained the people who had been caught on the <span class="DLF">border</span> and were on their way to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And we thought, you know, we could have been, you know, it was so close. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We could have been on one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We finally made it back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and the priest, that same priest whose name we had gotten earlier still wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we said, "Well, you know, what are we going to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And she said...the person who was the housekeeper there said, "Well, we having a visiting priest here, Father Lashora, and he's here to fix the...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">clock tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Maybe you could...uh...you could talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And so we sought him out, and my mother and I first, and we spill our story and he apparently felt sorry for us and he said, "Look, I have a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">parish</span> about 10 kilometers from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It's a little mountain parish, and maybe you can come and stay with me until I can figure out what to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And he asked my mother if she could cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And she said, "Oh yes, I can cook and clean.” </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And he said, "Fine, and you can help out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And my mother said, "What about my husband?" </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He said, "Oh, you've got a husband?" </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He seemed a little disappointed, but "Okay, let him come too. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Let the husband come too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So he told us how to get there and...uh...we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then we had to walk up. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It was pretty steep. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It was...uh...700 meters, so 1t was quite a good climb, and so we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> and it...on the <span class="DLF">mountaintop</span> , there was only the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And then all around there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where the people from the community went and came to Mass and attended as children attended <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But there was just those three <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> on the <span class="DLF">mountaintop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So we found the...the <span class="BUILDING">Parish house</span> and the priest gave us one of his <span class="INT_SPACE">guest room</span> and he said, "Well, we'll try to, you know, to figure out something. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Just rest for the timebeing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And...uh...he told us, of course, "Stay put. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">You know, don't go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and don't even open the curtains because people are going to come up to Mass, and we don't want anybody seeing you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So we just stayed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> all day long and met his housekeeper who was not very well disposed toward us. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She was a rabid...uh...she wasn't exactly anti-Semitic, but she just loved Marshall Petain, and she just ...uh...and she just didn't like to have three strangers suddenly descending on her and she was worrying about all the extra work that was going to be and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And, as a matter of fact, she was so angry that she just refused to work, and so my mother took over. (</span><span class="sentence" id="425">Laughing) And there was also a law there: a priest cannot keep people as guests longer than 3 days without informing his bishop. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">You know, that was a church rule no matter who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So after awhile, he said, "Look, you know, I'm having a problem now. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We're going to have to figure out...uh...what to do and...at that point my father said, "Look, you've been so nice to us and we really appreciate it, but we really think we ought to be going again and try to get back and cross into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And he wouldn't hear of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">He said, "I have made inquiries and it's much too dangerous and I...I won't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I won't expose you to that kind of danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">What I have to do 1s find you a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Now to do this, he had to take some of the village people into his confidence because, obviously, half these people saw me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And...uh...so they...some of them were told we were Jewish, but not that we were Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He told we were French from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alce Lorraine</span> , and we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And those people had never seen Jews before in their entire lives, and later on I was told that they wondered what these people looked like and the only thing they had been told was that the Jews had killed Jesus Christ, and then later some little classmates that I had made friends, they told me that they had wondered what those Jews looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And he said, "You know, looked just like the rest of us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You know, very, very surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And...uh...but you know, so he had to tell some of the village people that he also told them, Please, you know, don't tell anybody because this is very dangerous for me and for everybody else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="440">In...in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French village</span> , a priest has a lot of authority and people being very devout, I think he used a little bit of pressure and he told them, you know, threatened them will hell fire and damnation if they would denounce us. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And so they figured well, they didn't want to take that chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">He was also well liked and respected so they didn't want to cause trouble for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So a handful of people knew of our existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And as their...the local grade school teacher, who was...he was a young guy and his wife, who ran it from a one-room <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> there, and he...himself was on the lam, so to speak, because all the young men up to a certain age was supposed to go and do forced labor in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And so those that didn't went underground and they were the start of the resistance movement, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And so himself, you know, was in danger and he was most helpful with issuing us ration cards and just identity cards and enrolling me in the school system.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  This is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Let's pause and we're going to change tapes and give you a moment to rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Do you want to...to continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">With the help of the...uh...villagers and priest, found a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">valley</span> and so we...uh, you know, settled in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Uh...then the priest made me an offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">He had an herd of sheep which he kept to supplement his meager income as a country priest, and he would sell the wool of the sheep and occasionally the meat of the sheep and he also did odd jobs for the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We pay a job and that's why he was there that day fixing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And so he said, "Look, I have a little shepherd boy, who has just left. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">How would you like to keep my herd of sheep in exchange for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board.” </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He said, "This way, you wouldn't be cramped, all of you in the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and you would have better nourishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">You would be out in the fresh air.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And so it sounded like a really good idea to me and so I moved up to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">parish</span> and had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there and I would just take out the sheep to the <span class="DLF">pasture</span> every morning and bring them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night when I wasn't in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> usually some nights when you go take the sheeps out and I kind of enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">By that time I hardly had any clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">The clothes I had were in rags and any people who happened to venture up there, they took me for shepherdess, nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Couldn't possibly be anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And then I was...he turned over to me other chores like helping kids with the catechism, make them recite the catechism, and I would go and I was a little heathen. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I was not really given any training in the Jewish faith because my parents were agnostic. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I mean they just...they didn't believe in anything and this is a fact that later on I came to regret because I had a sense of...you know a loss of identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I didn't know who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">All my little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> mates were one thing or another, and I just didn't know where I fitted in. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I had a...a spiritual hunger that somehow was never satisfied and if I had been given some training, it would have helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So I started out really with a clean slate and I was very much impressed by the Mass, because it was very theatrical and very beautiful and I just really went along with it and I learned all the hymens and I was singing...I learned the entire Mass in Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I taught catechism, but I never...I never became a Catholic at the point and what is really laudable is that the priest himself never made any effort to convert us. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Never! </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It never even came up because he felt it wouldn't be the right thing anyway you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It just...1t wouldn't be right. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">What he was doing was he felt it was his Christian duty, but with any thought of, you know, recompense or anything, he was just doing what he had to do which so many other people in that period did. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And I had all the little duties. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They gave...they put me in charge of ringing the church bells and going to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> nearby, watering <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I enjoyed that life. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It was the life on the <span class="DLF">pasture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It was close to nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">It was you know, as commonplace, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I developed a deep love for..for nature, and never really...uh...felt good about living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> ever since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Uh...So I had my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">room board</span> and the priest shared everything he had with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">All the food, and so I wasn't too badly off, and he had a...he had some fruit trees and he had food and he had a <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span> and later on, he turned over to us little plot of ground where we could cultivate our own vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And my parents were still downstairs...no...1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but then some trouble developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Uh...There was a <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> next door and where people brought grain to be ground and the grain was then made into oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And somebody had broken in during the night and stolen the oil and so next thing we knew, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was crawling with police again. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And, you know, the __ got really edgy and the...you know, they questioned us and we just got off, but it was...1t was touchy for us, for my parents to stay there after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And so when the priest heard what had happened, that things had deteriorated, he decided that they had to...they had to leave and he tried to find them another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay and he just...there was just nothing there...pretty sparsely populated and there was... So he decided...finally, he made them a proposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">He was a little bit embarrassed but he said, "Look, I have an unused <span class="INT_SPACE">bar room</span> at the bottom of my...on the <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">sub basement</span> , and if you could be content with that, I would give it to you and you could be safe there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And my parents said, "Sure," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So they showed them <span class="INT_SPACE">bar room</span> and he gave them a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron bed stand</span> , and he put in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood stove</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and that was about it, but it was extremely small. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They had no <span class="DLF">windows</span> and just one <span class="DLF">door</span> leading out to the...to the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> surrounding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And basically, for the next 3 years until the end of the war...uh...my parents stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">boiler room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Never left, except on very rare occasions to go to the nearby <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because...uh...the only way they could cook and heat the little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was to put some wood in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> so that the...the priest showed them how to go and cut down <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> so my father would go on a regular basis and just saw down <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and chop them up for wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And then the priest also taught my father how to look for edible mushrooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And it really was a good supplement to a diet because they were high in protein and there wasn't much else around to eat, so that was one of the main staples in those days and occasionally he would slaughter a sheep and then we would have...he would share some meat with us and he did give us a little plot of ground so eventually I planted a little <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span> and we had some fresh vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Uh...I as a child could go out because you know, I wouldn't be noticed so I occasionally went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> to buy a few staples that were rare, able to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And... uh...my mother occasionally went down when it was safe and in exchange for say a dozen eggs, she would do some sewing for the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and make some hats, you know, or assist them. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But that was only very rarely, because most of the time it just wasn't safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The other thing was that we didn't have any shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">My mother had risked somehow kept...I don't how she did it, but she had kept a pair of old ski boots from the good days in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And my shoes wore out, so I wound up wearing hers but then if I was wearing shoes, she couldn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So we kind of took turns doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And so I would say that although they did go out occasionally, most of the time they were confined...they were confined to this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where I...and I attended...I attended the <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And I was...I was 12 years old at the time, 13...going on 13, and I was supposed to take a test, a national test which signals really the end of <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> for most farm kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">After that point, they just stop and... However, even though I did all the preparatory work for the test, the teacher felt that it would be too risky for me to actually go because you had to go to the...uh...you know, nearby big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and you had to fill out forms and you had...uh...you know prove who you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">You had to have birth certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And so he decided no, I wasn't going to take the test. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">But he...he couldn't tell the other kids why, and so they thought that I couldn't take the test because I was too dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And at that age, it hurts you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They were making fun of me and started calling me names. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And then some of them started acting really nasty and called me dirty Jews and one little boy beat me up and then I...when I told the priest about it, he put a stop to that, you know, and there wasn't too much problem...uh...after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Uh... There was another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">The...uh...the priest had a nephew, his sister's son...uh... son who was in the French Miless, and that was a paramilitary organization, which in many instances was worse than the Gestapo in their cruelty. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They were just totally ruthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Now the nephew, who lived in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , occasionally came to visit his uncle and there was no way that he could keep his presence from the nephew and somehow you know he found out about it, and when he did he immediately threatened...he renounced his uncle and us to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And....uh...the priest said, "Okay, now if you do this, I will denounce you to the resistance which by that time was coming into its own and was getting quite strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Right across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , we could look at the famous <span class="DLF">plateau</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Glerair</span> , where whole bunch, you know, resistance fighters were killed, and they were all around us in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They would come down at night and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> would feed them so they were a very real presence. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And then later on there was scrimmages. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">You know, they would put <span class="DLF">road blocks</span> , prevent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> from going by and they were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So the threat of turning him over to the resistance was real enough that he held off from doing anything, but he vowed that, you know, he would come back and have his day. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So we...after...after that, the priest and us too, you know, we...we lived in constant fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Uh...and then, you know, the Gestapo...we, I mean the German troops were all over Annecy and every time I went there I...I had to...a couple old friends I made there, and every time I went down there, I...you know, I could see them and I really felt uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I just couldn't, you know, get away fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And we had very little news from the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The only thing was that the...uh...the housekeeper had a...a radio in her <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we listened to the BBC so we ....uh...and sometimes to ...uh...the newscast from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> so we did get some news. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">My father...my father, having been a journalist, was especially deprived, you know, not being able to have access to any kind of a news. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And we started hearing about the advance of the Russians and we had a map and we put pins there and so we knew that our deliverance was...was getting close. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I mean we knew that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And I think the one thing I remember from that period was that they had a code word for the landing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , and it was...uh...a friend will come tonight, and that one just absolutely stuck in my memory and the other one was Aunt Julie ate chicken for lunch twice, you know, and just...I think as long as I live I'll remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And so, you know, we were...we had a fearing that we would be rescued, but then things started getting really bad again. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">You know, there were maydays and they would loose some <span class="REGION">territory</span> and my father became very, very pessimistic, and he started talking about our future, always in the conditional...1f we survive, and he started telling me now, if you should be separated from your mother and father, I want you to try to contact this person and that person and he just...you know, he hadn't totally given up hope but he...he was getting depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And...uh...there were, you know, there were more incidents of run-ins with the...uh...with the Gestapo and the resistance movement which, for us, it was dangerous because they were always...they were always crawling around so that we had a...a kind of prearranged signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Whenever there was some...uh...German troops nearby, somebody would give the alert and then the young teacher who was also in danger, and my parents would climb up to the <span class="BUILDING">clock tower</span> and there was a bunch of hay there and they would just hide in the hay until the 'all clear' was sounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And...uh...the priest had also by that time taken in another young man who was trying to get away from forced labor in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">He was that age, so he was not only hiding my parents, but he was hiding this young man who was not Jewish, but he just didn't wanta go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Uh...Finally...uh...one time, we...we were...bunch of us, with the teacher and I, were sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> coming up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and all these men in the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And we thought, "Oh, this is it," you know. "</span><span class="sentence" id="543">This is it!" </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And we started... gave the alert and we all ran back into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I alerted my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They barred a <span class="DLF">door</span> and....uh...late...and then we...I just went and stayed with my parents downstairs and we...we...we were sure it was the Gestapo coming up and the German troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And then later, we heard them leave and then the next thing we knew, the housekeeper knocked on our <span class="DLF">door</span> and she was in tears and she said, "No, it's not the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">It's...uh...the priest's nephew and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They were caught by the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">They had torched their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and his wife and baby had been forced to flee so he had just come, dropped his family off at the priest, and left and later on, he was shot by the Resistance.” </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So here were all these...all these people...uh...being with us, but ...uh...you know, when she first knocked on our <span class="DLF">door</span> and she said, "Don't be afraid.” </span><span class="sentence" id="551">For some reason, I... was more afraid than I have been so. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But at least, you know, it wasn't...1t wasn't what we thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And...uh...then...uh... we started seeing RAS, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">RAS planes</span> going overhead and we knew they were on their bomb Curran. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So we knew that, you know, something had to happen soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And then one morning, that young man who the priest had also taken in, pounded on my <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, "Eva, they have landed. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They have landed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And I, you know, this must have been the happiest day of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And, of course, that was only...that was only the beginning, and it took quite awhile before all of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was liberated and...uh...the part where we were in and but finally...finally came to that at the point where we, you know, where we knew it was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Unfortunately, by then the news...we had been able to communicate with some of our friends, with relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We...we didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I had a...uh...my father had a sister and...uh...her sister had a daughter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we had...we didn't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We didn't find out til several years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">But we got the news that my grandmother, my father's mother who was in her 70s, had been taken away in the middle of the night and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> where she succumbed shortly thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And my grandfather, whom they had not taken at that point with all the, you know, excitement, everything, had a stroke and...uh...he remained at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as I was told later for several weeks and he was totally out of his mind and, you know, and he never really regained full consciousness and wind up dying too. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So later on, my cousin submitted both their names to the Yad Vashem where they are on that roll with the rest of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So that was a terrible blow for my father, and I remember he went out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and just wanted to be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He just didn't want to talk to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And I know that later on, I had really, you know, guilt feelings about that, about surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Cause I loved my grandmother and I said, "Oh why...why was I...why was I left to live and...and not her," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And I really felt guilty about being alive, and it took me years...years to identify that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I didn't have it in concrete form. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I just knew I felt guilty and then I finally, you know, came to terms with it, but it took many years before I actually came to terms with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So basically, we were free to go, but the priest had gotten attached to us and he wouldn't let us go. (</span><span class="sentence" id="574">Laughing) And he said, "Look, where are you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="575">You don't have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go to? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">What... You don't have any money? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">You don't have a job? </span><span class="sentence" id="578">What are you going to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So he talked my father into staying a little while longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And he sent me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> and I attended the Letsa for...for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And then finally my father, you know, he was getting restless and he went ahead to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to see what he could do and he did find some kind of work there and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to stay, a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And so we did rejoin him and it was a very, you know, it was hard to part with the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And but at that point, you know, he promised...he made us promise that we would come back to at least to see him on a vacation and we did, and...and we kept that promise, but I also had made a vow to myself and that was to tell the world what he had done for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I vowed that some day the whole world would know, and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It take many years, but it came to pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But finally my father said he had found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, so we came...we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we joined him and things were almost worse than they had been...uh...at the...at the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">There was absolutely no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And we depended on care rations from people in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and clothes that the people who had succeeded in going overhead was sending us. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">There was no heat, you know, and I became very ill because of all the...uh...being undernourished and had and pleurisy and I was ill for 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And then my parents gave me a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They said, "Look, you still...our life is just half over, but you have your...I was barely 16 at the time, and you still have your whole life in front of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So you decide. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Do you want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or do you want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And, of course, I didn't have to think about it very long. "</span><span class="sentence" id="595">I want to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Because I heard wonderful <span class="DLF">streets</span> and, you know, the <span class="DLF">streets</span> are paved with gold and everything which was just, you know, I had by that time seen some Hollywood movies and so naturally I... was no question in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">They put our name on the quota in 1946, and it took 2 years for our names to get to the head of the quota and but by the time they called us, we just had to leave....period...you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Two days and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">We...you had to have a sponsor, somebody over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> guaranteeing that you would not become a welfare case and affidavits and...and we had...my mother had a brother who station who gave the affidavit in...in...so that was...so we...we came over by...by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Nine day trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Landed in New York Harbor in May of 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  Eva, where did you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">What was your adjustment to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Where were you taken first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Well, it was bad because we were taken to a_____ shelter first, although my uncle couldn't have put us, he put us in a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , and then his wife, fearful that we might cost too much money, put my mother and me to work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So this was our introduction to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Was not too pleasant and...uh...we didn't stay there very long. (</span><span class="sentence" id="608">Laughing) My mother's health started breaking down almost as soon as we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">She developed high blood pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">She had a series of strokes, and so really from that time on she was almost an invalid, very, you know, almost not able to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We..the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> we could find was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">tenement</span> on the <span class="REGION">upper east side</span> , you know, <span class="REGION">east side</span> bordering on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harlem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And...uh...my father had trouble finding work. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Of course, I didn't speak English so I had to start all over again learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I was 18 at the time, so I did..I did learn it, and...uh...1mmediately it was... really I had to go to work to...to support the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But I had no skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You know, I had no work experience, and I had to do a bit of fudging. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I looked to the want ads, and I saw somebody wanting a bookkeeper and I had never done bookkeeping, but I figured, "Okay, well.” </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Anyway, it happened to be a publishing company and I guess I convinced him to hire me and they soon found out that I really didn't know anything about bookkeeping, but they felt sorry for me, I guess, and they kept me and I stayed there for 5 years, and sorting mail and doing really menial jobs, but 1t was a beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And...uh...37 dollars a week. (</span><span class="sentence" id="620">Laughing) And from then I worked my way steadily worked my way up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Uh..But my father finally did find...uh... some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">He did some writing articles again for French newspapers, and he sold a few stories and eventually he had his own advertising agency and then he and a partner wrote a series of books for pocketbooks and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But my mother, basically, you know, was too ill to...uh...to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So the...] became... became a New Yorker. (</span><span class="sentence" id="625">Laughing)
QUESTION:  Eva, when did you get married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  [...1 got married in 1959 and my husband had grown up in the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> so really was a totally divergent culture like opposite ends of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">His father was an army officer in the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and...uh...got married in 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  I want to thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Uh...I appreciate your being here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">ANSWER:  I am very pleased to tell my story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Is there anything you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  There is one thing, a kind of a happy footnote that I had vowed to...uh...you know, tell the world about the priest that saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And then I found out only 3 years old that the Yad Vashem in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> actually solicited testimonies from survivors, like me, about their rescuers and I was put in touch with some friends that I feel had kept in touch with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> and I went through all the channels, submitting testimony and sent it off there and took it 18 months before I had a reply and they finally...uh...did inform me by letter that our priest had been accorded the honor of just among the nations that he would a have a tree planted in his name in the Garden of the Just at the Yad Vashem, and that he would be awarded a medal of the Just. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And then the people who knew him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> and others...and some of the members of the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annecy</span> organized a commemorative ceremony which they're having from time to time recognize people who had been honored by the Yad Vashem, and so they had a ceremony on May 6th and for...for Father Lashora who was our priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Father Lashora died in 1959, as a matter of fact, so this was all post humorously, and it was for him and for other priests who had been recognized only one of whom was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And they had 400...400 people present there. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They had representatives from the...from the Yad Vashem, the Minister of Israel, representatives from the local Archbishop and the Minister of Annecy, and the mayor, and it was a truly ecumenical kind of gathering. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And then we...the current priest of that parish now accepted the medal in the name of the priest and the medal...on the front of the front of the medal it says to Father Lashora, from the grateful Jewish people, and on the back it says, "He who saves a life saves all of humanity.” </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And then we...we decided that we put the medal in a glass case and put it in his old <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> to be preserved forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And I was invited to give...you know to just briefly tell the story as the Father priest was involved in our rescue, and with that I felt that I had finally given him the proper recognition that he deserved.</span></p>
