<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Baden</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Uh June 7th, 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  My father owned a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Baden</span> , and he and my mother had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I have one sister who lives here in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and my older sister passed away a few years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majorca</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We had a good youth, a very nice up-bringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I went to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I, after that I entered the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> for nine years and received baccalaureate. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">By that time, the political situa...the political situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wasn't too rosy and there was a lot of unemployment. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I was supposed to enter a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in the province as an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But when I was ready, they were not in a position to accept me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Because the uh Nazis, while not in power yet, had quite some influence and everybody was afraid to accept a Jewish apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">As far as my Jewish upbringing, there was none. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My parents were quite assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And Jewish religion, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We just... nothing there was said. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I became more aware of my religion only through the Nazi revo...uh Nazi... Not revolution. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I mean, when they came into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In 1932, after matriculation, I left my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We had had an exchange program with a family in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyon</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake of Geneva</span> , and there were still about six weeks that they owed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So I spent six weeks there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And after that, through some friends and through a <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the League of Nations, I got a job on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , on a...behind the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vevey</span> , on Lake...on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake of Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was tough times there. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">If I had had the money to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after I had arrived there, I would probably have turned around and gone back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Instead of that, I had to get up about five o'clock in the morning to start cleaning the <span class="DLF">pig's sty</span> and then the cows and then the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And everybody spoke French and I didn't know that much French when I got there, but I quickly had to learn whether I liked it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I stayed there for about two months and then the farmer sent me with a...with one man and about twenty cows up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> where he had meadows and I stayed there for another two months 'til the beginning of September of '32. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Yeah, 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">By that time, uh my father had been able to get me an apprenticeship in a <span class="BUILDING">mechanical factory</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> which was owned by friends of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I went through a two year apprenticeship, commercial apprenticeship, the end of which I had to go through an examination for commercial assistance by the Chamber of Commerce. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Fortunately, during that time, the after (ph) the Nazis were in command in 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But that examination took place during the time these people were not allowed to wear their uniforms due to the Rohm affair, when Hitler had his... one of his assistants killed and I passed, therefore I could pass that examination and I stayed for another year or so as an employee in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Then in December 1935, I was informed that due to my status as a Jew they were not able to keep me. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I had to leave by the end of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I went skiing the beginning of December, and hurt my hand; so I left three weeks early. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and tried to find some work there which was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Even a friend of my father's who owned his own <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> was not allowed to employ me even without pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Tell me what else it was like in 1935, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , for a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Well, you couldn't go any <span class="NPIP">place</span> but to Jewish organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There were lots of young people who had not given up hope that things would change in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we went out together. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We had meetings together, and one of the things I recall is that on Mardi Gras of 1936, at a time when I already knew I was going to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , I went out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with some friends and the public was all heppped up and they were all in good humor and playing around and they were stopping <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> and uh trying to lift them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">There was nothing bad involved â€˜till suddenly a contingent of SS men came from the side <span class="DLF">streets</span> with their swords out and just started hitting indiscriminately anybody who was in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I got a cut in my winter coat at that time because I wasn't running fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Otherwise I did not spend much time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Before that, in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hornburg</span> (ph) in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> where I spent my working time in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where I was employed, things were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">During the winter when the only the people of that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were there, I didn't have much trouble, but this was a place that had many guests came up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> in the summer for vacations and so and I learned soon to keep by myself because on two occasions I was once thrown out of a <span class="BUILDING">coffee shop</span> where I was sitting with people from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and once was just beaten uh up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> which cost me fortunately only my glasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I even was asked to apply to come, to enter the German Armed Forces because I was in the age group that was called up and the uh mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hornburg</span> insisted that I go through the formalities because he thought I was such a good man that they needed me, but they after they had I had a physical examination and they got the uh information about my parents and ancestors I got the information that they could very well do without me. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Then, to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , I had applied to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> as a student in archeology since I had had uh my background with the <span class="BUILDING">Humanistic Gymnasium</span> , knew the ancient languages and 1n addition to this my older sister had gone, had had the opportunity to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> even earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">After about two and a half months of efforts and a number of very uh uneasy meetings with officials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , I indeed got a visa, got a passport to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I found out afterwards that at the same time I left, the Greek police for foreigners was informed that this guy is not really a student - he is a Jewish refugee and due to this information I had quite a bit of difficulty staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But I arrived there in 19.., in February, end of February of '36. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Was met by my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">After a nice journey, and I was quite elated to have left the Third Reich, my sister had made some friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">She was mainly giving language lessons there, and after some weeks, I got various jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I had brought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> with me and a pair of skis. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The pair of skis was to show that I was a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I was not apt to forget my favorite sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And, believe it or not, I did go skiing in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> --in the Peloponnese--which was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I got various jobs in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and the mentality there of the people who employed me was such that they would trust me more than any of their other employees which was to my advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">technical office</span> where we imported all kinds of electrical equipment from the rest of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They considered very small as outside of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I think at that time I worked for them for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Then in, after working for him which was actually part-time, I went in the late afternoon to a <span class="BUILDING">newspaper distributing office</span> to - whom I had been recommended to and uh the way I, my first impression of that job was quite interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The uh owner of the (ph), which means (ph) newspaper agency, took me to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the foreign newspaper department and there behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> uh was a young man with not one but uh three signs that he was a member of the Nazi party and he talked to me in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He never knew that I was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He was, and he handed the department over to me because he had been called back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He was already gone the next day and the boss and I were left with quite a mess because there were quite a number of subscriptions to German Nazi papers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> for Germans who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , and when I started sending somebody around to collect subscription monies that according to the books they owned us, they had all been paid and the predecessor of mine evidentially had pocketed the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I started the work in that department with quite a uh debt, and the only way after, during the two and one-half years I worked there we could eradicate that debt was by ordering lots of newspapers from the various <span class="REGION">provinces</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , five copies from this one, five copies from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Naturally nobody would buy that stuff even, so we would distribute it to the various <span class="BUILDING">kiosks</span> and when we got it back you cut the top off, send it back so that you didn't have to pay for it, and the rest of the paper was sold as uh, and we uh wegot credit for it and eventually we wiped out that debt which amounted in quite, to quite a - I think it was over 100,000 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  How did you come to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  To <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  To <span class="COUNTRY">Crete</span> , you were...
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">In <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That was all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Yes, alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">What happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  My parents came - we brought my parents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> one year after I came and we uh, my father had some representation from a <span class="BUILDING">chemical factory</span> who thought they could sell their pills in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> but after, by the end of 1938 the Greek government wouldn't allow us anymore to renew our permit of residence in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They informed us that they knew from the German uh authorities that they would be very happy to welcome us back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We were not anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The four of us, my parents, my sister and I, we went from one <span class="BUILDING">foreign consulate</span> to the other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> to try and get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to uh go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And this was quite difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We once thought we had a, we thought to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> but when we went to buy steamship tickets, we found out that that consul was only an honorary consul, and wasn't supposed to give visas out and after some difficulty we got half our money back. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Then thanks to my father's connection with the Free Masons - it's a masonic order in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> - we found a man in the <span class="BUILDING">British Embassy</span> who helped to get us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">His connection through the CID caused them to check our family tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And they found--which we knew, which was correct--that my mother was related to Walter Rathenau, who had been the foreign secretary of the Weimar Republic after the First World War and who also was about the first victim of Nazi murder in 1923 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They told us we could proceed any <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the British Empire we wanted to go to, provided we had the means to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Closest <span class="NPIP">place</span> was the island of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> ; but <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> required for anyone who came there one thousand pounds to show in cash. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We didn't have that kind of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So the British Ambassador in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> caused them to reduce this amount to a thousand pounds for the whole family--for the four of us--which was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The only drawback was we didn't have the thousand pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I managed to go to the two main employers I had, and I borrowed from each one five hundred pounds in Greek money. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So we put that on an account in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , and we were...we managed to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Half a year later, I could send them the money back. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But that was uh a break we got, because without this help from the British Ambassador I don't know what would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> in the beginning of March of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And in uh...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limassol</span> , my father promptly got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We were stuck there in a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">After that we moved to the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicosia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I got a job in an <span class="BUILDING">import office</span> , and my sister got a job in another...1n a <span class="BUILDING">technical office</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But in September of '39, when <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> entered the war, I came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I found a note in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> : "Do not come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Because business was dead; and besides, that he told me after he was not to employee enemy aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I then got work in a small <span class="BUILDING">sausage factory</span> which had been bought by a couple of Austrian Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They needed somebody who spoke Greek and English, because neither of one did...uh of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And for some weeks, I sold sausage-- much to the embarrassment of my parents, who would never come to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> but who liked to eat the sausage I brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">After that, thanks to the Commissioner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicosia</span> , the British Commissioner, I got a job in the <span class="DLF">asbestos mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They didn't know anything about asbestos was dangerous, and thank God it didn't do any harm to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But uh I went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I worked in the bookkeeping department for, I think, it's only about a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And eventually the uh director of the mine put a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at my disposal, and my parents and my sister could come up there to stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Because in the meantime, things had gotten worse politically. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And uh when the Germans overrun <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> I think every refugee and every person who had arrived in...on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> with German papers was interned. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They opened an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> right next to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , for the men only. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Women they left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And in that camp were mostly Jews--maybe about twenty real Germans who were kept strictly to themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Was not a very good time, because that we were staying 1n <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was uh... whenever a wind came up there was a lot of dirt in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and we had to work out what we were going to eat every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I was more or less in charge of that, again because I knew the languages and somewhere .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  They did not feed you? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You had to...
ANSWER:  No, well they told us what... "Here's what you get every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You make your own menu." </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I still have somewhere menus or a menu. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I don't have it with me, but if I find it I'll make a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So that kept me busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Besides that, they gave us a couple of packets of cigarettes every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And due to the fact that my father was a heavy smoker, I stopped smoking at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">He got my cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Uh after about a month in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> , the authorities realized that that was not a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to leave us because people got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And they moved the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> up in the mountains of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> called [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berengaria</span> (ph)]|. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And it was naturally behind <span class="DLF">fence</span> , <span class="DLF">wire fence</span> ; but otherwise it was just like a vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">What I mean is there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> nearby, and all the ladies rented <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there to come and visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And at the same time, the government started checking the individual papers of the people they had caught up in their net of internment. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">My father was one of the first to be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And about three weeks later, I was let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I went back to my work in the <span class="DLF">asbestos mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We all went back there, and...
QUESTION:  What was <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> like...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Cyprus</span> was a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">At that time, the British had about two hundred troops on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> --which kept the peace between Turkish and Greek inhabitants. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I saw quite a bit of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> while moving around. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">There have beautiful <span class="DLF">beaches</span> , and the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicosia</span> had some amazing Gothic architecture in their <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> ...
QUESTION:  I guess what I'm asking--excuse me--is not so much physically what the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> 1s like, but what was it like in wartime--under war conditions--for a Jew living in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Things were rationed, for one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And uh the Jews, Jewish refugees--thanks also to the internship--they got to know each other, and they drew together. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There was no organization yet at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But that came a little bit later with the uh evacuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But we knew quite a few people, and uh we attended uh services which was to some extent a first for me at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Naturally, after moving up to the <span class="DLF">asbestos mine</span> I had no connection ...we had no connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We were the only Jews there with the exception of the uh mine physician, who was a Russian man who had come in 1905 due to the pogroms and who didn't admit to anybody that he was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Also did not come on the evacuations. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But he and my father got friendly, so... And I had no time to be friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">After all, there were also rules that after work, after sundown, none of us were allowed to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That was strict instructions, and uh it was known in community in the <span class="DLF">asbestos mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So we stayed, and we had a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">That was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I only...there was only one <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I went there to buy our ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Every week we had a half a pound of butter, which my father got because at that time nobody thought that there was anything wrong with eating butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And we were quite lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I wrote during that time in German a treaty [NB: treatise] on my stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">One of these days, I might translate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And we stayed there until June '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We, naturally, knew what was going on in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , being away from everything, we did not pay too much attention until the Nazis invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Crete</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They got the island of Crete without any difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And then, suddenly, the good inhabitants of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> became very anxious to learn German. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Under the leadership of their bishop, a man Makarios--who afterwards what became President of the Greek part of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> --they became very uh friendly towards the expected German invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we were worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Then uh in June of '41, my father got a wire that he should be ready for evacuation within four days in the capital, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicosia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He had no money saved, because we were living from hand to mouth on whatever little money I made. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So in this twen...within twenty-four hours, we had a big sale of all our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We found that for evacuation we only...we are allowed to take two pieces of luggage each, and no more luggage than each one of us could carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Now we...during the short hours, we had to decide what to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We had to try and buy some pieces of luggage from people there, and we had to be so that we had some money in our pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We then proceeded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicosia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And there, the government had accepted two or three--I don't recall whether it was two or three men--as officers, executive officers, of the Jewish evacuation of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">With these people--and they were attorneys--started an organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Since I had nothing better to do, I helped out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They didn't, because they didn't speak Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And we had a little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and registered everybody who was ready to be evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And they had to come there with their pieces of luggage to show that what it was, and that they could actually carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And I recall one very sad episode, when a strong man came in there with rather heavy-looking pieces of luggage and the uh person behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> who registered him had some doubts whether he could really carry these pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And he uh...well, he was very uh brilliant man. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">He lifted both pieces. "</span><span class="sentence" id="186">Yeah, I can do it!" </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Dropped dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">That was quite a shock for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And people were careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We uh...we just managed the next day or two days later to bury him. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And, even the afternoon of that day, we were all put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Famagusta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The evacuation of the Jewish community of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Famagusta</span> , they put us on a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We were about five hundred people--men, women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There was a lot of complaining and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">People had to leave their uh groves, orange groves. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">People had been living for many...not just since the Nazis came, but from even from earlier years on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But we all had our lives even so we didn't have much else. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And that small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> went in zig-zag through the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean</span> at night to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> (Arab: Yafa, or Heb: Yafo].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  What <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  It was an English...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It was probably...it was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Just whatever <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> they could find there for...where we were stacked like herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Sardines is better. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And we uh got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Made us disembark, and immediately put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It was strict curfew and blackout. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , the uh Jewish Agency and the Histadrut had prepared for our arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They had set up a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> outside and there were <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The first time I saw that they had dug <span class="BUILDING">air shelter</span> , zig-zag uh shelter, cut out. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And we stayed there for a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And the next night, they...my parents and my sister and I were among the groups that was taken to <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of individual Histadrut members. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Right off <span class="DLF">Ben Yehuda Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">There were air raids nearly every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">One air raid, I think the only one where there were actually people uh caught - there were over two hundred and fifty people killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Amongst them, a friend my father afterwards tried to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">During these air raids we would meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Because my father was staying with one family, my mother with another, my sister with another, and I with another. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">In the evening, everybody went downstairs in the air raid...<span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> , and everybody along came. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">That was when we met, at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Was scary so...because we knew that people actually had died during the week or so before. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We didn't stay with these people too long, because when my father discovered that his friend had been killed he also heard from the widow and who had immediately left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">She sent my father the key to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And we stayed for the rest of our stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> in a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="DLF">Gordon Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">The only...the drawback was that the lady during that time started selling off her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So every day there was less there. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Eventually we just had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But from June through the end of November, to the middle of November, we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">During that time, the uh British government paid everyone who was a member of the Cyprus evacuation, paid them every two weeks enough money to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But they were not allowed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They had to present themselves every two weeks at an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the Jewish Agency to get the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Quite a few vanished. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , as it was then, and decided, "Well, goodbye." </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They stayed there, and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They...in the meantime, the English decided what to do with the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There were about three hundred and fifty or so left, and they divided us up into two main groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">One to go to what was then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyasaland</span> [Now: <span class="COUNTRY">Malawi</span> ], and the other one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tanganyika</span> [Now: <span class="COUNTRY">Tanzania</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So we knew our destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And there again, we subdivided the Tanganyika group to those who were going to stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, and others who would stay in a small group in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> --which was what we selected. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And we were told that we would have to proceed to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> , M- W-A-N-Z A, on the shore of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Victoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">That was a long way off, because the trip has to...had to be arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So in middle of November, finally, we were told everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We got travel papers showing that we were...we had no other papers, and that we were to proceed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tanganyika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And one hundred and seventy of us--that was the group to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tanganyika--</span> were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">At that time, there was a <span class="DLF">rail line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And they put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> ...
QUESTION:  Whoa. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Let's not move quite so fast, OK? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There are a hundred and seventy of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh, you are put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Uh, describe that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride for us, would you, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">There were both enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ... I don't remember how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> , but it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> ...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> like at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It was full of soldiers--Australians, New Zealanders, British. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And uh the uh people who received us there tried to show us as much of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We never knew whether this was a one-day stop there or two-day stop there. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">As it turned out, we were there for six or seven days. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And we had an opportunity to visit the pyramids, to see the uh <span class="BUILDING">mosques</span> , and to see the amazing traffic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I recall the flat uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> , drawn by horses or mules, where black-dressed women were sitting in rows just on the flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">That was some rich Egyptian, I guess, uh took his women for a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Otherwise, I don't recall much of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It's a picturesque <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But we were constantly worried, "What next?" </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They finally took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> again, and took us by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> --<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It was a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , as far as I remember, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Taufig</span> , on the Red Sea, on the exit of the <span class="DLF">canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And there, we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Belgian passenger ship</span> that was full of Australian and New Zealand troops on vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They were...we had one part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ; but naturally there was...we were mingled. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">It was...it was still blackout, which made it difficult to move around on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It was big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And after one day, their captain, I guess, thought it was...we were far enough away from the German and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So he lifted the blackout for a few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Because then came the news of the Japanese uh attack on Pearl Harbor.â€™ </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That was that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And we were all shivering in our boots, because we expected that they had nothing better to do but on the way out of the <span class="REGION">Red Sea</span> there would be some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ship</span> waiting to sink this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Because it was a military transport, after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And we were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The blackout was enforced more than ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We went through the Red Sea. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We went past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mombasa</span> [NB: in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> ], and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> stopped for one day to Dar-es-Salaam. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">From Dar-es- Salaam, right without stop on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to uh...that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that goes through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tanganyika</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tabora</span> , and from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tabora</span> , those members of the evacuation who were to stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They had established a camp in a former <span class="BUILDING">German prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tabora</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tanganyika</span> , naturally, had been a German colony before the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The rest of us went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We arrived there a few days before Christmas in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And there were about twelve...between twelve and seventeen--I don't recall exactly how many--we were put up in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">There was only one <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> owned by a very nice and fat Greek man, who was glad find somebody who spoke Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And the District Commissioner of the Lake Province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tanganyika</span> showed up next day to assure everybody that they uh they would continue paying everybody for as long as the war lasted, if necessary, but urging us to see if we couldn't find some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And there were indeed people, and I remember one couple that did not look for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They were paid for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And, naturally, when the war was over, the uh British government was obligated to bring everybody who wanted to back to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Now, I couldn't stand doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And thanks to the man who owned the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , I got some work in the <span class="BUILDING">recruiting office</span> of a <span class="DLF">gold mine</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They had...they sent recruiters out to the various chiefs and got people to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And they came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where I was, and I had to give them tickets to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Victoria</span> to the <span class="DLF">gold mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">That lasted about a month maybe, not much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">After that one day I came back to, for lunch to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and the Greek owner introduced me to a South African miner. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">He told me this man, this man has mining claims and he comes here every few weeks because he has to submit renewal applications for the claims to the Inspector of Mines who was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But he told me the man had so much to drink he can't draw a straight <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Please help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I helped him, drew him a map for as he told me of his <span class="DLF">mine</span> , and before he left he told me I could come to the <span class="DLF">mine</span> to work for him at I think it was ten pounds a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Anyhow it was much more than I was earning at that other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It was about a hundred miles south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And he gave me some money, which he thought at that time was payment for my efforts; but he didn't say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He ' December 7, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">said, "Here. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Whatever you need, when you...when you are ready to come." </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And he was very surprised when I showed up at his <span class="DLF">mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Before that, he had gotten so drunk not knowing what he did himself that I had to run away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He was, in his mind, under the impression that I was chasing his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And was quite an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I had to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And he was drunk, but he wasn't drunk enough to give up the chase. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And...but finally, he did so. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And uh the next day, he was all sorry and full of excuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I went to the District Commissioner and said, "Look here, what kind of man is that? </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He wants me to work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But if that's what happens, I'm scared." </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But the uh District Commissioner, whose name I have somewhere, uh assured me that I needn't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And the same of the Police Commissioner there. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So I used the paper that that miner had given me to obtain a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> from the...from one of the Indian merchants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I set out for the <span class="DLF">mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I stayed in the <span class="REGION">mining area</span> for...'til September of 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I did about everything connected with diamond mining, except the actual digging. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It sounds very interesting now, but was tough in the heat and long hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Eventually I got malaria. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I got Black Water Fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Ended up in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> with Black Water Fever, and a friendly doctor told me only about twenty-five percent of Europeans who get Black Water Fever survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Fortunately, I was amongst the twenty-five percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">In the meantime, my father had been able to get a job in his profession as pharmacist, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He was in charge of the pharmacy of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and he also was in charge of the distribution of medications for the whole province.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  What was life like for the Jews as a group there? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">What was...
ANSWER:  They were all by themselves, at least in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mwanza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">There was no connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There was one family we visited - a man who uh had lived there for many years, who was an archeologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He studied the native tribes for the British government. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And he showed me very proudly where he...he and his idiosyncracies are mentioned in a book by Hemingway. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But otherwise, there was another...the financial officer of the province also was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But he kept away from refugees, and he uh went on vacation whenever there was a Christian holiday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  You... We have a couple of minutes left. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Uh, tell me, you said you were there until 1946.</span></p>
