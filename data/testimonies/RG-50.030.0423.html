<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  I wanted to ask, before the Anschluss, and you mentioned specifically that when you were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you were sitting in, you were in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> singing and they stopped, the teacher asked you to stop, was that the only incident that was before March 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  No, the only incident of anti-Semitism that I experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  No, there were many, that was just a representative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  That was a representative, there were many, and on the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was the usual bullying. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My parents took the attitude that whether it was racial or not, I had to fight my own fights, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">The anti-Semitism was generic and general and you picked up on it in many subtle ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was not usually violent, except as when kids fought on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , although I do remember one incident which may give you the flavor of it, is before the Anschluss, some of us kids were playing in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I was, chasing each other, reckless, I didn't look, plunging across the <span class="DLF">street</span> head first and ran into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicyclist</span> hard enough, I bent the front wheel of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> badly enough so he couldn't ride it. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I got some good cuts and bruises out of that one, but he immediately found out who I was, knew who my father was and he was a local Nazi, remember this was before the Anschluss, and he marched me and his damaged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to <span class="BUILDING">Dad's store</span> and swung enough weight by virtue of his party membership so that before Dad could even attend to me and take me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span> , which was done later, he had to pay the man off for the damage to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , cash then and there or else, and the or else could and probably would have been beatings, damage to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">After the Anschluss, and very quickly saw, there was such an explosion of uniforms, Hitler youth and so on, amazingly fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">There were round-ups of Jews in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , made to scrub the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">This happened to a distant relative of ours, and elderly woman, not in good health and when some of the people standing around made remarks about that to the storm troopers who were conducting the street scrubbing, one of them walked over to the woman and said, well I think maybe you can get up and leave, it seems you're not Jewish, and she said, yes I am, I'm 400% Jewish, all four of my grandparents are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">A similar thing happened to my mother who was rounded up between piano lessons, on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and she was blonde, blue-eyed, petite. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">If you wanted a poster girl for your Aryan woman, she would have been it, and again when she was down there scrubbing <span class="DLF">streets</span> , people started to mutter that these stupid SS men, SA men didn't know what they were doing, look at this, and one of them told mom to get up and get out of there and she said, no I'm Jewish, I belong here the same as the rest of these people, I'll go when they go. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I think that was a very short-lived, street scrubbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It wasn't always that kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  So immediately after Anschluss, you immediately felt an impact on your personal lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  It was immediate and it was massive. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">In the popular support, and you heard nothing against it, no one spoke against it, and my parents got busy, my father particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Remember him telling my mother that it was only a matter of days before the Nuremberg laws were applied, as indeed they were, and that they had to do everything possible to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Now I later came across, in my parents personal papers, and then they're both dead now, correspondence to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chili</span> , anywhere possible to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">What eventually happened was that my mother found employment as a housemaid in a <span class="BUILDING">rural English household</span> , I think through an <span class="BUILDING">employment agency</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Through a <span class="BUILDING">refugee agency</span> , a <span class="NPIP">place</span> was found for me in an <span class="BUILDING">English boarding school</span> , an Orthodox Jewish boarding school which would take me in, because the law at that time was if you were an adult you could enter <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> only if you had proof of employment, if you were a child, you had to have proof that somebody would take you in, well my mother's employers would not allow a child, however the place in the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> sufficed for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , the , the west railway in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> by my father and a few family friends, I had no brothers or sisters and took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , exiting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at _—_— through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and then to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">channel boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , except that at _—_, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stopped, all Jews were taken off, rounded up and surrounded by heavily armed police, SS and others, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The reason for that, I don't know, it could have been that one person on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had tried to smuggle contraband out, at least that's what was said. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We were standing in a cluster approximately, I would guess about 40 or 50 refugees with our luggage, such as it was, and tightly hemmed in by armed guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My mother, Mia Treuer and I, were in the middle of this cluster and she took a quick look around, clamped my hand in hers and we each had a suitcase in the other hands and whispered to me, she said, don't look, don't say anything, come. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And she marched through the middle of this packed little crowd, between two guards looking neither left nor right and they looked a little surprised and she kept right on going, I with her, into the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , <span class="BUILDING">station restaurant</span> , where I had the first cup of coffee in my life, and we sat very quietly, she and I at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">restaurant table</span> , nursing a coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I don't know what happened to the rest of the refugees taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We sat in that <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> for hours until the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came, at which time I was ready to leap up and run for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and with one look at my mom and I sat right where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">People got off that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , other people got on and she didn't make a move. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was just bursting with impatience because I knew I was waiting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And at the last moment she said, very abrupt, come. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We grabbed our suitcases, out the <span class="DLF">door</span> , up the steps of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it started to move, it was moving as we found <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and seconds later, we were out. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I owe her my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Not only in the sense that she gave me birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The trip through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was uneventful and the channel crossing eventful only by my getting sick to my stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Took the __ <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where my father's brother was waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I don't know how he got out, I suspect he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> illegally, but I don't know the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He met us at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , took us to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">As we rounded the corner to enter the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , roof to <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , Nazi banners are flying there and I panicked, I was terrified, I didn't know what had happened, were we back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or what? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But it turned out some sporting event and the Nazi team was being hosted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The next morning my mother took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for her employment out in the <span class="REGION">country side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">My uncle took me to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I was to attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Turned out to be an <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The headmaster, my recollection is a black coat, white shirt, black tie, a black hat, full beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Looked me over as I was brought into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and said this boy is not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My hair was. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My uncle assured him that I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I was quizzed on my knowledge of Hebrew which was nonexistent, although in a cram course, an effort was made to teach me something before I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It hadn't taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And although my knowledge of English was very limited, I only had a few words at that time, I understood very clearly that he wouldn't take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Because this was a strict religious school and he could not violate the integrity of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My uncle pleaded with him, first time I ever heard my uncle plead with anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He was a mountain climber, kayaker, skier, and boyhood idol of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But he pleaded, he said there was a real risk and a danger that if I were not where I was supposed to be I would be deported and no questions asked, it would be immediate, and his pleading must have had some effect because the headmaster of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did consider it and he asked one more question, I didn't understand the English, it had to be translated for me, and the question was, was I circumcised and the answer was no, and he said, no we can't take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Not even for one day, not for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We left. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Just how my uncle found another <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , I don't know if this one was religious secular. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I don't know, but before the end of the day he had found another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that would take me in free, there was no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">What little our family had had been sequestered and we had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">This <span class="BUILDING">school</span> turned out to be a <span class="DLF">snake pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My first night there, sleeping in the large <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> with many other boys my age, one started screaming in great pain, and I tried to find out from the boy in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> next to mine what was going on and I didn't understand the English, and he pointed at his appendix and I knew what that was, the boy had appendicitis and he screamed for a long time before finally some of the staff showed up and the gist of what they had told him was to turn over and pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Well I understood that clearly enough, I found myself in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where if you had appendicitis, you prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The next day the other kids went to various classes, I had no English, they told me to hang around in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I was raped before the day was out, by a staff member. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I told no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I felt responsible for what had happened, it was my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I didn't _ find out until long afterwards that this is a common reaction of victims, of child victims of sexual abuse that the child takes on the bad feelings about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It's a simple phenomenon, I know it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">During the magic years of childhood, the adult can do no wrong and if something happens between a child and an adult that is wrong, it cannot be the fault of the adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And I was a very small, pint-sized 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  So your mother was living separately from you obviously, she was working away from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Yes, she lived with the people that she worked for out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I'm not clear just exactly where in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , she worked for a Major Woodiwiss, who was a widower with I believe some children and she was expected to keep the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> clean and take care of the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  So you really had no one close to you that you could talk to about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  My uncle did come to visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He had made it plain to me that I could not stay wherever he was staying and I had the impression that he shifted <span class="NPIP">places</span> to stay every couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">This is what makes me think that he was there illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There was a small handful of Austrian socialists there who tried to help each other and apparently he would sleep with one family one night or two and then move on and I didn't tell htm what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He could tell quickly enough that something was out of whack but he didn't know what, nor could he do much about it except that he did get me out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He made connections with another Vienna socialist who was the director of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> for Spanish orphans, these were the orphans of ____, the surviving children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basque</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and the British while they would not help the Spanish Republicans, did put up a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , a temporary <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> in <span class="DLF">Kensington Park</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> of Peter Pan, I'm told, and the Viennese socialists whom my uncle knew and who it turned out also knew my father, they made a deal and my uncle came and got me from that <span class="DLF">snake pit</span> and took me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> where the director of the camp met me at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He said are you Bobby Treuer? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I was carrying my tiny, little red cardboard suitcase, which I still have, I said yes, he said, you are Fritz Treuer's son? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He said I know a Fritz Treuer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He said run, and I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I ran through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> and dark haired, dark skinned kids saw another dark hair, dark skin kid coming and they enveloped me and I disappeared into one of the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They didn't speak German, I didn't speak Spanish, none of us had much English, we all spoke survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We supported and loved one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">One day there was news of a Republican victory in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , I don't know how it got it, and there was an impromptu torchlight parade and we ran around the perimeter of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , was so happy, somebody was fighting for us, and they won. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We ran around there until we dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It was only four or five days later and the black bordered envelopes came, the typical European death notices were bordered in black, the envelopes were, and mail call, and one kid after another came and picked up his mail, and each of us felt we had died a little bit because we knew enough about defeats, I had known about them ever since 1934, one fight after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">One escape after another and finally a smell of a little victory somewhere and then the death notices, oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There's an incident that happened to me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> before we left that I want to tell you, two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was riding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> , forget whether it was on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and a bunch of Hitler youth spotted me, and they must have seen the Jewish insignia on my streetcar pass, and one of them said, get him, and I leaped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> , ran in front of it, there was one coming the other way and the motorman was clanging with his footbell because the two were just about head to head and I had ducked in front of that one and ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I remember correctly, I ran across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , over a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and onto the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">House</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">19th district</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but by ducking between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> I lost my pursuers, by the time both <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> were gone, so was I. My kids ask me, well, my American boy and kids have asked me when I told them about this, if they would have killed me, and I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I tell them I didn't stick around and find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And another incident that comes to mind, about the same time before we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I had to go to the dentist, to get some cavity filled and the dentist had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for a few moments to do something, get something, and I happened to notice some publication from the Nazi party lying on that round tray where he keeps his instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I was a nosy kid, I want to find out what they were telling him, and they were instructions to dentists, what particular political points were to be made by the dentist in discussion with the patient while he was treating them and the instruction to bear down with your drill to reinforce a point. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Clear recollection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  This is, you took this to mean that he was also involved in torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No, the use of pain to reinforce.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Is all, I didn't take that to be any more torture than I thought dentists customarily dished out. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Now you said you wanted to ask me some questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Yes, I wanted at first to talk about your father, you mentioned before Anschluss, before he was involved with the Socialists, but at the time you didn't know that, that was something you learned afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  It was something I learned afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  But did you remember anything about him going to meetings or friends that he was...
ANSWER:  He did, now during that __ between the time the fascists took over in 1934 and the Anschluss in 1938, he did take me with him to visit friends sometimes and I remember one time he was visiting a friend and, who played a Victrola or phonograph for him of some Schubert —_—__, and they were saying oh, we better keep the volume down, this one is forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It was a Schubert song, I forget now, , Your Thoughts are Free, well that was forbidden, and one of the things that happened shortly after the 1934 putsch that I remember, the Austrian government had negotiated and art exhibit of ____ cartoons and prints with the French government, and the arrangement had been made before February 1934, but the exhibit arrived much later and it couldn't be canceled, it would have been awkward, and the workers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> turned out by the thousands because they couldn't be stopped from going to see it and of course these were political satire and was a way of expressing how they felt, and they stood there by the thousands in absolute silence, not knowing who would report anyone for any comment, to view the ___ exhibition in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There must be other memories lurking in the back of my mind about things that my father did then, but.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  You said he was a shopkeeper, that was his, what kind of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  He ran a little <span class="BUILDING">stationery store</span> , little bit of candy, which was too high for me to reach and ran a typing and mimeographing service in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and one of the ways in which they distributed the underground newspapers, which by then were printed in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> on tissue paper, was that he did a lot of typing, mimeographing for a man by the name of Leon Schalit, who was the official translator of Galsworthy's works into German, and what Dad and his associate did was slipsheet the underground newspapers into the book manuscript to be returned to Schalit, and Ernst Pollit(ph) who helped my Dad, had to make almost daily trips back and forth between <span class="BUILDING">Dad's shop</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Schalit's home</span> , and this was a means of getting the newspapers out. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Ironically, a high Vienna police official lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that housed my dad's <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and had two armed guards standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> all the time and they would check Pollit(ph) periodically and find out what he was carrying, but the packages were so big and heavy and clumsy that they didn't want to bother with him and they saw him every day, so they were never caught for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">During the first days of the fascist takeover in '34, the underground newspaper was printed on the presses of the largest newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">After that paper had finished it's first run, the printer stayed behind and ran off the underground newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They got away with that for months until some bookkeeper upstairs in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> found out that the electricity bills were higher than they used to be and they got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Well one thing leads to another, I remember my father meeting with some streetcar motorman and the discussion was how to distribute underground newspapers at a big football game, and they came up with this system that the <span class="DLF">streetcar line</span> ended next to the <span class="BUILDING">football stadium</span> and that the motorman had a few minutes between runs and they used, they would ball up the newspapers and fire them over the <span class="DLF">outside walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> with slingshots, and they fell amongst the audience. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Nota very efficient system, but what can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">You wanted to ask some?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Oh sure, again about your father, you mentioned it was, this was after March 1938, or was it, maybe I didn't understand, but he during the summertime went and he created another identity, you said, as a?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He did this before the Nazis came, he had a pretty keen sense of what might happen, and I believe continued that after he had shipped Mom and me out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He closed the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">All the goods and contents had been taken anyhow by the concierge's daughter and son-in-law, he was SS, they took the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and Dad just disappeared and I believe he lapsed into that identity, but in mean, had to come back again frequently to process his papers for his exit. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Now, his recollections tome ___ Vienna visits, were that he had to stand in a long <span class="DLF">line</span> at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Vienna</span> , I believe he said it was the Imperial if I remember correctly, had been taken over by SS, to process exit visas and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He said as he got there early in the morning, two <span class="DLF">lines</span> had formed, he stood in the one he believed he had to go through, and the other <span class="DLF">line</span> were elderly couples and it turned out that these people were undergoing compulsory divorce if one was Aryan and the other one Jewish, they were compelled to be divorced and he described to me not only the utter silence in which both <span class="DLF">lines</span> inched forward, but the weeping, the old people as they came back down, not knowing where to go, what to do, with whom they could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was pitiful, absolutely pitiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">During that time also, while my father was back and forth between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and his farm laborer identity, he had to pass a medical examination, which revealed him to have a hernia. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The Nazis wouldn't let him out unless that were operated on. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He underwent the operation and was not given anesthesia and pleaded with the doctor for anesthetic after the incision was started and the doctor put the scalpel down, he said, you have your choice, if you want your exit papers signed, you'll let us go ahead, otherwise I can sew you up right now, and Dad said go ahead, and he eventually fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He moved from <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and went through , and had to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> once again a couple of days before he had a ticket to get out and get into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Again I don't, job as a gardener or a houseman or something had been found for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The morning he was to leave, there wasa____,, the <span class="DLF">street</span> was sealed off, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> pulled up, they were going <span class="DLF">door</span> to <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They came, and he was renting a <span class="INT_SPACE">lower room</span> for one night in somebody else's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he heard them coming and he was on the way out, and they came to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> before his, and he watched them through a crack in the <span class="DLF">door</span> , didn't know how to get out and suddenly they were preoccupied with finding a World War | bayonet in somebody's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser drawer</span> and the man to whom it belonged was anxiously explaining what this was and so on, they were all clustered around him, so Dad marched out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , snapped a Heil(ph) Hitler salute and they didn't turn around, they said Heil(ph) Hitler, he walked past them or out. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We'll never know whether they were looking for him or anybody in particular but he got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Got out, came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and he and Mom wound up working in the same <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Now maybe I'd better backtrack because by that time, I was no longer in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  You had left <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> just shortly after the Anschluss, the middle of 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  We left <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , my mother and I, in August of '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Anschluss was in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My Dad didn't come out until November, December, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Justright after
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Let's see, they left me at the Spanish children's home, the Basque children's home, but that was temporary.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  And the second one, what you said was, I wanted to ask about that, that was obviously very difficult, how long were you there? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Just a few days or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  It's a time warp, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I would thinks some weeks, I'm not sure how long, nor can I say with accuracy how long I was in the Spanish children's home. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">No sense of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But you realize even that wasn't secure, because I was there illegally, and unbeknownst to me, the Society of Friends, the Quakers were working on my situation and found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me that was both safe and legal, and that was <span class="BUILDING">Newtown Boarding School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterford</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I made the trip, I believe alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Arrangements had been made for an Irish Quaker family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dublin</span> to meet me and they in turn put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dublin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterford</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I thought myself very competent and capable and __—_ and doing a lot of traveling on my own and coping with a lot of different situations, I have a clear recollection of arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterford</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> , late leaving, it was very dark, little misty, damp, sooty at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , there were four or five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and hardly anybody got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and this huge man stood there waiting for me, a very ruddy face, fairly tight curled white hair, and he said, are you Bobby Treuer, and I said, yes I am, he said, I am Mr. Marsh, I'm the headmaster of <span class="BUILDING">Newtown school</span> , and he wrapped my hand in his big paw and he led me off, and I knew I was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I was safe not only in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I was safe with that man. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And <span class="BUILDING">Newtown school</span> , which had been in existence, well now it's almost 200 years, they had almost gone out of business by the 1920's, early '30's, so many <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> of that kind did and Marsh, I later found out had come along and said, if you give me a free hand, I will run the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and not take any salary until such time as I can get it to pay for itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">He had very strong educational ideas, that education had to be both practical, hands- on, personal involvement and a sense of community, and each child had to be challenged and allowed to develop their own bents and abilities to the max. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">A lot was expected, but it was within your own terms, it was the first time, the first time in my life that I had a taste of freedom, where I was accepted and valued as an individual, encouraged to define and identify myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And quite literally, <span class="BUILDING">Newtown school</span> and the Quakers, Mr. Marsh, not only saved my life in that they saved me from deportation, they saved my life spiritually. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Started me out on a long journey of finding my own worth. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Let's take a break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Okay. [</span><span class="sentence" id="166">pause] I just wanted to ask about the incident at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , when you were raped, did you know the person well? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was just the second day you were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  It was the second day I was there, he was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and before I knew it, I don't know, I can't recall just how he got me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">men's latrine</span> , I recall the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> , smelly, narrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Afterwards I felt that I had lured him there, and that couldn't have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That could not have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That was my recollection, that was my feeling at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Were you able to make any friends there, or was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  And you don't really...
ANSWER:  I was a solitary, and again I don't remember exactly how long I was there, it was, it had to have been a couple of weeks at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I remember Uncle Richard coming to get me on a Sunday to take me on an outing, he took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hyde Park</span> , he tried to explain to me people speaking on their soapboxes, I was totally _____ by then and he was really leaning on me hard to learn English, and constantly looking over his shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That was a bad one, that was a bad time. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And the damn thing is that when you've been victimized, and especially as a child and you take it on yourself, what happens is you wind up like as though you're wearing a neon sign on your forehead, you assume the victim personality and that makes you vulnerable and you get hit on time and again, and it did happen time and again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  So that wasn't the only time, and was that repeatedly there or was it just?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  No, that was a one time incident there, but there are many forms of victimization. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I was sexually abused or assaulted or whatever you want to call it on at least two other occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Not in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but over subsequent years. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I think it had less to do with my being physically small than with my body language and how I felt about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I think that's commonplace for victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I've had to do a lot of work on that, but it helps to talk about it, and it my talking about it helps somebody else, I'm glad to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I have taken four of my seven children back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I've taken them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , which of course is in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , I've taken them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , which to me is the epitome of horror, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , ah, the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , there are the instructions on what to do with the pregnant women when they were brought in, and the instructions said, up to the eighth month, abort them. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">After the eighth month, kill the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">That was done through suffocation, injection, smash the skull or use them for medical experiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">God damn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191"><span class="NPIP">Hell</span> , I wanted my children to know, they were wanted, and that there was a time when infants were killed and the children were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And my father's mountain climbing partner, his name was Shreiber(ph) wound up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , and we found out what happened to him, he was a strong man, he was short but he was strong mountain climber, he and Dad, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> , and , and he was one of those who had to carry the 50 kilo boulder up those 186 uneven steps to the top and they pointed him aside and had him walk over to the <span class="DLF">precipice</span> and dump the boulder over, so he could carry it up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And as he went limp after dumping it, they pushed him in the small of the back with a swagger stick and he went over the brink, and he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I wanted my children to see that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I wanted them to see the pretty <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , with the neat <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and the window boxes with the flowers, so that they would know that the people who killed the babies and who pushed people over the edge of a <span class="DLF">precipice</span> went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after work and played with their kids in their pretty little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with the window boxes and the flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I wanted my children to see the beauty of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and the people and the horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And I hope, I pray and I hope that I can, that I have taught my children that the capacity to harm another human being exists in each of us. __—_—__ </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And this does not excuse the holocaust, where society evoked and made possible and End of Tape 1 Tape 2
QUESTION:  ...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where you stayed briefly and who was in control of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> who was running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then a little bit about your life there and what, day to day life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  You know, memory is like a strobe light, you get a little iJlumination here and there and the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I can't really give you a daily routine and the only thing I remember about the camp management was that an Austrian socialist and his wife, whose names I don't even remember, I seem to recall that the older Spanish kids assumed responsibilities for keeping it organized and keeping it running, I don't remember any staff in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I remember Sundays, Sundays, well- meaning Britishers came to take children out for an outing and this was a bit chaperoned in that one or two would always go along, nobody would be alone, but clearly recall an older English person, seemed older to me, must have been a middle aged man, who obviously was enamored of a very pretty Spanish girl who must have been 16 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And we kids talked about it amongst ourselves, and I remember saying to one of the older Spanish boys, this is not right, I said, besides her boyfriend here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is, I forget his name, and the older boy looked at me and he said, yeah, but if he will, he meaning the Englishman, will keep her here, or marry her, she'll be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And the rest of us are going to have to go back, and we'll all be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And even at 12 years old, I felt the moral imperatives there. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">A young person was being exploited and allowing herself to be exploited for her safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Yeah, we buy, we buy our survival in many ways, and I was judgmental and critical as a 12 year old, for only a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">A matter of seconds, but that strange rapport and that love I then formed with those Spanish peers of mine, has off and on touched my life several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It's hard to define or explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">When I was what, 15, 16? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I worked for a few weeks one summer for the Pioneer ——— ~Corn Company, corn, even though I was short and it was very hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I worked the <span class="DLF">fields</span> a migrant laborer, and it was hard work, it was beautiful work, but I couldn't keep up, but somehow that rapport clicked, I never spoke to the migrant Mexican workers about my experiences, but the rapport developed and they would finish their <span class="DLF">rows</span> and come down <span class="DLF">mine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  To help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So that I could keep up, and would not be fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Although I tried as hard as I could.</span></p>
