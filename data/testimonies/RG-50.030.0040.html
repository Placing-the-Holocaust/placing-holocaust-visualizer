Coincidental, a couple of days before that, there was a draft board. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They were drafting soldiers for the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Being I was on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> , we had to go to a draft board. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Of course, it was real strange because we were naked and most of the people were women, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And, uh, when they were measuring you and this and that, and they asked me what kind of education I got, I say I got <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I got electronics. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And she said you be a lieutenant in the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I think that was Friday or something or Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Sunday morning, somebody knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , all the people who got drafted and say, "We got a meeting in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Move your tail." </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We didn't know anything would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We get in the <span class="BUILDING">movie theatre</span> , the draftees. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And this Russian general, whatever, come out and said that the German pig stuck a...

It's just wearing those uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">They were kind of blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Because the soldiers were wearing green, and so I think they SS people.</span></p>
