<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Circumstances, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Well, I was in the labor came and one day my older friend approached me and said, Cornell, next morning when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulls out from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , you and I are staying, and we going to hide someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We are not leaving with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Cause the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going on and on and on of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And, of course, my -- my closest friends were my age, see, he was a little bit older, maybe wiser, and he had certain ideas, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So next day as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was ready to pull out, and that was in hunga -- <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , of course, he -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move and I had sort of, you know my younger friends, they were all going up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I was ready to move on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he grabbed -- fortunately he grabbed my arm, he says, we’re staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And we didn’t stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out, and then we hit the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and we walked on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And after awhile we got off the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , because it was dangerous, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were coming with Hungarian soldiers, and maybe German soldiers, we didn’t want to stay on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , too obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So we moved off the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and about maybe quarter of a mile, half a mile, and there was some water there, and some little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and we just sat down there and was waiting for the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We’re thinking what’s going to happen now, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Actually it was -- well, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> at that time, yeah, because it was always back and forth <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And before it got dark, some Hungarian soldiers stopped on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and came towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So we got sort of a little bit scared, but then you have to act cool, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And as they were getting closer and closer, we got up and we waved to them.
