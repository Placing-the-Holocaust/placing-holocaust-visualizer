QUESTION:  Tell me about when you were born and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where you grew up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  | was born in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> by the name of Forth, which is 23 kilometers north east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">It's between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">By-roit</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="3"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">By-roit</span> (ph), the famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wagner town</span> where the fesh-beeler (ph) had taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And | lived, | was born in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in July of 1913, shortly before the outbreak of World War |. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And hardly got to know my father because he died, to some degree as a result of World War |, in 1919 when | was hardly six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">| lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and went to the <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , which then was an all-Jewish school. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Which is interesting because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had become centers of Jewish life when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was not, | mean it was no longer permissible to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was one of the so-called principal <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and it was only, | believe, in the middle of the 19" century or early 19" century that the Jews were again allowed to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And that is, at that time, when the Jews began to leave these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">When | grew up, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> had a total population of probably 1,200 and a Jewish population of maybe ten families, enough to have a so-called Minion (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But it wasn't long, and | would say it was in my third year of <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , that the Jewish community could no longer afford to have the Jewish teacher and also he had doubled as a Huss-in (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="12">A Huss-in (ph) is who holds the prayers on Fritz Schnaittacher 2 [Date not labeled] Page 2 Saturdays and Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Then the Jewish kids were being transferred to the so-called <span class="BUILDING">government school</span> , which was in the main, a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We also had a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And |! </span><span class="sentence" id="16">went to, | attended the <span class="BUILDING">government school</span> for a period of two years and then, because of the lack of better educational facilities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , | moved to a so-called , a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and from there went to <span class="BUILDING">High School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">That for a period of six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Thereafter, | took a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It is well to mention that on weekends, when | started to work, | would visit my mother and Aunts who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , twenty-three kilometers away. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Anti-Semitism began to become noticeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And | never forget an incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="22"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had a deep, what do you call it? . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">A fortification. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And we played soccer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And one guy with a hammer and sickle on his cap came to assist us to, to ward off a bunch of Nazi kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Do you know when this would have been or how old you were then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">| was 11 years old and that would have been in 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Shalll.. .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Let me ask you about that incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Do you remember what the provocation was? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">How do you know they were Nazi sympathizers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  There was no provocation on our part. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">It was simply an attack on the part of these Nazi kids who recognized us as being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And they stormed upon us and tried to beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But this lonely Communist beat them off and it's an experience which | will never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  How did you know that they were Nazi kids? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Were they wearing anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Did they say something? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Fritz Schnaittacher 3 [Date not labeled] Page 3
ANSWER:  They wore swastikas and they called us dirty Jews, etceteras. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Now the Nazism in certain <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> was so strong that it was necessary for the Director of the <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> to have me transferred to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was less stigmatized and coincidentally, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from which | had to be transferred was near the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> where ultimately the War Crimes Trials took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It's, there are so many things that are unusual coincidences in my life, that some, that was in 1924, and | interrogated the Chief of Staff of the German Army, Ky-kle (ph), in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And he had to get up and salute me. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Also one of the many unforgettable incidences. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">To bring us more up to date, beyond the period of time that | had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and when | started to work for a company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and that was in 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And it was from then on that | would regularly visit my mother on weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">This brings us to the time when the Nazi propaganda began to become extremely aggressive and particularly then, in the year 1932, when in spite of the enormous propaganda that was being put over the German people, Hitler's popularity began to shrink. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And there were two elections. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">One was in the summer of 1932 and one was in the fall of 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And particularly the election in the fall of 1932 reflected a decrease in the popularity of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Which ultimately then, on January 30", 1933 led to Hindenberg's decision to appoint Hitler Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was followed up by another election, at the beginning of March of 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Which Hitler won only in combination with all the other parties other than the Social Democrats and the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And it was so deeply unfortunate that these two left wing parties had failed to really create one common front. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">History would have been different, at least my belief. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">After the Fritz Schnaittacher 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 election, when Hitler considered himself in sole power of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , then the wave of Anti-Semitism was enormously increased and this was the time when already <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> were being pilfered or destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And it ultimately led to a very important, personal incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">On one of the visits in the middle of March to my mother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , | was hardly at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , when there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and a policeman, the local gendarme, came into our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and said, "Mr. Schnaittacher, | would like to see you at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="59">When | arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , he very briskly told me that | was under arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And again, it was one of these painful, painful moments when | had to call up my mother, who had a severe cold, and | had to tell her, "Mother, I'm under arrest." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Well, she was shrieking and she came storming out to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason whatsoever, but obviously it did not do any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was too small to have a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of it's own and so | was transported to the County seat of Earl-la-len (ph) where | then, as dusk began to settle, was put into a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">police prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And | was being welcomed by four or five other prisoners who had already been in there, as a result of having been anti-Nazis, not Jewish, but anti-Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Shall | continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But I'm curious about a couple of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">One, was there, did you have any hint when you were taken in, why you were taken in? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> at the time that you were arrested in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> , is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Fritz Schnaittacher 9) [Date not labeled] Page 5
QUESTION:  How does that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Did you have any sense of why? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">How they would even have known of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">| had no idea why | was being arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">However, as | was turned over to the warden of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , | requested information. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Why | was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And he then, either that night or the following morning, gave me a slip of paper which indicated that | was arrested because of having agitated against the National Socialist Government because of knowledge of secret ammunition depots and liaison of illegal anti-Nazi organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Now, actually, yes | was an anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I was no longer involved in anti-Nazi activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So the actual reason was to provide the local populace of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with a degree of satisfaction, to have me arrested as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And another cousin of mine who was the only other young male Jew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And it was quite an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">As | was given the easiest job in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and that was to fill, we didn't have running water in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , but each one of us would get a water pitcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And it was my job to fill the water basins that we used to wash ourselves with. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And to fill these pitchers with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And in doing so, | turned around and there sits my cousin in the adjoining <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Well we had a very friendly greeting, and surprising so. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The moment that! </span><span class="sentence" id="89">had gotten into <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> my mother did not rest for a minute and pursued every possible approach in order to have me liberated, as well as my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And then followed some six weeks later and | was, which would make it the beginning of May, and, no, it made it the end of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Of 1933? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Fritz Schnaittacher 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6
ANSWER:  When | was released from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , my cousin as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And | was on parole for two months, which meant that | had to report to a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> every other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Shall | continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Let me take you back just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You mentioned that you were an anti-Nazi but weren't involved in anti-Nazi activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What did it mean to you at that time, or what kind of activities had you been involved in? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">What was sort of the culture of anti-Nazism where you were living, when you were | guess about 20 years old? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">With your friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">What were you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">What were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Well we would have seminars to gain an understanding of what it would mean, of what Nazism meant and what it meant not only to the Jews but the people at large. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The total oppression of several <span class="REGION">areas</span> and after all, when, | want to be sure that is right. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">When <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> finally collapsed there were over 300,000 non-Jewish prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And the anti-Nazi forces were, they were primarily the Social Democrats and the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And who really fought Hitler physically and with all the idealism and principal and firmness possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But | had the opportunity, after | was released not only from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> but from the parole, to travel as a salesman within limited scope. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Not by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> but by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And | never forget that some very simple people who had taken the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> | did in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , that they expressed without fear when they recognized me as a Jew, that Hitler is the enemy of all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">By the way, | failed to, when | corrected myself before with regard to the time that | left <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And because of the danger of again being re-arrested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , | left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and moved with an Uncle of mine Fritz Schnaittacher 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And it was May 1%, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The reason that | am pointing out in this very interesting coincidence, | came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> on May 1*, 1945, as the conquering American soldier after having liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I'm not speaking of myself but my regiment, my division, and it was to be sure one of the greatest moments in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you were afraid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , that you would be re-arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Was there a sense that they were watching you? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It seems that if they arrested you when you went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you didn't live there, they must have somehow known you were coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not have been a <span class="BUILDING">police prison</span> but it would have meant to be sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> at that time was not an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> but it was a camp of terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And personally violent persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">At that time the, a few friends of mine were shot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the proverb, if you can call it that, was created: shot while attempting to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Now, so | lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> having been relieved from the duty to report to <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span> , and | had the goal, as soon as possible, as early as possible, to be able to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And particularly so because on a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , not to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , | had arranged, my mother had arranged to meet me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in order to spend a pleasant weekend together. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">When she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been here today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We give you the opportunity to defend yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My mother had been extremely courageous and Fritz Schnaittacher 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 she screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now because the following day she was going to leave the <span class="REGION">area</span> to live with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And that's what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And that, the , the precarious actions of my mother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">| had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We had an interesting, rewarding time here. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Cost of living was extremely low and even though | only earned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And to enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It is interesting to note that this now is the late fall of 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My brother had lived here already. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He came, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived here, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married and therefore didn't have any other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And my brother entered his business and later on | joined him. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00, $17.00 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">On <span class="DLF">96" Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Western Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the, what's the name of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Paris</span> , which had a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and we could go swimming every night, for 25 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And it was really a wonderful way of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Burdened only by our concern for our in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Can | ask you, before you came over, you sound like you were quite close with your mother, were you having conversations with her about whether you should go? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Did she give you any advice about the climate in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and how that should effect your decision to, did you talk about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Fritz Schnaittacher 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9
ANSWER:  Yes indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There was my mother, two spinster Aunts on my father's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">There were two brothers of my mother's who were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And one of them had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And my mother insisted that | should leave as soon as possible after | was able to get a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And | left with a great deal of reticence because of leaving my mother over there, but she promised that she would visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And indeed she did the following year. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for over six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Then because of her love for her mother and the feeling of obligation that she had for her, she came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in order to take care of her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And it was then, only after the Crystalnaught (ph), after my mother suffered a nervous breakdown, that she and her mother, and Uncles and Aunts and cousins, all ultimately were brought over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So we were extremely fortunate that we didn't lose anybody in the Holocaust. [</span><span class="sentence" id="157">End of Side 1 of Tape 1]
QUESTION:  It was that they hadn't lost anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So this brings us up to 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And when my mother was the first member of the family after myself to then come back in order to remain here. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we hada small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="DLF">Western Avenue</span> and <span class="DLF">80" Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And then we, where some cousins had lived, and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And when my mother came, we rented, no, first she stayed with my Uncle, and then later on when her mother came as well, we rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="DLF">151% Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Which is the southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And at that time it was just a wonderful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You never, day or night, you would never fear of any attack or of any incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And so my brother, who by then had gotten married and his wife was pregnant, and |, and Fritz Schnaittacher 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10 my mother and grandmother, we lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">five room apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And then, when other Uncles and Aunts came, we just doubled up. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">There was never any complaint. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">There was only the utmost of happiness, to have succeeded in bringing our relatives out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And even as far as, which is of some significance with regard to the question that has been raised, the integration of refugees into American life. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">There was an Aunt of mine who then was in her late 30's or early 40's, and she didn't have any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And she and her husband, through another friend of theirs, started to pull threads out of pieces of cloth in order to separate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And they started to do that in our <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And from there they developed a business where ultimately they employed some forty people on <span class="DLF">26" Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And when my Uncle and Aunt ultimately died, they took care of their nieces and nephews, not having had any children of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And that went for ever so many of the people, that no job was low enough as long as they were able to sustain themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Whether young women that worked in <span class="BUILDING">households</span> , or in <span class="BUILDING">factory jobs</span> , notwithstanding, very good educations. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And this, | think, is one of the unique aspects of this immigration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Can | ask you, did your mother and Uncles and Aunts talk much about their experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after you left, in the years leading up to the time that they 2? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">What did they tell you about what was going on and what their experiences were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Well that's a very good question because it leads me to one of the most satisfying experiences that | had. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">As | had mentioned early, | had worked for my Uncle who Fritz Schnaittacher 11 [Date not labeled] Page 11 had a wholesale business of glassware and chinaware located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And when he came over here, he told me the following story. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">When he approached as it was customary his place of business on the morning of the Crystalnaught (ph), the manager of the business, not Jewish, to wnom | had been reported when | worked for him, was standing at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to this business in the uniform of a storm trooper, and said, "Jews are not allowed here.". </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And my Uncle did not protest because he recognized the threat that was behind him and he turned around, went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and within a few hours a Nazi knocked on his <span class="DLF">door</span> and arrested him and took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And the same thing happened to his brother, who lived some hundreds of miles away from where he lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So my two Uncles were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and that was in November 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And finally they were able to get out in January of, | believe January of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The Uncle with whom | had lived, the one who had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , because of the totally inadequate clothing that they received in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , suffered severe circulatory problems and that’s what he died from some years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But this is the story that he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So now, we go back, or we advance to the year 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Fritz, as a member of the 157'" Regiment of the 45" Division, contributed to the conquest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And as soon as | had the time to follow up on this story which | told you, | went into my Uncle's place of business which had been bombed out, but people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And | inquired for the name of Hermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Hermann was the name of the fellow who had been the manager of my Uncle's business, who was responsible for sending him back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and having him arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And so this is now May 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And | finally got Fritz Schnaittacher 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 information as to where Hermann lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And | had the deep, deep satisfaction of locating him, having been an officer | had the privilege of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> , and | drove out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And people gleefully would point in the direction where Hermann lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And there he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">| recognized him at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And he just wore pants and long johns. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And | told him in a not too friendly a manner that he should get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">His wife and daughter protested vehemently. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And | took him to the <span class="BUILDING">CIC Headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> where | interrogated him. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And fortunately for me, because here | was on a war of my own, and which was not allowed, but | found out that he had been the guard in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Which made him subject to automatic arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Eisenhower had declared the so-called automatic arrest category and you as an American soldier could arrest anybody who was guilty of certain crimes, such as having been the guard at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . _</span><span class="sentence" id="211">| didn't tell him who | was until | finished the interrogation and | said, "Do you know who | am?" </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And he said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="213">| said, "My name is Schnaittacher." </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So he said, "But you should know how much | did for your Uncle." </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So | said, "Yes, indeed, | do know." </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And with that | turned him over to the CIC, who were less humane than | was and at least he was put away in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for some months. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The uniqueness of my war experience, | don't know whether, should we talk about that now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Let me ask you one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Did you Uncles, who were now in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> living with you, did they talk about their experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Did they explain what had happened, what it was like? </span><span class="sentence" id="221"><span class="BUILDING">Fritz Schnaittacher 13</span> [Date not labeled] Page 13
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They weren't beaten at that time, yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But there was totally inadequate food. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">No heating. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And inadequate dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">That is what is uppermost in my mind from what | remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">My Dad, keeping in mind your possible interest in our integration in American life, that this was also the period of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And most of us, of course, or all of us, were most sympathetic to the role of the Republican government in fighting Franco. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And certainly, ultimately, in fighting Mussolini and Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And we participated in the collection of funds to support the International Brigade and to render, I'm reluctant to say every possible support because we could have volunteered to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , which | didn't and very few of us did, if any. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Now of some significance to my life and the lives of my relatives and my mother, | had become involved in Uncle's business. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And of course it was my proud attempt to support as much as possible my mother, my grandmother, my Uncles and Aunts who didn't make a living of their own at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And ultimately they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And my mother kept <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And then | had to assume much greater responsibility because my Uncle died. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And so my brother and | became heirs, only to some degree because we had two cousins who, or three cousins, who shared in the estate in equal shares. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Then we became involved in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The company that | was with produced medical supplies, which were being used in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And most important | met the girl who ultimately | was going to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Her father shared <span class="INT_SPACE">office space</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And ata Christmas party, 1941, | recognized, and | told my mother, that that was the girl | was going to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And it was only two and a half months later, two months later, that we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And Fritz Schnaittacher 14 [Date not labeled] Page 14 yes, all the relatives raised their eyebrows and counted the days. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But nothing happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Was she also a refugee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Her father had emigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> around 1900. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Her mother was born here. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And then! </span><span class="sentence" id="250">was drafted in May of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And! </span><span class="sentence" id="252">went AWOL, do you know what that means? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">| went AWOL very early on when Dottie visited me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , and we spent the night together. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Then shortly after basic training, which | took in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cancroft</span> (ph), <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> , Dottie joined me with a small weekend release. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And it grew to the point where we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer truck</span> and a dog and we separated when | was flown over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , not to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , first to <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> , in July of 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  So you had been in training for about two years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Well the training, after basic training, | was transferred and Dottie joined me, to Florida, to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordinance Camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And then | applied for OCS and...
QUESTION:  OCS being?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Officers Candidate School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">From which | graduated in the spring of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And then there was an excess of officers so we were being trained in the cooks and bakers school and in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordinance Camp</span> , and we traveled from the <span class="REGION">East Coast</span> to the <span class="REGION">West Coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Until January or February of 1944, when Dottie's brother was killed as a Marine flyer, he was in training in carrier landings. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And | think that probably was February or March of 1944, or February. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And then | was sent to <span class="BUILDING">Intelligence Training Schools</span> and ultimately my main effort was the interrogation of prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So in July of 1944, Dottie and | separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">She went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and | Fritz Schnaittacher 15 [Date not labeled] Page 15 was flown to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> via <span class="REGION">Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And in order to participate in the landing in <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> on August 15, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And that's where | joined the 157" Regiment and my buddy, Fritzi, who was a Master Sargent, and | had a small intelligence team consisting of Fritzi and a Staff Sargent by the name of Al Magertle (ph), from the <span class="REGION">Middle West</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And after landing in <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> and moving quickly up to the vicinity of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borsch-Mums</span> (ph) where we arrived in early December or late November, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by the name of . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And we were stuck there until we started our offensive that was really thought to end the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And that was about March 15, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Now from then on, or within a week thereafter, there was hardly a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that was of significance to my family or myself, that we didn't conquer. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The first experience of this kind was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of Ah-shaf-en-berg (ph), which is about 100 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But the Aunt that | had mentioned earlier, she had originated from Ah-shaf-en-berg (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And | had attended her wedding in 1923 or 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And |, together with Fritzi, as interrogators, accepted the surrender of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And then had some unique experiences in bringing about the surrender of more German outfits by apprehending the fortress commander, putting him in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> , and wherever we went, he said, put your arms down. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">A unique little story was some days later, when we were approaching a beautiful, mid-evil <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bumberg</span> (ph), where | had four prisoners in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And one of them stepped out and said, "Lieutenant, didn't we go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together?" </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And | lifted his helmet, recognized him at once, and said, "Yes, Lesline (ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Lesline (ph) was hisname.
