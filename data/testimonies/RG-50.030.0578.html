ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  So, when — when and where did you enter the army”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I entered it Saint Joseph — well, actually at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leavenworth</span> , <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was inducted from Saint Joe, <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> and went into the army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leavenworth</span> , <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Was transferred from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leavenworth</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Hood</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And I was one of the first groups that their training period was reduced from 18 weeks to 12 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And we had 12 weeks of basic training, which really amounted to one day of looking at a weapon and being told what it was, the next day you would tear that weapon down, clean it and put it back together many, many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The next day you would spend a half a day in a schoolroom, showing videos of how that weapon was used in combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And then the next day you would go on a different weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And that’s the way it was for the 12 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And you learned to ha — you hadn’t night problems that you would use that weapon for a half a day, and then you were on a different type of a weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">At the end of, really the first week that we were there was just being assigned, getting our billets, getting our clothes, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So when it come right down to it, you only had 10 weeks of basic training, because the last week you were there, they were giving you orders to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and then to where you were to go from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So you — at the time I went through, you really only had 10 weeks of basic training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  And when were those dates in — when — when — when were those inclusive dates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  I we — I went in — in — on — on the — the first week in May, and the —
QUESTION:  Of year — year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Of 1944, and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for 10 days furlough. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Then I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Mead</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> and we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the — th-the — the first part of September of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And from there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , which took us 10 days to go across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> in a c — big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , we got off of one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , walked down the <span class="DLF">dock</span> , got on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and went across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I got off at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> on the 27" of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Went up on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> , which at that time was a replacement center. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They had two <span class="BUILDING">men tents</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And each t — and it rained every hour that we were on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> , and they would tell — they told us when we were assigned to our <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , there is a bulletin board right down here. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">You look at that bulletin board at least once every four hours because your name will appear and you will be deployed from here to some unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We had no idea where we were going to be deployed. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">On the second afternoon, they — we went to the bulletin board, and my name and elethe — and eleven other names were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin board</span> , and we were told to load on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> at 12 o’clock and at 12 o’clock we — 12 of us loaded on, and there was a sergeant on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He says, I will be in charge of you until you reach the deployment area where you’ll be assigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Six hours later we ended up at Pont A Mousson, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Moselle river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And the 80" — and when we got there, we actually unloaded on the west side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And a first sergeant by the name of Percy Smith came up, and he was just a small fellow, about five foot six, smoking a big stogie. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And he said, I want you fellows to know that you have just been assigned to Company G, of 317, the fightingest damned outfit in the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Well, maybe they all told us that, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But that was our approach when we first reached there. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Lined up, he got our names, our serial number, and he said, is there anyone here that has ever fired a 60 millimeter mortar? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And Ken Mauer(ph), who happened to have taken basic training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Hood</span> with me, was in the same group that I was in, which is a miracle for two people to be, but we were replacements. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">At that time we found out that the 80" had taken a lot of casualties, and that they needed replacements. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So Percy said, you see that bunch of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> about three blocks down there? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He said, there’s a sergeant by the name of Fadinas(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="39">You report to him, and he’s really gonna be glad to see you, because he lost five of his squad yesterday in an artillery barrage. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So, that was our re — first experience to being near combat situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And so we were assigned to the Company G, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dieulouard</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on the 29" or 30" of September of 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  I’m sorry sir, I should have asked straight away, what is your date of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  July 6", 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Thank you sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I’m sorry, carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  No —so, we went down and met Fadinas(ph), reported to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Turned out he was a Russian that had come over as a teenager, to get away from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And he had gotten his citizenship by volunteering to come into the United States Army when he was 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And at that time he was about 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And so, he was a very dedicated American soldier, but he hated the Germans with a passion, because his parents and his grandparents both had been eliminated by the SS in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What was your first experience, your first personal direct experience with combat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  My first personal experience was the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We were to take a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> on the east side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Moselle river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We had then, after we landed, we went across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Genevieve</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And Company G was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Genevieve</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and we were to take ov — a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish labor camp</span> that was supposed to be in some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , that were just beyond where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Well, as we started out, we started through these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and the Germans laid in an artillery barrage. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I can remember that Ken and I were so naive, that we were standing there and saying, oh look, that artillery shell hit that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and knocked the whole top out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Because we'd never seen anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And we were — were talking about how the shells were knocking the limbs off of these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , never thinking about that we could get hit ourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Well, after they k — shot about 12 shells, it seemed that the Germans would traverse to another <span class="REGION">area</span> , and our lieutenant said, c’mon fellows, let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Well, we got up and we started and we walked about 50 yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And here was the fellow laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> with the medics, and he had the top of his helmet and his head completely cut off with a piece of shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And I looked, and it was one of the fellows that rode up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Here’s a guy that just got into combat, didn’t even have his rifle off his shoulder, and was killed before we even got started. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Well, the next time that shells started exploding in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> around us, Ken and I were the first ones to stick our heads into the roots of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , because we didn’t want that to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And it was a very vivid experience of finding out what happens in combat, in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But we took that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> that day, and freed about 40 Polish labor — laborers out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that were providing labor for an electrical company in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pont A Mousson</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Do you recall the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  No, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I di — at that time I was so dumb, and so naive, that we didn’t know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">You know, thinking back to those days, compared to the army today, we were so dumb, and so naive compared to what the soldiers are today, because they’ve been trained, they’re professionals, they know what they’re doing, they know what their assignments are. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we didn’t even have an assignment before we came up that day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we were mortar men, and had had two days experience on a mortar before we came up to that 1 — to that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Do you ver — do you remember the condition of the Polish prisoners, were they well cared for, were they —
ANSWER:  No, they were — they were, as I remember, wearing very ragged clothes, dirty clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And that they were very skinny, and I would say that they were not well taken care of at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Did you communicate with any of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  No, no, we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  And, you said you were a mortar man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  I was a 60 millimeter mortar man. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Two days later —
QUESTION:  Hang — I’m sorry —
ANSWER:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION: —I’m sorry to interrupt you, I beg your pardon. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Did — did you establish what sort of work were the prisoners engaged in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  What kind — you — they were now — it was our understanding that they were working an <span class="BUILDING">electrical plant</span> in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pont A Mousson</span> , yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Was it — was it a hydro-electric, or was it coal driven, or —
ANSWER:  Oh, no you’re dri — it — 1t was one — there was no <span class="DLF">dams</span> or anything around there, so it had to be some kind of a — a — like oil driven, or motor — some kind of motors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Carry on, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, that — that day was our experience of — of going into — to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And so then we came back to the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Genevieve</span> , and we then were assigned, our next objective was to take a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and a <span class="DLF">road junction</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sivry</span> , which was about 10 miles east of the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we were at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Now, you understand that companies of infantrymen, one company will take an <span class="REGION">area</span> and go forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">There will be two companies that usually will go forward, and one company in reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That next day we were in reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">These other two companies had gone forward from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dieulouard</span> east into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And then we were brought up from reserve, and said your objective is to take this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sivry</span> , s-i-v-r-y, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">There is a <span class="DLF">road junction</span> there that the Ge-Germans are using that comes down from the mountains of s — of Saint — Saint Jane, and Saint Mihiel, and coming down and furnishing supplies to the Germans up around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So we want to cut that <span class="DLF">road</span> off. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We went into the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sivry</span> , set up our <span class="DLF">road blocks</span> , never had a fire — shot fired at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We went into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , dug our <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> , set up our defenses in our — our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At midnight that night, the Germans started firing from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Now, these are not <span class="ENV_FEATURES">peaks</span> , these are big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They had set up their artillery and mortars on top of these two big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> that overlooked this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> , and at midnight they started firing on Company G because we were the only ones in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And there’s about 75 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and a big <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">By daybreak there was not one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that was still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We went in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that day, short of our component of [indecipherable] we had 169 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they shelled us every time anybody would move outside of a <span class="DLF">foxhole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They let us dig in, the oth — that afternoon before, and never fired on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But that night they started firing on that <span class="DLF">field</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And by the next morning, all those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were completely flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And they kept firing all morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The afternoon fog moved in, and it began to get dark about 4:30 in the afternoon and we got notice to pull out. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Out of the 159, the daily report of Company G shows that 40 men walked out, and back up over the <span class="DLF">hill</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Now, I don’t know that all of them got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We know that about 38 of them got captured in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but the rest of them were injured, and that was — that was my first day of real combat, and you can become an experienced person of combat in a very short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Were you involved in the Battle of the Bulge as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">On — we were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Avold</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , near a little — in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gunwaller(ph</span> ), and we had just finished the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farebersviller</span> on November the 27", through the 29". </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And we had come up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Avold</span> , and were in reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we were there and we notice of a m — and about nine o’clock in the morning, there will be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> here at 12 o’clock to load us up, because we’re gonna take a trip up to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Well, nobody knew where the heck <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We didn’t — had never heard of it even. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so we, after — on the way up there, well, we got talking about it and trying to figure out what we were gonna do. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We had heard that the Germans had broke through up there, and that we were supposed to go up and support the troops that were up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Well, it’s about 125 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Avold</span> up to where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And that evening, or that night, we ended up just east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxembourg city</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gonderange</span> , between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gonderange</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Junglinster</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And the next morning we got notice, Company G was to be transferred, and we got in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and went up over — they call them <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , we call them big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> here — they went over the big <span class="DLF">hill</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steinsul(ph</span> ), a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steinsul(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steinsul(ph</span> ) we went to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">He wa — he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mersch</span> where headquarters company, but we were west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mersch</span> on the mountain west and going down the <span class="DLF">ridge</span> north towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ettelbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And we walked all evening, and up to about 10 o’clock at night, and we found a big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and it was sn — it was beginning to sleet. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And they put us up — we all got into that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and laid down and slept til the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But we could hear gunfire during the night, so we knew that we were getting close to the — the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But it was still about five miles north before we ran into any activity at all, which was just west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ettelbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And from there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niederfeulen</span> , and we were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niederfeulen</span> and then it began to snow and got cold as hell. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Cold as hell. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And the next day would have been the 234 — well, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niederfeulen</span> a couple a—a couple of days, and then we were supposed to go north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niederfeulen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourscheid</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walscheid</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kehmen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And as we went up the <span class="DLF">ridge</span> , and got just south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kehmen</span> , they opened fire on us, and we didn’t realize it, but they had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> to the east and north of that <span class="REGION">area</span> , that they could see the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> , it — it was like open <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to them, and they could see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And that was where what was called <span class="DLF">Bloody Ridge</span> , today, yet today to the Luxembourg people, because we were tied down there for two days, and took severe — 317 took severe casualties all that two days, because every time anybody got out of a <span class="DLF">foxhole</span> , they would get shot at, because they could see them from across the valley from that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> where they had their artillery and mortars dug in. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And that’s what most of it was, was shrapnel from artillery, and 1t would hit the frozen ground, and it would just skip, and hit people, if you were exposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And from there — we were there two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They drew us back, and then we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiderscheid(ph</span> ), and into — we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiderscheid(ph</span> ), and replaced — 319 had been in, that was another regiment of the 80", and they — they pulled out and moved farther west, towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> , and we then replaced them at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiderscheid(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And we got counterattacked that first night, and then we were able to save that. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And then our objective was to go across the — it’s the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">cliff river</span> in that <span class="REGION">area</span> that goes on down. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But from there, we were on the front side of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadler</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ringel</span> and all that <span class="REGION">area</span> , for almost two weeks, right in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , because they were across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> firing back at us, and <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , we couldn’t move. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We — every time we — we would move — plus the fact that supplies, we didn’t have supplies, and then on the 21% of January, we had — our objective was to start from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ringel</span> to go down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> and up over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourscheid</span> , and to help to take <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourscheid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I was in what was called the weapons platoon, the fourth platoon, and I had 26 men that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And Captain Namkowitz(ph), who was the company commander said, Myers, take your men and — and — and along with Heizer(ph) and his machine gun, you fellows walk up the — the <span class="DLF">fire alley</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , because, he said, you can carry your weapons, we don’t need you til you get to the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Well, we didn’t know it, but they had an 88 dug in up at the top, and there was 15 to 18 inches of snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and it was 18 below zero that morning, and — or that afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">As we walked up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> — now, out of my squad that — that day, of 12 men, I had nine men that had just come up, because they were new replacements, just — and I — I was an old man then, because I’d had from October, November, December, so I had 90 days of experience of — of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I was 26 years old, and everybody wanted to get into my squad because I was the oldest man there. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And they thought that because I was older that I was — I was — maybe could keep them safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Well, tha-that didn’t ha — that wasn’t the way it was in combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">You just were lucky wherever you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But anyway, I had young men, inexperienced, and as the 88 started firing down the <span class="DLF">firepath</span> at us, they started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We kept hollering, drop in the snow, drop in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Well, they didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They ran to get into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And the Germans had wire traps all up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , with bouncing Betty booby traps that were half gallon bucket size, s-syrup bucket size, that would jump 40 inches in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and explode, and they were filled with shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And they were devastating. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Well, when we started to run, Heizer(ph) and I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> in the center of the <span class="DLF">firepath</span> , in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They were running, they hit these, and out of the 26 men, 22 of them got — were casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And that afternoon, that — after that afternoon, four o’clock they called off the — the advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">About the fi — si — third or fourth shell that that 88 fired, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> started firing at that 88 and finally knocked it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But that was — we only had about four or five shells from that 88, and that was all because they knocked it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But that evening, there were so many casualties in G Company, that that evening, not only in G Company, but in the second battalion going up that <span class="DLF">hill</span> , that when they called it off, they’ve all had — called for volunteers of 22 men from the company, and two officers to carry the casualties to — back towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ringel</span> , so they could be put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> to be taken back to the first aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And that day, after that day, gi— G Company had less than 50 men in — in it that day, and we were attached then for three more days to another company, because we were declared inoperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So, until we could get more replacements up, why, we were attached to another company and that — that was one day that you don’t forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  After — 1-1t seems to me that in an extraordinarily compressed period of time, you experienced a tremendous amount of combat, and saw a lot of losses and a lot of men killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">At that point, did that experience change the way that you felt about the war, and your role in it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Well, I went to Captain Namkowitz(ph), and I said, Captain, I had — by that time I had a squad of six men, myself, and then the other sergeant, Sergeant Magarlick(ph) had six men. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We had lost so many men I went to Captain Namkowitz(ph) and I said, I think that I’m bad luck, and that I hadn’t b — outta be a squad leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He said, Myers, he said, it’s not your fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He said, work with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He said, you’ve got more experience than anybody else around here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He said, don’t do this to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And so that’s — that’s the only reason I stayed, was because he — he asked me to, and he talked me out of it, because I really felt that I was bad luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Did you, as you were advancing, come across any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  No, not in that <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  When — after you moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> and what have you, wh-what was your first experience o-of coming across a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  The first experience, of course, was — was, for me was not until we got clear to boo — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  And when was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Da-Datewise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  And that was April the 12", the morning of April — when — when Company G, and the 80" division came up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , and the 319" came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> and they sent a message to the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , surrender the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , or we will attack it with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and artillery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Yeah, 319 was armor, was it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  No, 319 was another — was another regiment of the 80" division.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Okay, so it was infantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  It was infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And they came up and all of us, each regiment had an armored unit attached to it, like the 307. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Three — 307 tank battalion was attached to the second battalion of 317. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But three wee — actually, 317 as we came — we had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> for three days fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And then we started and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , and it’s only 10 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , why 319 was ahead of us, and 317 was in reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They call it reserve, we were held — we were all like a mile back of them, so that if they got in trouble, why we could be deployed up to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But we stopped and we sat there for — for quite a — for about three or four hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And finally, why they gave the message to the mayor to surrender the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and he and a lady on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> came out with a white flag, and they surrendered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So, 319 went around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , 317, with the second battalion, came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> and we were the only ones that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> from the 80" division actually, because 319 skirted it and went around, and 318 followed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">317 was left in reserve so that we could — our — ou-our assignment was to do police work and keep control of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And that’s what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">317, the three — the second battalion walked right down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> from the west, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">As we walked down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we were on both sides of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , about five, 10 yards apart, each one of us, as we got downtown, the civilians that were on the <span class="DLF">street</span> as we walked by, would turn their back to us and face the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and wouldn’t look at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Wouldn’t look at us at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But the kids, the kids would run out and say, have you got any gumy(ph), gumy(ph), gumy(ph) chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And so they were just like kids back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And when we got <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , we went down to the <span class="DLF">plaza</span> that is right in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , and company G, Captain Namkowitz(ph) set his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> up in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> right down on the — on the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So he signed all the different ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I had to s-set up on a <span class="DLF">street</span> with my mortars, near the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , so that I could see down the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , in case that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> come, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So, we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We kept seeing these people who were in striped suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Not many, but we would see them once in awhile, walk by. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Finally Captain Namkowitz(ph) told Percy Smith, who was the first sergeant of G Company, he said, Percy, he says, you take down Smith the Jeep driver in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and get Myers, and you guys go see if you can find out where the hell these guys are coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He said, wa — where are they coming from? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He said, we’d see — they must be a — a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , or a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> around here that they’re getting out of. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So, we started, and we asked four different civilians, where are these prisoners? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Nix(ph), nixt(ph), we don’t know, we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They didn’t know where they were coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Well, we went down to the railroad st — <span class="DLF">track</span> , or down by the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and saw two boys that were about 10 - 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Percy could speak a little bit of German, and Percy got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and he went over to these boys, he said, where are these prisoners coming from? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And they said, oh, way out on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , way up on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , way out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So, we started to drive out in that direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We drove for about four miles, and we thi — and we got to talking, we said, you know, those damn kids, they — they’ve given us bad direction, there can’t be anything out here, and we still didn’t see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But we were on a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> that had been traveled a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So, Don said, well, we’ll just follow this up around the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So we went up around the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and then right at the top of this <span class="DLF">hill</span> , here was a 10 foot <span class="DLF">wire fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Guys were just leaning against it, just looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We drove up to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and we didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We saw all these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Now, at the wi — at that time, we didn’t realize that we were at the <span class="DLF">back gate</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , which was down by where the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> all around that <span class="REGION">area</span> on the west side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and we came up on the west side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And Percy got out and he asked the guy, he said, what is this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , anyway? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And the guy says, ein minute, ein minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He goes into a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and comes out with a little fellow that was five foot six. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Skinny? </span><span class="sentence" id="234">God, he didn’t weigh 70 pounds, he didn’t weigh 60 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">He said, my name 1s so and so, and I am from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He said, I’ve been in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He could speak English, very good English. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He said, I been in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for four years, and he said, this is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Percy said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , what the hell is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He said, well, we furnish — he said, they come here and this 1s a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">He said, there’s other little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> all around, at the industries and out 1n the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , that furnish labor from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And he said — Percy said, well, who’s in charge here? </span><span class="sentence" id="243">He said, well, the SSers were until last night, and they heard that you were headed this way, and, he said, they ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He said, there was about 3,000 of them here. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We said, 3,000? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And he said yes, he said, there was approximately 3,000 here before you came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He said, how many people are in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , anyway? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Well, we could see — now, where we came in, there were low one, just one story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that looked like they had been put up in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They had just — I don’t know whether it was straw board, or what, but it wasn’t — it — 1t was — looked like temporary <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And so he said, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> here, is — is the west part — he said, the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> is over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Well, we didn’t know that there was a name — main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And later on, we found out that other people from 317 had come in on the front side of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But he said, there was some guys here yesterday in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorized vehicle</span> , kind of like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , but he said, they didn’t even come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They just were here for a short time, and he said, they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And we said, well, what did you have to — what are you eating? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And he said, well, he said, the SSers had some potato peelings that they had peeled yesterday and threw in the <span class="DLF">dump</span> , and he said, we got them and washed them, and then, he said, we went over there and got green grass and brought over and put in with that, and he said, that’s all we’ve had to eat today. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So, we went inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , just to the first row of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they had people laying out, and Percy says, what happened to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Oh, they just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And about that time, here come six guys pulling a two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> up from around the corner, down below. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And they were picking these dead guys up and putting them on this two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I don’t know what they were doing with them when they got them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">But Percy said, well, I don’t remember was Percy, me or Don said, what do they do with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Well, he says, they have a <span class="BUILDING">cremator</span> — had — they have an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">An <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Yeah, he said, they burn them. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He said, they burn the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Well, come find out they had two <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span> there with four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> in each <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and they worked them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And — so Percy said, how many people are here? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He said, well, we think there is about 26,000 here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And Percy said, who’s in charge? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Well, we have a committee that’s in charge, but, he said, really nobody’s in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He said, a bunch of them took off after the SSers. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He said, they broke into the armament, and they are after the SSers now. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And he said, we’ve got ninet — now I’m —I-—I might be wrong, but he said — I think that he said, we have 19 of them locked up on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And so Percy and I and Don went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and Captain Namkowitz(ph), we told him what we’d found. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He said, well, I’m going to call division and tell them what’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So they said, well, we’ll have some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with some food and blankets and medicine up there tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So, I was assigned with my five man — six man, I was assigned from the 13", the 14" and up until about noon on the 15" to go around and pick up these guys that were in — s- straggling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and to take them back out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for — so that they could get medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And some of the fellows didn’t want to go back out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But we told them that they were gonna be food out there, the best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Tried to tell them, but we had one fellow that was at the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and he came out of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> eating a potato that must have weighed a pound. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And he was just eating that thing just like 1t was a candy bar. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He walked out to — almost to where our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">je</span> — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and he fell over. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Well, we picked him up, put him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and took him back out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and Dr. Bob out there, he was our battalion medic, he was out there and by that time they had set up some medics also that had got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And he said, this poor guy, he didn’t weigh 60 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He said, this poor guy was e — we told him what happened, and he said, well, probably the starch in the potato was just too much for his system and he just can’t handle it, he just couldn't handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So, on the 15", then, I was r — they — I was relieved by — now, I — I think it was people — fellows from a cavalry that replaced us, but by that time then, our headquarter, our <span class="BUILDING">company headquarters</span> had moved, and we went to Gina(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Gina(ph) was east of there, and so we went to Gina(ph) from — from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  When you said you su — you supplied them with blankets and medicine and — and food and what have you, what sort of food did you provide? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Were they K rations, was it [indecipherable] what was it?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Now, they told us that there were subcamps all around, that they furnished labor out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Now, part of our 319 came by a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orndorf(ph</span> ), which was to the west of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And this year we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orndorf(ph</span> ) and course all it is there is the same way at — at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , is just where the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were, and a monument that they have there in a couple <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But at that time, it was a <span class="DLF">hellhole</span> , because they didn’t treat them as nice as they treated them even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , which it was horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  Having seen what you saw in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , did it alter your view of th — of the war, and your role in it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Not really, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Because I didn’t — w-we were in the infantry in the line companies, and we weren’t in <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and such as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So, w-we only got <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that had been assigned to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We weren’t in the job of taking <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , or taking — making our own assignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But I would say that this time, at the banquet, the prime minister of [indecipherable] looked at we five guys that were there, and he sa — when he started talking, he said, I want to thank you for freeing the German people from the tyranny of the Nazi political regime, because he said, we were prisoners and didn’t realize it as well as these people here at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I thought that was quite a statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And — but it proves what can happen to politicians when they get too much power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  When you first came across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , did you have any idea what you were looking at? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Di — wa — wou — had you heard stories, had you heard reports about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , or was — did it completely take you by surprise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  Well, this took us by surprise, because we had heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but we didn’t really know what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We hadn’t seen any — I hadn’t seen any pictures of any, and I didn’t know that they were as big as what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was, damn, that covered 400 acres. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And the — the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were there, there were three story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , there were two story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and then there were a lot of these pre — kind of <span class="BUILDING">prefab buildings</span> around the <span class="REGION">west side</span> , the edge there, where we came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And that, I couldn’t — ’'d — I was amazed, really, because I’d — I didn’t realize that — that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , what the heck they were doing with that many people for a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , you know”?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Well, yes, because I gave them to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">At the — we were — we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> up until November, then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when they had an election of — in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Then we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schongau</span> , and at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schongau</span> we were there probably — I said November, it was October when we went to — to czechosl — or to — yeah, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And then we came back <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schongau</span> for a month, then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aufschaffensburg(ph</span> ), <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which at that time was a deployment point. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And our job was that they would send in G.L.s from all over Europe into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aufschaffensburg(ph</span> ) and each morning I would get orders — well, when they would come in, I would get their orders, that they would — the name, and how many points they had, and their number. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And then I would get each morning, an order, today you have to ship out so many people to f— to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but they have to have so many points. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So I would go through the rosters, and pick out the — the rest of the guys were doing nothing, actually, ther — that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But we knew that we were gonna get to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> pretty soon, so then I got orders that the 80" division was to move <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on about the 29" of December, I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So, we were replaced by another outfit that took over our job, and we then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaHavre</span> and got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  What was that like, what was coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Well, we got into one hell of a storm by the Azores. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And the captain of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> said, I’ve been a captain of — in the navy for 31 years, and have never seen waves in the <span class="DLF">English channel</span> like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> would go up and come down and hunks of enamel or paint would pop off of the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Guys in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> — they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> five high, you know, wrapped with rope and the ropes would actually break and the guys would fall, and everybody was seasick, my God, everybody was seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And he said, I’ve never seen waves like this in my 31 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I thought, my God, I was in combat 210 days and I’m going to go drown going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">That’s what I thought, I really did, but boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But after five days it — it began to smooth out. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and set outside of <span class="DLF">New York harbor</span> for four hours in the dark and we couldn’t figure out why. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Well, they waited until daybreak to take us by the Statue of lemer — of Liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And man, everybody — everybody was crying and f— happy and hollering and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And hello statue, and they all laughed, and it was — it was a very happy time. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And then they unloaded us at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , took us over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> they took us into a big <span class="BUILDING">assembly hall</span> , the first thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">When we got off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we marched into there. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">When we got in there, on the <span class="DLF">stage</span> was a big American flag, and they had a — a big fan in back of that flag, and it was just a flopping, and they were playing the national anthem. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And I can still do — I can still think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">That — that was a very emotional, it even is yet today, I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  What was seeing your family like, again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Well, my wife met me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I was deployed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Louis</span> , and — to get discharged, and was supposed to meet her at a certain <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I got there, she wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They — for after, I’d said to the clerk, and I went back about three different times, and I said, she has to be here, because this is where we were to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And they said, well, wait just a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they went over and they looked through the thing, and they said, oh, we didn’t have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We had to put her up into a —a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in the east — the west part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And so I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and went ... and it was — it was a joy, because I hadn’t seen her for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I hadn’t really had anything except just a letter, because you don’t — you didn’t have computers or cell phones, or anything like that today. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I can’t believe how the guys talk <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every day, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And it was — it was — we were married 70 years and I lost her last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But I have lot of wonderful, wonderful, wonderful memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  Sir, this interview is for posterity. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">What would you most like future generations to know about your experiences? </span><span class="sentence" id="391">What would you most like them to learn?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Never to let their damn politicians get enough power that they think that they are the boss, instead of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And that worries me right now, because there isn’t anyone listening to anyone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And this has to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I talked to a lot of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ’s history classes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , I’m — I happen to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">About — I never talked very much about my experiences until about 15 years ago, and my granddaughter said, Grandpa, will you come to our history c — and tell us about World War II? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I said, what can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="398">She said, well — I said, why don’t you have your history teacher write me down some things that she would like for me to cover? </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And so from that, I talked to her class and told them — and then I opened it up and — for questions, and let them ask me questions about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And from that I started. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And the year before my wife got sick, and I had to kind of quit this for awhile, I talked to 46 different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in one year, about World War II, and the Battle of the Bulge, and this, and I bring it up to them, that if your parents aren’t voting, then you keep on them, and make sure that they vote for someone, and to study their — what they stand for before you let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And don’t let them say, well, I don’t have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Because they do have time, and it’s their duty to you to see that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> stays like it has been down through the centuries, up until this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Because this is the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world like us, and we don’t want it to be changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And so, I’ve — I feel — and I’ve been doing this now for almost 15 years, and Ill probably get back into it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  I hope you do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  Any closing words, sir?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We thank you, and I think what you have done here in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> 1s something that, it — it — 1t has been needed, and the people need — more people need to see what happened, so that they won’t let it happen here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because it can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">It can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">You know, the German people, the only reason it happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was because Hitler was such a charismic speaker that he convinced people that he knew more than what they did, and that he was — his group of people were smarter than what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And that he had the answers to bring <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> back from 40 percent unemployment to what it was back before World War I. They fell for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And the Senate rescinded their authority and let him have a one man decision on all questions, problems and answers to what he thinks that ger — is best for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The first thing he did, so the people tell me, was after he got this authority, was to eliminate everyone that disagreed with him, by building up hate within the people for a specific problem that Hitler wanted to get rid of. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">That was religion, God, and his enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And he was successful in getting the Senate to relinquish their power and to give it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But in the new constitution of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they no longer have that authority to relinquish that power to one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It must stay in a vote in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So I was told in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> this time, because I ask them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  Thank you Mr. Myers. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Thank you for your interview.</span></p>
