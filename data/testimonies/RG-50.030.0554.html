<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  So, after the war started, what ha — what had happened to your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Did they try to escape <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , or —
ANSWER:  No, when my mother — my mother — my mother before the war was always advising to leave to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , because a cous — my ma — my — my — my grandma cousin, first cousin was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buenos Aires</span> and did well. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So sa — always like a possibility which my mother always considered in

class="sentence" id="64">They thought the war — nothing will happens, you know, so he was optimistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So they never fled away. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And once was the war start, like everybody else, we — we have to move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And the reason why my mom were not ta-taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three survivors, is because we didn’t live in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my grandmothers live and the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And me — my — my father, the older men of the family, he — he was there with — with the rest when they close and they ah — they emptied the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and took everybody away. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So, my mom was — when she said well — she wa — she November 8, 2008 didn’t — she didn’t have any doubts that this is not for taking her to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> , that was for extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So she says, I am not waiting here for — for death, I am — I am running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">If I will be caught on the — on the run, at least I tried to do something for my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So she — you know, was corruption, like everywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So she — she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to supply us with documents, aray — Aryan documents on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They — they didn’t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, my mother was waiting and that took her a little bit more than she — sh-she — es — expect to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So she was very am — you know, nervous and watching if the people are coming and bringing the document. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then sh-she showed me the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Gestapo car</span> coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So from the — from the back of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we run away, just in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So s — as — close calls like this, we had a couple of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Even when we was trying to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after the war, where the — the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So, in order to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to the <span class="REGION">western Germany</span> was a ri — also risking a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But coming back to those times — so we — we left — we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and my mother remember from her young age that her

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> on the bank of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wista river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And so sh — in order to run from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , she went there with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And that was a mistake, because in a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , ou-ou-outside there is November 8, 2008 noticeable immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So, very, very short time after, we were on our way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And of course those — those voyages cost money, and we — we didn’t have too man — too much of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So shortly after bri — getting back to

class="BUILDING">school</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">elemental school</span> , a Christian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And she says, well, if you refuse to help me, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It’s a big risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But 1f you can’t, I have no one to call any more, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So — and she, she did so. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She said, wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She hold us all the day there until the fire — the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to him by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And he comes convince by her — his wife, to help us. </span><span class="sentence"
