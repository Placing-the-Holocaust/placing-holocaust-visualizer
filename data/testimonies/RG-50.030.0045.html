<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">Harlem Hospital</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Well, my folks were from, uh, the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh, my mother came from the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug River</span> and and my father was on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> and, uh, they were childhood friends and they immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at different times and met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and my father was in World War I and, uh, in the infantry which, uh, I was quite proud of as you'll find out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And, uh, he bought a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and we shortly moved to <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , that is the father and mother, and, uh, when my mother was pregnant with me she went to a lying-in hospital which happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad train</span> went right through our <span class="DLF">farm</span> , stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and picked her up and delivered her to <span class="BUILDING">Pennsylvania Station</span> and she took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  There was no such facilities in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Um, tell me then a little bit...you grew up in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Then we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for a couple of years and I got to be a, uh, street bum and, uh, kids learned how to smoke cigarettes and rammed around and got into gang fights and the usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And, uh, at, uh, age ten we moved back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> because of the Depression and we were on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> until I was inducted into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I became a carpenter before I went in the Army, and that's why I was in the engineer... in the engineers. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We had, uh, uh, I had the background for it, having built <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and <span class="BUILDING">movie theaters</span> and different structures, <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and so on in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> before I went in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And in the Army I picked up on that and learned a lot of new things. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Learned how to blow up the things that I had built, and which was a terrible thing in my mind--when we had to destroy <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and even <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> which we blew down occasionally to, uh, to make the war effort a little more, uh, well, not useful but to learn what we had to do in service, in combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And it stood us in good stead stead because the things we learned were, uh, important to the Army and nobody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh, tell me about when you uh, what were the circumstances in which you were taken overseas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Well, we went, we [were] inducted in the Army, in the Armed Forces, in 1942, uh, late in '42, in November, and we maneuvered in <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> and <span class="REGION">Texas</span> for approximately a year, uh, a little over a year, and, uh, we, uh, then went to <span class="REGION">Texas</span> and the plains of dry, plains of <span class="REGION">Texas</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abilene</span> , at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Barkley</span> and then we went to the <span class="DLF">desert</span> to get desert training at Patton's <span class="BUILDING">desert training center</span> , which is now a national monument. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And in those days it was bleak, dreary, miles of endless wastes, and typical of <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> where we thought we might go. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">However that war ended before we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So we trained in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> until September of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And then we shipped from <span class="REGION">California</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> ; and from there to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , because the 12th Armored Division had taken our equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We were landed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> instead of directly in on the continent. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Then from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> we got trans-shipped to the continent. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And we landed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> , and we started to track east towards the, uh, <span class="REGION">fighting front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And about the time we got there--December 16th, 1944--is when the Battle of the Bulge started. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So we were thrown into the Battle of the Bulge, and that was our first baptismal of fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And, uh, first couple of days we lost hundreds and hundreds of men, wounded and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Approximately 300 killed and a couple of thousand wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And, uh, from there we went to the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> after crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> , and we traveled across Europe, uh, like vagabonds, thirty miles at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We'd stop and wait for the rest of the infantry to catch up. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We were in an armored division which would go thirty miles in a day easily whereas an infantry division were lucky to go three or four miles in a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So we were always ahead of our, uh, support units. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We had infantry in our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> , which defended the people who were, uh, in spear-heading as we called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And, uh, we travelled across Europe, uh, for, uh, weeks at a time and towards the end of the war was just a continual pack, pick-up, pack-up, dig-in, pack-up and go, go, go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Was the fighting very heavy at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Uh, well, we had a lot of pockets of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The German people, the Volksturm and the SS would drive the local farmers into shooting at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">If they didn't shoot at us, they would shoot the farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And they made feeble attempts at trying to shoot us naturally and the SS, uh, troops kept moving back in towards the interior of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and, uh, the, well, you know, this went on a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I'm trying to talk here in a few minutes and describe, uh, uh, a couple of months of activity--it's very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The, uh, thing that I remember was we started to see our men being killed and because of our men being killed, a couple here and a couple there, we would kill whole squads of Germans the way they mowed down the, uh, prisoners and, uh, their opponents. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And sometimes the <span class="DLF">hillsides</span> would be covered with bodies of the Americans, or a <span class="DLF">hillside</span> would be covered with the bodies of the Germans, and then later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates or, uh, slaves on <span class="DLF">farms</span> , they would, uh, march them ahead of them trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these people apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And uh....
QUESTION:  Did you see any of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">These bodies were lying along the <span class="DLF">roadsides</span> where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they were shot because they weren't going fast enough and, uh, it was a terrible thing but, uh, it was practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">From April 15th to the end of the war we saw this in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> and, uh, uh, the, uh....
QUESTION:  Was that your first contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Was, was in April, about the 15th of April, yeah, we started to see the where they had been marched ahead of us because, uh, in because of the nature of the spear-heading, the 11th Armored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap, this is the 11th Armored Division, and I was in the 56th Engineers, and that's this little insignia right here which is our uniform insignia. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And the 11th Armored patch was ordinarily worn on your shoulder and, uh, there there were several armored divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We were one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The 4th Armored was a sister division, and we were leap-frogging ahead, uh, in spurts as it were until and then we'd rest for a day or two until the infantry caught up to, to, uh, contain the <span class="REGION">lands</span> that we had just over-run. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And that's when we would see these prisoners who had been walking ahead of us for a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We'd catch up to them and we'd see the ones who had been, uh, uh, had died along the <span class="DLF">roadsides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And by the hundreds in some cases, and then just here and there and then they tried to bury some and they were, made half-hearted attempts because they took too much time to bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They were trying to hide the, the ones that had died and then there were so many of them they just left them after a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  All right, tell me if you would where you were as you were about to approach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">How did you get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, uh, we were in a combat command. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And Combat Command A is the one I was in ordinarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Uh, we were down in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We were, we forked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">A combat command, one would go to the left, one would go to the rnght and sometimes a third combat command called "CCR," or "Reserve," would take a central point. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And there would be three prongs of us armored, uh, divisions spanning out and covering as much <span class="REGION">territory</span> as we could; and taking it in and and opposing and and mowing down the opposition with our heavy guns, our 75, uh, millimeter guns and three-inch guns on, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank destroyers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And, uh, we kept going and going and until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">That was CCA, but CCB went, uh, to the north of us...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">What is CCB...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Combat Command B. There are three combat commands in an armored division - Combat Command A, which is, uh, composed of select troops depending on a situation from the main body of the division which of 11,000 men, and, uh, CCB would be another group of men, engineers and tank destroyers, uh, or artillery depending on what we thought we needed, medical men and of course supplies always brought up the rear, following the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> -they called it <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">division train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then CCR was a reserve command of troops ready to go to the aid of CCB or CCA whichever was needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">In most cases they were always in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But when needed, they would be shifted to the front, or to relieve the pressure of one group that was in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">For instance, CCA was stuck in the, uh, certain section of <span class="DLF">Siegfred line</span> for a couple of days and couldn't get through and had some casualties, so they took them back and CCR replaced them. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">That's the, that's the, there's three parts--they call it a triangular division, and those are the three parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  So you were moving toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ....
ANSWER:  Right, and CCB, uh, were the ones that found the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They, uh, the doctor--that's, uh, Doormeyer (ph), I believe it was, he had gotten a Red Cross, uh, official and they came down the <span class="DLF">road</span> and with a Red Cross flag flying on their, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volkswagen</span> , and, uh, our men spotted it and the one fellow, uh, Sergeant Albert, uh, J. Kosiek,’ uh, was able to speak Polish and so did the doctor that was in this, uh, uh, vehic..uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volkswagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And, uh, he said, "We have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They're ready to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We want you to come and take the...the Germans prisoner.” </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And they came down to meet us; so they took us right to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And, uh, the fellows were greeted with cheers and the SS troops had already evacuated because they knew what was going to happen to them, and they only left the ordinary German soldiers there who were guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And these, uh, German soldiers, uh, had of course thrown all their weapons in and now the people had them. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And they were ready to shoot all the soldiers, but, uh, we kept them from doing that and, uh, but they did hang some of the worst, uh, guards, some of the ones that had treated them the worst--the, they took care of them before we got there actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They were hanging on the <span class="DLF">fences</span> , uh, butchered and, uh, desecrated; it's no worse than what they had done except here you saw an able-bodied man now hanging on an <span class="DLF">electric fence</span> and, uh, cut apart and they they were paying back a little bit you know of what they had gotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Let's back up a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">You are about, you are approaching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You have your your doctor in front of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Yeah, this doctor went, went, uh, took us right up to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and right to the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> and, uh....
QUESTION:  Describe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Describe entering the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Tell me exactly what you saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Well, uh, let let me put this, uh, let me get you straight on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I had gone with CCA to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> Officially, Staff Sargeant Albert J. Kosiek. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Platoon leader of First Platoon, Troop D, 41st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">and we had, uh, taken over two tons of dynamite off the <span class="DLF">Adolph Hitler Bridge</span> , my squad and I, because we don't want nobody else there because if, if there was booby trap we overlooked, it would have blown the whole <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and ourselves to bits. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Meantime this was going on at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I'm telling you what Albert Kosiack told us, when we went back in 1975 and he had, we had, uh, we went over by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and we went, we were together for a week or so, and we talked this thing over and, uh, I feel as if I were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And, uh, well the people just hugged them fellows; they just, they--it was indescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They were so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They were screaming and they were trying to touch them and, uh, fellows and, uh, he said he'll never forget it and of course the doctor who was, uh, who could speak Polish was, was, the doctor told, uh, Kosiack told the doctor to have the people who now had the German machine guns and everything to please stack them up and, uh, we'll take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So they set fire to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So that the people wouldn't have the guns because they would be going down in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> shooting everybody, so to keep them from doing that, they stacked all the guns and then they set fire to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But the, by the time we got near, the people knew the war was over because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and radios, they had, somebody had a radio--they had one radio in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> and they knew the war was almost over. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It wasn't over until the 8th. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We got there on May 5th, three days before the war was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  When did you physically get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> about May 10th, when they called for the engineers to come with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was in the engineers as I explained before, and my friend Al Salzman (ph) from <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> was a bulldozer operator so, uh, I was helping him and, uh, taking movies and black and white pictures, slides. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I had all the film I needed because, you may think this 1s funny, but I had a lot of girlfriends and these girls were sending me film from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I had all the movies that I took pictures everyday of combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">When I wasn't being shot at I was shooting with movie film and with, uh, black and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I have hundreds and hundreds of feet of movie film which unfortunately didn't all get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was x-rayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was, uh, lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It was stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">One, one, in one timea__—_—s went night through my knapsack full of Battle of the Bulge pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The 35 millimeters, most of mine was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Let's let's get back, we're back from the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Well, I'm just trying to tell you why I got the film in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I had all film and I'm sorry I don't have all of the film that I did take. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But anyway ....
QUESTION:  I want to see, for the purpose of this tape, I need to ask you if you would to describe the scene at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> when you, Ray Buch, first went through those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We came up through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and, uh, it's on a steep <span class="DLF">hillside</span> , on the top of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> is, uh, next to 1t which is below them and part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> sets on, if they keep on quarrying there the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> will fall down into the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Uh, as we approached it looked like a hugh <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> which we have back in the States. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And that's exactly what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">However, inside the <span class="DLF">prison walls</span> and in back of them were, uh, compounds consisting of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , which held a couple of hundred people and these were in the main part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> on the top part and here we saw double <span class="DLF">electrified fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Uh, uh, people were by this time sunning themselves, and a lot of people were nude because they had no clothes: they had been worn off or torn off by those who were stronger and, uh, people were walking around nude because they didn't have enough clothes at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Uh, we had, uh, as I said there were other visitors coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In fact I think the Russians came one of the days and they of course they started then to bring troops in from the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , from the <span class="REGION">American side</span> , (cough) excuse me, and from the German civilians nearby we started to get those people to come up by the truckload and we told them to dress in their Sunday best, and then we made them dig <span class="DLF">graves</span> , and, uh, we wanted them to see what was going on and then we had them carry the bodies, load the bodies in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We took wagonload after wagonload of bodies out to the <span class="DLF">grave site</span> , which was the <span class="DLF">soccer field</span> or the sport, uh, they call it the <span class="DLF">Sportplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And, uh, we made the Germans handle, load them up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> from inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> take them down to the the, uh, <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> , the <span class="DLF">grave site</span> , and unload them, put them down in the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , side by side, by the hundreds--would be a hundred and fifty people or so in a row--and side, practically on top of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They were such, they were all skin and bones and it was--I have pictures of them and movies which you'll see later, but the, uh, uh, bodies were so emaciated that that you you couldn't possibly understand how those people were alive and walking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And, uh, some of those walking around looked better than the dead, of course, a little better than the dead and some of them looked worse, and they're still alive depending on their resistance or whatever--I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But it was incredible that they were still walking in many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The walking dead we called them at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  What was the reaction of the German civilians to having to bury the dead? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">What did they . . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">9
ANSWER:  They, they all they just shook their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They said, No, nein, nein--we didn't know--we knew they were a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,"</span> but they didn't realize what was happening to all the people because they had, uh, a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> with a railroad--they ran, uh, stone out you know on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> down below. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">On a lower level there was a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , uh, the quarry stone out to different building projects throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Went to the main railroad, down along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And, uh, they didn't realize that the there would be carloads of, uh, uh, clothing going out from all these people, would be going out by the carloads to be reprocessed into new blankets and German Army uniforms or whatever, uh, from the people who had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And they didn't incinerate any of the clothing the clothing because, uh, it was bad enough burning up the bodies that they burned, and, uh, the German people were were, knew there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They knew people was going to it but I don't thing they knew how bad it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It's a similar situation in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> --now we have newspaper reporters that get in and we tear our jails apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We know what's going on because we're an open free public, but under a dictatorship, I believe that most of those people did not know and they acted as if they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Of course we did too. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I can cry right now thinking about how terrible it was and, uh, I had an empathy for them because, uh, I was of German descent. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">My parents spoke German and, uh, but however they didn't teach it to me because it was taboo in World War I and I knew my English and only knew a few words, mostly cuss words in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">When my father would get mad, he would say, . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Uh, that, that's my imperfect German but that's what about the extent of my German. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">However I picked it up over there and I was able to interview a couple of the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I picked on girls because they were pretty as, as you, as I said before; I don't know why but the these girls always did me favors and this one girl said that she had been marched ahead of the German troops from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> and coll... and the story confirms what I had said earlier about marching them from the ea..<span class="REGION">western front</span> towards the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> towards the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they had marched all these thousands of people in, uh, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> from various camps around the east and west and this one girl was, uh, been marched for about a week she said ahead of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">She says better to with the Germans than the Russians, because they were raping the girls and the women and it was pathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We had a <span class="DLF">line</span> of demarcation, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Steyr River</span> ; the Russians on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the Americans on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And it was bedlam over there - screaming and killing and shooting and tearing the <span class="NPIP">place</span> apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They [the Russians] would send the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and the sink...the running water, they, forgetting that they needed running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And they were just a bunch of wild animals, the Russian soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Let's come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You have started to bury the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Uh, were you involved at all in helping to get the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> organized? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">What, what was done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the doctors started coming in and they had already had, uh, uh, experience April 15th, uh, out in, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It was one of the biggest ones we overran, which was around April 15th. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So by the 5th of May when we got there, and a couple of days later when the engineers got there to, to start digging <span class="DLF">trenches</span> to bury the dead, uh, they were pretty much, uh, they pretty well knew what they had to do to help these people, so we rushed in supplies and, uh, emergency supplies from, uh, the Army medical, uh, supplies and surplus, uh, Army uniforms and, uh, the, uh, various <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> around that the Germans had or the Austrians had were utilized to supply foo. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We raided those in other words, and we, the civilian population had, was, had to go without. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">In fact that winter, the following winter, they a lot of them almost starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Uh, but we were trying to to feed these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And, uh, our division set up the, uh...and Colonel Seibel was in command, and he was 1n command of CCB at the time as I mentioned earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And he directed the, uh, uh ...the proceedings, that is, uh, the cleaning up of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the burning of this and burning of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Some of the clothes and things that we, were burned up and old, uh, latrines--uh, they were filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Uh, we tried to get rid of some of the things that were contagious that would spread germs and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So the people themselves were still dying because they were beyond help. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We got there too late and they died daily, uh, by the hundreds the first few days and then they tapered off and there was a few, maybe a dozen a day, uh, thirty days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But, uh, we were there for about thirty days, our division, and then the 26th Infantry Division took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">In fact, some of those came in early so they could see how we were doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Our men stood guard to keep the, uh, people under control because some of the, the Russian prisoners were very aggressive anduh....
QUESTION:  What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Well, they they wanted to shoot every German that came in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> because they had been, uh, put in, incarcerated 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they were skin and bones and they, they were ready to tear them apart with their bare hands, so we had to have our men walking around with guns to keep everything, keep the keep these people from uh killing each other or killing their former, uh, masters so called.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  What was your role in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Well, I was, uh, an engineer and and as I said our, my project was to, uh, help bury the dead because my buddy, Al Salzman, was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span> and I helped him grease it and maintain it and, uh, had opportunity to see quite a lot of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Well, and so did he, and its amazing how, uh, you can forget details. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There was so many things going on and if somebody prompts you or if you see a picture, they'll bring back a whole story just about a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Uh, a picture can tell a thousand words. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Well, I took a lot of movies and maybe they'll be put on tape later and that'll explain some of what I'm talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But, uh... .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  What other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">you've, you've described the burial of the dead very well and I thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  Uh, what other parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Oh I, we went through the, uh, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , the different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to see how the people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And....
QUESTION:  What was the condition of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were, this was, in the few days that we were there, the first few days that we were there, there were still some dead in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and we were getting the German people to take them out, and they threw them out like (ph) out in the <span class="DLF">yards</span> , and they were piled up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Then from there they took and put them into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and took them down to the <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And now in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where the, uh, people, where there were six hundred in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , there were two and three people in each <span class="INT_SPACE">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They were so skinny from malnutrition that, uh, two people could sleep side by side very easily and they, there were so few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> they had to take turns sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And, uh, uh, I took pictures, movies inside the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and, uh, I'll never forget these people were so weak that the ones who had, were stronger, would strip the clothes off of the weak ones who couldn't fight back and put those clothes on themselves because they were better for instance than their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">None of these people were issued clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They had uniforms and when the uniforms wore out at this late stage of the war, why they were nude. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And there were so many women just lying nude in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> they and I I felt bad about taking movies of them so I got some of them waving but I didn't make it a point to ... and anyhow I didn't get all those movies home anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But I do have some in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">This will explain what I am talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , uh, in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were four to six high and had to climb up like monkeys and some of them were too weak to get to their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , so they sleep on the bottom one and the ones that were stronger would sleep on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And, uh, that's where I interviewed the young lady from, uh, Sil... <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> , and you'd wonder when you see her, uh, why she looked so, uh, well-nourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It's only because she had of her own via...volition, of her own free will, marched with those prisoners ahead of the Russians to get away from the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And, uh, 1t was an anachronism in the middle of all this starving, starv...and starved people and these human skeletons to see someone looking as well as she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But there were quite a few others that had just been marched in a few days before and hadn't had a chance to starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The way, I hate to even, it, it, it's so silly when you think back on it, how these people just starved to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They would give them rations of one piece of bread, a crumb of bread for a day, and a lot of times the bread was moldy and we started feeding them with soup and, uh, bread which we made from the flour we got downtown. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We got the bakeries going and a little later on we got carpenters in, from the German soldiers, carpenters and plumbers and to get everything back in order because a lot of things were destroyed in the, by the people in fighting and then they destroyed it themselves because they were so sick of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> they were trying to knock down wire and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was, uh, double <span class="DLF">electrified fences</span> to keep them in the compounds and, uh, the bodies were just thrown outside the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> into pile, into piles in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">There's no place else to bur...there's no place to bury them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the <span class="REGION">upper part</span> , until we started digging these <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And, uh, let's see....
QUESTION:  What else did you see in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, the people were lining up, uh, uh, to, uh, go to these, uh, <span class="BUILDING">soup mill</span> ... or <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> or soup pots and what always struck me so odd, the people would be walking without shirts or without pants on, and they didn't think anything of it; they were so used to seeing humans nude most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They stripped them everyday and hosed them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">This is stories that they told us later. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But I actually saw and have movies of people walking around without clothes on and think nothing of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The men in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Uh, the women weren't that, uh, uh, aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">In other words they, they were more polite. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They tried to hide themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And the women that were nude in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> would put their hands over their breasts and it was pathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I'm, I'm glad that it, that it has never been that bad since, uh, that is that we we haven't publicized these things, but what we do know and we hope that it never happens again and, uh, if these pictures will help prove a point, I'm sure they won't happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Did you see the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was, as I said, 1t was down, uh, uh, below the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was on the highest point of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The <span class="DLF">quarry</span> was, was starting to go into the side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> towards the; ultimately they, as I said earlier, the camp would have fallen in if they quarried that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But the the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> , they, they quarried the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> right out of the stone of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and, uh, there were big blocks of stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It was a typical quarry. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They were making building blocks for the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and the <span class="DLF">highways</span> and also for stone <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that they, uh, were putting up here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Uh, most of the stones were going for, uh, <span class="DLF">highways</span> and for reinforcing underground <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and things like that and the people had to carry stones up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , to the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they built a hugh <span class="DLF">dividing wall</span> between the quarters of the SS troopers and the, uh, <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They built a <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> between those and the, uh, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they had the experimental prisoners, where they they inoculated them with all kinds of, uh, germs or they froze them in vats of water and, uh, experimented generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Describe if you would what the experimental compound looked like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Well, uh, if you've ever been in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Army camp</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you'll see rows and rows of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Well, these were a little closer together. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Uh, 1t reminded me of chicken coops on a big chicken ranch, and, uh, there was about seven rows of them and about ten <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in each row. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And there was about two hundred people 1n each one of those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They were smaller than the ones down at the lower side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where, where the quarry prisoners, uh, were quartered, and, uh, I don't know uh....
QUESTION:  What was the condition, what were conditions like inside these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Uh, well they were less crowded because, uh, they still had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> but they had about three high and they still had about two people in 1n each one, but they weren't, they weren't as elaborate, hugh; the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> weren't as big as the ones in the lower camp, the lower section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Uh, they were smaller and only about two hundred people in each, which is almost what we had in our own <span class="BUILDING">Army barracks</span> 1n the States. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We had about a hundred and fifty--well not a hundred and...uh, the bigger ones did but we had about seventy-five men and where we had seventy-five men, they had two hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">That's how much more crowded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were on top of each other whereas we only had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  What were the condition, the physical condition of these prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Well, it was very much the same as these the ones that we saw ear... earlier who were when we first came in--the ones who were the strongest naturally had the guns and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And but these people that we saw were very weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They were all starved and all trying to eat a little soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Uh, we had already started <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> , the first, first day we got there practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Because the Army, we have so many cooks-- every one, every company has a cook--so we didn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We forfeited our food and told our mess sergeants to take it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which they did for the first couple of days until we got steady stream of supplies coming in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Did you go in to the <span class="BUILDING">experimental labs</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  No, I, I, they didn't have them set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They, uh, these experiments were going on before we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">This is what these people were telling us. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I didn't see any of, of these inno... inoculations or bathing in ice water or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It's just, uh, what the people were telling us and what the records show now that from all kinds of witnesses and from the German records and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">It collor...you know; it confirms the stories that we heard then. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Couldn't-- they were unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">In fact most of the guys were in a daze--so when they got, they couldn't, they they didn't want to comprehend what they had seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They wanted to forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">If you ask any of the fellows about what they saw at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they--1t was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It stunk and the smell was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">As I said, I was brought up on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> from age 10, and farm smells didn't bother me, uh, even the vilest, and they were vile--you know, these dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Some of them had been dead for a couple of days or more and then they had dysentery and their rectums were all sore and the, the skin was eaten away. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">These were people that are still alive let alone the dead ones, and they smelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But I--the, the decaying flesh I was used to because on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> we had all sorts of dead animals and it was much the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">To me, I wasn't, uh, it didn't bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But most of the fellows remember the smell because they were city boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They had not, uh, been exposed to this type of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So and as I said, uh, have thought it since then, we were 1n order and we were used to 1t because we had seen these bodies along the <span class="DLF">road</span> for a few days before we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and, uh, we had seen these stripped uniforms and these these human skeletons that, uh, were dead as we went by them, as we went, as we were spear-heading.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Was there anything else about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> that strikes you in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Well, the the security they had: they had the, they built another <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> between the double <span class="DLF">electrified fence</span> which was the original partition between the, the German officers' quarters; they had a double <span class="DLF">electrified fence</span> with this <span class="DLF">trench</span> in between with barbed wire on the ground over the <span class="DLF">trench</span> and, uh, the the security that they had to provide for themselves to keep these people from climbing over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to get at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And, uh, they had machine gun nests at every corner of the <span class="DLF">walls</span> overlooking the compound, and, uh, the other thing I couldn't get over was how the people were all out in the sun trying to sun themselves because they were confined in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> a lot of them and they weren't even out working anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">They were just kept in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they'd feed them with a few crusts of bread and it was a real mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Everything was smelly. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">There were no latrine facilities and, uh, they were doing it out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in you know their bowel movements and so on--such as they had, which wasn't very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in, having taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on maneuvers, I was a medical aide, corpsman we called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Uh, I was quite stricken, uh, stricken I should say by the fact that the genitals, or genitalia of the men and the women were the last things to apparently go because they looked normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">The women's breasts had shrunk quite a bit, but their nipples and, uh, and looked normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And the men's penises and testicles were about normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And the rest of them were absolutely bones and, uh, with skin stretched over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And that's the one thing that I'll never forget is, 1s the condition of, of the things that are needed to reproduce life. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They're the last things to go, as far as I could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">In other words, Mother Nature was trying to save the reproductive organs. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was the one thing that struck me out of looking at all these thousands of dead whenever we buried them. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And as I said, we had these, uh, they couldn't dig the <span class="DLF">graves</span> fast enough so we got our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> to dig the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , push the dirt out and then was a, uh, was a token for the Germans to get shovels and start to shovel the dirt back into the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Well we'd have been there for another two weeks burying them if we had to do everything by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We did dig a few <span class="DLF">trenches</span> by hand, but we then used the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> because there were so many. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They had them stacked up by the hundreds waiting to be buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They couldn't dig the <span class="DLF">graves</span> fast enough by hand, so that's why we got the German, uh, civilians in there to, uh, handle them. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They put them down in the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and laid them side by side and then they would throw a few shovels of dirt in and I'll never forget as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span> , as Al pushed the, uh, stone and sand back into the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , you would hear a stone crunching the ribs and the bones of the poor bodies down below. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It was, because this was backfill for the <span class="DLF">soccer field</span> was made out of backfill and from the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and there were a lot of hard stones mixed in and when they pushed the stones in they further crushed the poor things that were laid to rest in that, uh, <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">After the war they said that they moved the bodies to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper camp</span> --see this was down at the lower level, the <span class="DLF">sports field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Then there was another lower level down around on the quarry level and, uh, there's now a third <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> up on the top where the, uh, the old <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> used to be for the experimental prisoners in the upper part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="312">The <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> is gone now that was 1n between, the <span class="DLF">electrified fences</span> are long gone and shortly after we got most of the people into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">medical tents</span> away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> even. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We moved them out into <span class="BUILDING">field hospitals</span> ; we burned the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> down because they were that smelly and filthy from all the you know unclean--there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> , no la...no facilities for latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They had these ditches 1n the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and when the rains came, it would wash everything down the hillside. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So all that's gone now and it's, it's a <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They said they moved the bodies from that <span class="DLF">sports field</span> or <span class="DLF">soccer field</span> but when I went back in 1975 the trees had grown over it already in 35 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I went there 35 years later and, uh, the, it was so changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Where we had seen all these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there were only; they left three of, uh, in the first row, I think there were three, no four left which were now made a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They showed, they had those on exhibit. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But the huge <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> down below--they had six hundred to eight hundred people in them were all gone, used up for other purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But we did burn most of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> 1n the <span class="REGION">upper part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We left a few in the front which apparently were the cleanest. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And, uh, we went back in 1975 and the Austrian civilians had a dinner for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They provided us with, uh, a chauffeur and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limousine</span> and they, uh, it was unbelievable how they treated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We were like heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And the people, when we went back were hugging us again and trying to touch us and they were grabbing souvenirs and we were giving out little buttons like I have here from my various outfits. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">These are unit insignia. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Here's the 41st Cavalry which happens to be the unit that was the first ones in the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And this Michael Green who was in the 41st Cavalry is going back to Europe this, uh, in 1990 for the 40th Anniversary, 45th Anniversary and, uh, he's bringing some of these along to give to the people for souvenirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But, uh, we were back again in 1980 and we're trying to go back every five years, and we meet the people that we released, and we meet their children, and now we're bringing our children and it's a great thing that the survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , and there were around 12,000 alive when we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I guess maybe un another couple of hundred died and so there were 11,000 actual people alive when we got there, but the ones coming back are the families of the victims who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They come back by the thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But we were back in 1975 there were around 12,000 people there and you wouldn't know how they got there because every <span class="DLF">road</span> was full of these big, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tourists bus</span> that hold fifty people--they were lined up like, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> around a <span class="BUILDING">football stadium</span> in the States. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Incredible where they come from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , Hungaria--all the countries of Europe and, uh, we were, as I said, when they found out we were the liberators they couldn't do enough for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They practically tore the, they wanted our hats; they wanted, they were going to tear the clothes off us. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We were real celebrities. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So I felt good about that and I'm; I just felt so sad about all those that were killed, over a hundred twenty thousand were killed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They're not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It's between a hundred twenty, hundred fifty thousand that they know of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  Is there anything else about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> that you remember in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  Well, nothing except that it was made so the people couldn't get out, and as I said it looked like a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> when we first observed it, and 1t was more like a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> when you got in it, uh, because they don't have the double electrified fences. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Our <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> have <span class="DLF">fences</span> , but not electrified, and, uh, the, uh, condition of the people--the human skeletons walking around was another thing that impressed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">As I said the, uh, that anybody could be alive and that thin when they looked like bones, their legs, their arms, their feet looked swollen in many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That was the only thing that looked anywheres near normal was from their ankles down to their insteps. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Uh, the rest of the bodies were, uh, skin drawn over their faces as if it were shrunk in the heat or whatever--just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I don't know what else to say...the smells as I said were terrible, but I wasn't too fazed by that for some reason, and I think it was because of my upbringing on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">You had mentioned that some of your men were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  Uh, no, only after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Tell us if you would please, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> for thirty days roughly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  Where did you go from...no, before we do that, what--by the time you left at the end of thirty days--what shape was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  Oh, as I said, we started to burn some of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and, uh, the, uh, we backfilled the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and the latrines and most of the people were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The ones who could walk started walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> within a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And, uh, the ones who were very sick we moved out into <span class="BUILDING">field hospitals</span> and, uh, some of those that stayed were trying to help us get the records to find out and to check on how many people were killed and to keep track of everything and we had some of the people working there because they didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">A lot of them were Russians and they didn't want to go back to to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , so, uh, we tried to keep them, uh, working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they, because the they said if we go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> it will be the end of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And it was we found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They were sent to the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> , to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> in other words, and, uh, that was something that I didn't think of until just now, but, uh, they were glad to be left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They didn't want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and we, they, uh, incidentally from after we let the, as I say, uh, should say, we took the demolitions off the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Our group, our engineers were then sent out into, uh, north of CCB and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and thousands, hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and White Russians tried to surrender to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And we accepted their surrender, and, uh, in place, but they wanted to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you know, on our side of the <span class="DLF">line</span> because they didn't want to be anywheres near the Russians and unfortunately our politicians had said this is the <span class="DLF">line</span> of demarcation and all those Russians on that side, I mean Germans, will have to go back to the Russians and so a couple of hundred thousand soldiers that surrendered to us were returned to the Germans [Russians] and shipped to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But that was, that was the 6th of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">In fact it was the afternoon of the 5th, the 6th and the 7th, and on about the 8th I got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and I was there on and off for a couple of days, but the main part was when we got the the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> or <span class="DLF">trenches</span> dug for the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">That was my main job there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  Where did you go when you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Oh, we were sent into various little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , uh, to maintain order and, uh, make sure there was no looting by the, uh, prisoners who had gotten away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They were all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They were going to march <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but they wanted clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They were either stealing it from the Germans or taking it from the Germans, and they were fighting going on and we had to maintain order. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">It was a real madhouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And, uh, we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwanenstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And then from there we were, as engineers, we were sent out to maintain <span class="DLF">roads</span> and rebuild <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and, uh, electrical plants and, uh, to guard the prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> , which was a camp--a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> --and it was now full of SS prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And these haughty bastards, as we called them, were very independent; and, uh, they...they wouldn't...they didn't want to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They thought they were still lords of the universe, being SS and being used to that, uh, having control, uh, full control over civilians and full control over the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They were the masters of Hitler, they were, uh, Hitler's, uh, supermen. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And, uh, we now had them crawling because we didn't feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">They were digging up worms and eating worms. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They dug up all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It was in May and June that we started putting them in, in late May. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And they were digging up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They were eating worms. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I mean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And, uh, they were waiting, praying for rain and we had a few days of rain and the worms would come near the top and they would dig them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And so we started giving them crackers and things, give them a couple of crackers from our K-ration boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And we'd get a wristwatch which was worth maybe seven or eight dollars, and then we sold them to the Russians for over a hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And some of the Russians later on were paying five hundred to a thousand dollars for a Mickey Mouse watch, in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And we were getting these watches from the SS men and then selling them to the Russians for souvenirs, because we all had watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We could get them anytime in the PX for about ten bucks. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And here we were getting a hundred dollars to five hundred dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And some of the fellows that were able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and trade with the Russians got over a thousand dollars for a wristwatch that we got for a cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The cigarettes were worth money to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They were like gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And every soldier had a pack of cigarettes, a carton of cigarettes, a week issued. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Whether you used them or not, you were entitled to a carton. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So a lot of the guys learned how to smoke; and I hate to say this, but many of them are dead now because of the lousy habit. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And their wives always complained, "Oh, yeah, he's been smoking like this ever since he got out of the Army, and dying of emphysema and lung cancer."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Let's go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">There we had double <span class="DLF">electrified fences</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We left them in place. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And, uh, we had <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> and machine guns, and that's what we took turns guarding. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And I hated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I was only there a couple days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="411">In addition to the <span class="DLF">fences</span> , what what did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Well, the, the main <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were 1n back of it and, uh, I yust stayed, we had <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> in a <span class="DLF">wire enclosure</span> which we had put up in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It was something new. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We had built that. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And I...I'd seen Mauthausen, so I didn't go to look at the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> there because I figured they're all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And we were too busy taunting the SS men.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  How did you taunt them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Well, by offering them cigarettes and then crushing them in front of them and then stamping on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  What, uh.... Did you make the SS do, uh, certain chores? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">How did you...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  Well, there was so many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And there was really nothing much for them to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We made them build the <span class="DLF">fences</span> , yeah, their own "corrals" you might call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But we didn't trust them to to do what the ordinary soldiers were doing back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">There, they were restoring the facilities and cleaning up and they were doing the buggy- lugging (ph) when they burnt the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And they were burning up anything stuff that was Nazi that they didn't like--I got a Nazi flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I said, as I was watching it burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I said, "Oh, I'll grab that and see if it's...” And it bur...I guess it's full of holes. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I've never unrolled it since I picked it out of the burning pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I got it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I was going to show it to you, if you were interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But that's the only souvenir that I got from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  The SS, uh, I assume eventually you got, uh, <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> up and you fed them finally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Well, as I said, I was only there a couple of days because I hated guard duty and, uh, it was just standing there watching these guys do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They'd play cards and dig for worms and they didn't have much to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">There was not much of an <span class="REGION">area</span> to dig for worms. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">In a couple of days the worms were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So they were and they were without shirts, they were, uh, their uniforms were, uh, either torn off of them or whatever by somebody but a lot of them didn't have any shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They had pants and, uh, as I said we taunted them the way they did, uh, the civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They would shoot the civilians if they didn't fire at us earlier in the war and, uh, many times the people said the SS made them do it, which was true enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  Did you see any trace of the real prisoners of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> , the former prisoners of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp was,</span> I had been working at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and most of those prisoners now the same as in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had, uh--well, those who were well were walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They weren't going to wait for <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And the sick ones were already in camps, uh, hospital tents with the 26th Infantry Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">See, the 26th Infantry Division later took over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And, in fact, I think they got the credit for taking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Because by the time the newspapers finally got there, they claimed--the 26th Infantry Division claimed--they had liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They did, in a way; but not the way the 11th Armored did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We are almost finished with the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Is there anything else that you want to add, anything else that you saw that relates to the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  I'd like to bring out a point which I don't see, uh, discussed very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And that 1s the fact that I personally knew thirteen men that were killed in action, and some right along side of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And, uh, three hundred were killed in the Battle of the Bulge in the first few days of combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And then ultimately we lost eight hundred men killed, and four thousand wounded or injured; and, uh, these were all expended in the effort to save Europe from Hitler's Nazi terrorism. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And, uh, I'd like to bring that out, that we made a lot of sacrifices and those fellows that did it did it for the freedom not only of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And it's a point that is only brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when you go over and you walk over their <span class="DLF">graves</span> , which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And you think of the 45 years, it was 40 years when I walked on the <span class="DLF">grave</span> of my best friend, accidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I backed up to take a picture of Patton, his monument, which is at the head of the uh —— Cemetery. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And I backed up to get the big cross in and I put my hand down on a tombstone, and as I walked around it I looked and it was August uh Heddenbock (ph), my buddy from back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And I just bawled. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I am sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I'm just overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But that is what I'm thinking about--how lucky we are, all of us, to be here, to see the tapes, to have a free world, and even with the events happening today to see it coming to pass that our efforts have not been in vain. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And that is the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that we lost a lot of good buddies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  I cannot think of a more fitting way to end this interview, and I thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Well, I thank you for the opportunity to express these thoughts and, and hope then as I say that it will never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Thank you, Doctor, for interviewing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I appreciate it. </span>
