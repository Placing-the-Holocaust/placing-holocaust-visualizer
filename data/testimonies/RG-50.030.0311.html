ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And then, just going back a little further to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , before we go on, I'd love it for you to tell me a little bit more about what life was like before the war, and whether you experienced antisemitism, whether you mingled with the Christian people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- what, what, what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">A. Jews usually did not mingle with the, with the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">In going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- there were two <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , one actually closed after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">There was a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which was run by the State. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">The <span class="BUILDING">State high school</span> was the privileged school and there’s -- there was a quota with the, with the <span class="BUILDING">State High</span> -- with the State gimnazjum. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Not all the Jews that wanted were allowed to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">By strange coincidence, the other <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> ; however the majority of Jews, Jewish children, went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was called the handlowka.” </span><span class="sentence" id="7">That was a <span class="BUILDING">commerce school</span> where you were prepared for accounting, for bookkeeping, so something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was run by a order of, of Cath-- Catholic priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">But Jews were accepted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">There was no quota in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Because I was one of the few who was accepted to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic High</span> -- to the <span class="BUILDING">State high school</span> from the very beginning -- and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we had eight years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">B. Later, during my time, they changed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It was six years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and two years of lyceum. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was like the last two years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , they changed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They called it lyceum. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The quota was sort of rescinded and many, many more Jews were allowed into this, into this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We formed a very close circle of friends, none of us were non- Jewish -- strictly by religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">If Jewish girls were out with a Christian boy, it happened -- * <span class="BUILDING">Commercial school</span> (Polish). </span><span class="sentence" id="19">the opposite happened very, very seldom. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It more often that the Jewish girls were out with Christian boys, it was sort of like a black mark on their record. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was held against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But we did make friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we were quite friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">However, like everywhere, the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kids were -- the Christian high school kids -- were in, in the front of ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So when Marshal Pilsudski died in 1935, and the reactionary, the real chauvinistic -- I forgot the man, the man’s name, took over, there was one of the few pogroms in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The pogrom consisted basically of not killing people, but destroying property. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">There were some broken <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">There were some broken <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and maybe a few Jews were beat up, but no one got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">No one was tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It was more or less you had to stay off the <span class="DLF">street</span> because you knew if they catch you, you were going to get a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">That lasted a day or two and then it was forgotten, and we were good friends all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Did you personally --
ANSWER:  It was sort of, it was sort of directed by the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">They were told, “You have to do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">What was your question? </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Q. I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Did you personally ever get beat up, or people say things to you, or experience any of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">A. Oh, I was told many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I was told, but never physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I never had any physical harm, but I saw them breaking <span class="DLF">windows</span> and walking around with what you would describe now as a baseball bat. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Actually we didn't play any baseball, they were just sticks. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Hitting <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> , because most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Lida</span> was Jewish businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I would say probably 95 percent or more of the businesses 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were Jewish, Jewish-owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The Poles were mostly farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It's strange but many times on, on some occasions we were told by our friends, Watch out. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Don't go out this evening because there will be like a rumble.” </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We were friendly with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So, you stood <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It’s -- the division was strictly on a religious basis, and in opposite to what you have in here as far as Jews, are concerned, you had the Hasidim, the real Orthodox, and the traditional, what you would describe here. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But still men and women were separated, or they were on different -- they were usually on different <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The women were upstairs, the men were downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But there was no such a thing as modern Judaism, the Reform Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It didn't exist in, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Q. What about your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">A. My grandfather, who basically raised me with my grandmother, they were I would say Orthodox, but not Hasidim. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They observed all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They did everything according to the good book, but they were not what I would say in their dress and their behavior, they were modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But I did have an uncle who married my grandfather's sister- it’s not my uncle, my mother's uncle -- who was a hosed.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="59">In fact, I became quite acquainted with the, with the Hasidim, because I said Kaddish* for my father for 11 months after he died, and the only one that would go to -- that went to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> three times a day was my mother's uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">> Follower, admirer (Yiddish). * </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Hebrew prayer for mourners (Hebrew). </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, I used to go to his <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , to his Hasidishe shtibl,° to say Kaddish for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And that’s what I, more or less, I got acquainted with the Hasidim. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It’s not that I -- I did admire them for their staunch behavior, for their staunch belief, for the way they behaved in spite of all the adversity, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was -- didn't exactly admire them, because they, they were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">See, the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from what I -- at least in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , tried to more or less assimilate. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They didn't try to separate themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They tried to live like the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">In fact, they lived better than the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They were more Polish than the Poles themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Now, I remember that in my parent's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- because my father came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ; my mother met him when my -- her parents, my grandparents, ran away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> for several generations, but they ran away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> in the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="72"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> was a <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> , so they ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tsarizin</span> in the -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tsarizin</span> was known by another name, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , during the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They lived there for a few years, and they met my father, who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Khar’kov</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , which is now <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">At that time it was all <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My father married my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He was 10 or 11 years older than her, but she was a beautiful girl, and they -- he came together with his in-laws to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They built that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> I have mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I used to go there with him, watch them pour molten iron into forms, and they liked me, I think, the people that worked for him, they liked me because — they, they, they liked me even later. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But after he died, and my mother remarried, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> sort of reverted to the rest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It was my uncle that was running it, and, and my mother's uncle actually paid my mother off, and he had that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Q. [Technical conversation] Ok...so when the Russians took over your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in 1939, what > <span class="BUILDING">Hasidic house</span> (Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="84">did that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">What sort of changes took place? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">A. When the Russians came in 1939, the change-- the changes were major. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">First of all, the Russian classified everybody in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The first classification was: were you a working man, or were you a capitalist, or so-called “bourgeois.” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Second, they also, on your passport which they gave you, besides your social status, if you were a working man or not, they listed your religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I had a friend whose father was the chief engineer of a rubber factory in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Our -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> was quite industrial. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It had two <span class="BUILDING">foundries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that produced nails used for construction, and a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that produced rubber; usually they produced -- what’s the English? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Galoshe-- Galoshen (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What’s that? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Rubber, rubber boots.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Galoshes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Galoshes. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">The chief engineer of that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , his son, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together, we were the best of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So when the Russians came in, and they na-- of course immediately they nationalized all the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , but they left the chief engineer in charge, because, after all, he was a working man. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He gave me a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He gave my mother a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So, I was able to get a passport which stated that I was a student working, but the Jew, the “Evrei,’° remained on the passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My mother was able to get a passport that she was working -- “Rabochiy,’”’ but still Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">All the, the rest of the family got passports that they were capitalists, and they were banned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> was too close to the © Jew (Russian). ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Working (Russian). </span><span class="sentence" id="107"><span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">You had to be at least a hundred kilometers from the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> was closer than a hundred kilometers, so they were banned and my grandparents had to move into a small- very, very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It's not even a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it's -- was a settlement, whatever you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">More inland, more father away from the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">In the meantime, my mother's younger sister -- she had two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">That would have been the middle sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">She was married to an engineer, a chemical engineer, whose brother was an electrical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They built in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> a little <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which made rubber heals. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Prior to that, he gained these experience by building <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">He built -- he was -- he built a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">He built a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and my aunt was traveling with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He spent, spent a few years 1n each <span class="NPIP">place</span> because he could not find work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> -- or in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Then he decided he and his brother build a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where -- that was making rubber heals. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">When the Russians came in, they of course nationalized the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and they had to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So him and his brother and the brother's family went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">When the Russians came in, they gave <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> a short-lived independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The <span class="DLF">border</span> was not closed immediately, so you could travel actually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My aunt, my mother's sister, remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> to liquidate her possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">She was selling everything off. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She sold everything, and she decided to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> illegally with some other people that I knew, and they got caught by the, by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The trial was immediate. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The sentence was immediate. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> , banished there. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We knew all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">There is a reason why I am mentioning that. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That’s part of my general experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Also, we had a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It's not, not my cousin, it's my mother's cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It’s all- but I still call him a cousin, who was a doctor, and being, being a doctor, being of draft age, he and his brother, both of them were drafted into the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The brother, being just an accountant, was a private. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The doctor, because he was a doctor, became an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They were -- they became pri-- Russian prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The private escaped, and he survived in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But the doctor, eventually he perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katyn</span> , in the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> when 10,000 Polish officers were killed by the Russians on Stalin's orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But his wife and daughter were arrested, sentenced immediately, and sent to Si-- to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , also, also to <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That's where my aunt met both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The reason why I am mentioning it is when we decided -- when we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> -- I'm jumping again. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">When we -- when my mother and I got the good passports, I still wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> , but the nearest <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , which was 600 kilometers south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">That was too far to leave the family, so my compromise was to study physics at the University of Vilna. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , and I tried to enroll there. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">However, they closed the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> and -- between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> -- between the Soviet Union and <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and travel would have been impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So, I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , and I think it was already March of 1940, we decided with my mother to go and settle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Now the -- when the Russians came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , beside nationalizing the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , they requisitioned all the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They requisitioned all the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I lived with my grandparents and with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they had a sort of an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the back, and we lived in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They chased everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They limit -- gave us, I think, two or three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and that was for seven people. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">In the beginning, we had a Russian colonel -- a Russian general -- living with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But that was sort of, more or less -- I became friendly with, with some Russian, with some Russian airmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We used to indulge in vodka together, Have gefilte fish on a Friday with vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We became friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I was doing nothing at the time, except working occasionally in the <span class="BUILDING">rubber factory</span> to maintain my status that I am still a working man, but my goal was to get out and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="161">Technical conversation] When we left -- and this is rather important -- when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> and went for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , we didn't realize how crowded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">All the refugees, mostly Jews that escaped Hitler from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> at that time had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> of over 150,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> actually more than doubled with the refugees because of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Finding <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> was absolutely impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So, when we came, we started to look and look, and eventually we found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with a Polish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was an older Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He was at that time in his 60s. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">He had a -- with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They lived on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He was like a general contractor. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He was, I'd would say, about a kilometer from the last stop of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> , and that Pole actually played a major part, an extremely major part in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Q. Ok, you’ve arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , and I want you to tell me something about the life there in the community, and, and I know it was an important <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so what was your life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">A. It was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was an extremely important thing with the -- this Polish family: Czachor; his name was Jan, her name was Marja. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They were both elder Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I had a lot of conversations with him because on the beginning my main aim was to enroll into the Polytechnic institute of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , which actually didn't -- that was April, and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wouldn't start for at least five months or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Q. This is in what year? </span><span class="sentence" id="180">A. 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, I was actually doing -- I was doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">My mother found a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">She was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Every job with the Russians was for the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">There was no such a thing as private employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We had to -- we had some saved up money, of course, because they could have -- they confiscated the property, but they did not take away, the Russians didn't take away the tangible goods: the monies, the gold, the, the, the silver, the jewelry, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So that was still negotiable. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Q.

Can you describe for me the first few days of German occupation: what was going on in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ; what you were doing; what you were thinking? </span><span class="sentence" id="295">A. We were -- our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we lived was not in the Jewish area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We lived with a aristocratic Polish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They hated us, but they, sort of, they were more or less restrained, except for their son. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">In the beginning, there was no such a thi-- Jews moved normally throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Having 150,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> became like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">There were nobody -- there was nothing but Jews in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, that was easy for them to find where the Jews were. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So, if they needed Jews for work, to clean up something, they used to grab them, go -- take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , go into that <span class="REGION">area</span> , and grab them. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I had an experience that must have been about a week after the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We still -- there was still no order that we had to wear armbands with the Star of, Star of David, so basically I was dressed like anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I didn't look typically Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The only one that would know that I was Jewish were my immediate neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I was coming up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the Ukrainian militia was coming down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , said, “Are you this and this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I said, “Yes, that's my name.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="309">You're Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I say so -- I denied on the beginning. “</span><span class="sentence" id="311">Give us your passport.” </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I said, “I don’t have it with me.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="313">Let's go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I asked him, “How do you know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Oh, he says, “We were told by somebody reliable how you look and that you were Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And that was the son of that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They grabbed me to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">One of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that we worked was the general <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , where the Russians have killed all the political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They sort of massacred them. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We moved bodies from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> onto, onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Those bodies were decaying already, and everybody knew the Russians did it; not the Germans, that one -- that massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">After that they grabbed me again to go to work, and we went to work on the de-- on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad depot</span> of <span class="DLF">Janowska street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323"><span class="DLF">Janowska street</span> was a place where the-- later was developed into a notorious <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I worked on <span class="DLF">Janowska street</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">In fact, what happened to me, the first time they got me, they took my passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I was able to get the passport back. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I looked at the passport and the passport was written on parchment with India ink. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">India ink does not sink into the parchment. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It lays on top of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And being an engineering student, I used to do some drafting with the India ink. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I knew if you took a very sharp razor blade you can sort of peel off the India ink from the parchment without leaving a sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">You can scrape it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So, I scraped the word , “Evrei,” -- Jew, and I wrote in the word “Belarus,” -- white Russian, with India ink, the same color India ink. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So, the next time they got me I showed it to them -- “I'm not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I am -- what do you want from me? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I'm a white Russian.” </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I couldn't fool them. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The guy grabbed my passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He says, “Go there, go to work; when you come back we'll examine it more care-- more, more carefully.” </span><span class="sentence" id="340">When we got back, I saw that passport was laying on the side, and there was a girl that was watching it with a, with a number of other papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I, sort of, got back and I sweet-talked her, and I swiped that passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I stole it from -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I -- my mother burned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">She says, “If they're going to catch you with that thing, and they know who you are, all they have to do is say one word: ‘Put your pants down.’” </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And because it’s -- the point of circumcision was strict-- was restricted to Jews only in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Not like in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where, let’s say, most of the males are circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So, she burned the passport, and I was without a passport and I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I worked for a while on <span class="DLF">Janowska street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We were carrying bales of hay from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The pay was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">After a day’s work, if they were pleased, we used to get a loaf of bread, a loaf of black bread, pumpernickel bread, which was more than you can imagine because, who could consume a big loaf of bread that must have been, if you really -- if you look at it, that would be probably a four, five pound loaf of bread? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">You could trade bread for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And that was still before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">My mother used to do the trading. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I used to -- sometimes I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with two loaves of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The Germans -- the German officer was good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We did a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We were young and strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">There was no such a thing as beating at the time, but I have noticed that they was star-- they started to put up a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around certain <span class="REGION">area</span> on Janowska. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I said, “As long as they put up a <span class="DLF">fence</span> ,” -- a barbed wire fence, not just a <span class="DLF">fence</span> -- I says, “I don't like it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And I -- one day I told them I am sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Another day I told them I don't feel so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I sort of talked myself out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And by the time they closed in and they made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , I was no longer on <span class="DLF">Janowska Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I have mentioned to you, I think, that my -- or maybe I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">My grandfather had a brother who was also in that found-- partner in the <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">They had a daughter -- in fact, two daughters and a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">One daughter married, and she married a guy who was a -- he likes to be, he liked to be a bigshot, sort of was a makher. ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="369">He was a -- had a hand in everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">When the German - and they moved as well, they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">He was able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when just be-- while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was being formed, or just before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he knew a family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> who were socially or politically active in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> before the war, and through them you could get a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I didn't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We didn't need them, but with the Germans, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you worked was of the utmost importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Work papers, you had to have a document showing where you are employed, where you are working. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And the things that you were doing there were rated according to certain priorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We didn't know it on the beginning, but a different colored card meant life or death. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I'm jumping the gun a little bit. ” </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Influential person, bigshot (Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="380">In the fall of '41 -- I don't remember if it was September, I think, or October -- it was the first announcement that the Germans made of creating a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> .

Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">There was a time already at, of -- where Jews had to wear armbands, and they were prior to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">If a German approached you, a Jew was not supposed to be on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You had to walk in the <span

id="471">If there was any way how they could humiliate you, they found a way how to do tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Again, I didn't live in the Jewish -- in the real <span class="REGION">Jewish area</span> , but the things that I have heard- and I saw it myself -- where they used to grab the real religious one and cut the pe’ahsin, cut the beard, make them lick their boots to a shine, beat them to a, to a, to a point where they were unconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They wouldn't bother -- maybe they wouldn’t bother young people like myself, because after all, we di-- didn't look different. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We still had the armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But it during -- while this was going on, I still kept in touch with that Polish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">The only way how I could do it is you used -- we -- I used to get dressed a little better, not report to work, slip the armband off into my pocket, grab the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> , take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> to the end of its run, and then walk that kilometer and go over to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a talk -- just to maintain a friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We were talking to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He told me he was working with the Polish underground resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">He gave me some names of the contacts- “In case you need it, you can rely on some people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I knew that he had a radio transmitter, and radio receiver, and a cache of arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">The reason why he was able to have all that; he had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">The front of it was like a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , like a <span class="BUILDING">carpenter's shop</span> , and he was able to hide all these things between the stacks of lumber and stacks of other things, between his tools, and they never bothered him. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">As the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was tightening, and the Aktions became prevalent every couple of weeks, we were lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We had to line -- first of all they built a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">You had to enter through a main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I remember one time that was in the -- late in the fall of '41, we were coming from work, because my job for most of the time through that cousin that I have mentioned that was a, a makher in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with the other family. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the other family, and they didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">This cousin and himself and his wife -- rather, no, his wife was the cousin -- they didn't survive; but their daughter and her sister, they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I was able to get the right documents for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">My job was what you call “Rohstuffverfassung”’ -- “gathering raw materials.” </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We used to go to demolish <span class="NPIP">places</span> , to demolished <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , to <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they used to gather all kinds of raw material and put copper to copper, steel to steel, brass to 'S Gathering raw materials (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="492">brass, gold to gold, silver to silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">God forbid if anyone took a piece of gold or a piece of silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">That meant, if they caught you, that one meant immediate execution on the spot, right on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Because you were searched at their whim. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But the documents were excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">There were many times where the group, when we were lined up to go to work, and there were thousands of people on the main square of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , thousands and thousands, and the Germans used to come in and say, “This group, go to the left; and this group, go to the right.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We used to show them our papers and, “This group, go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And we always happened to go in the right direction where we, we were able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The document saved -- definitely saved our lives by being in the right group with the right -- the beatings during the, during the work, while we were working, were rather rare. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We didn't get paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Occasionally they gave us some food; you had to sort of maneuver yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But being on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , we were able to be in touch with the outside world and talk to people and do a lot of finagling where we were able to smuggle in things into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They didn't check us as well as they checked the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We were, sort of call it, the Rohstuffverfassung was the elite, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We survived -- I survived that way the Aktions where they went after the old. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They went after the young. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">They went after the sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They went after just about anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I have witnessed atrocities beyond anybody's belief, belief and description. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Because when they used to put us aside to wait what's the whim of the ghetto commander, or whoever he was, I -- one was Wilhelm (ph), I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Another one -- I don't recall their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Gr-- Gruber (ph), I think; I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We were -- I saw them beat to pulp, execute, kill, shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I saw them take a little baby and tear it in half. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">That's one image I'll never forget in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It, it, it just -- how subhuman. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Germans did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The Ukrainians did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Now, how would you -- Germans were in German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">The Ukrainians, they had their own uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Poles were not there, but there were -- they had a group of Russian prisoners of war which turned on the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They gave them a name which I don't recall -- which co-- collaborated with the Germans that, that, that did the dirty work. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was practically reduced to, to nothing, because from 150,000, when 1943 came there was 20,000 left through de-- through killings, deportations to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , local executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They used to kill and bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They had, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Janowska</span> , there were places where they used to -- with <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> where they were just killing one on top of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And all this time they were shrinking and reducing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , moving the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and making it smaller and smaller until -- 1t was right after New Years of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where this Gajkowsk1, that's my cousin’s husband, my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">There was another man by the name of Pupko that was from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and I was, I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">My mother wasn't there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Came to us and told us that “The next three nights are going to be absolutely awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">You better try to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">If you survive, you-- you'll be able to come back, but it's going to be absolutely awful.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Now, the reason why my mother wasn't there is sometimes that summer toward fall she was in touch with a Polish woman, a peasant Polish -- Polish peasant woman that used to come to the <span class="DLF">ghetto wall</span> , and she used to sort of give her items of clothing, items of jewelry, and exchange it for bread for, for food with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">You could do it in certain <span class="NPIP">spots</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So the woman said to her, "Why don't you come and stay with me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="537">My mother was very skeptical. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Can I trust her? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Because many people -- there were many, many things known where people used to let in Jews, then chase them out or call the Germans and take away all their belongings, all their property, all their jewelry -- whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So, my mother said, "I'll try. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">After all, I still have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I'll leave some things with you, and I'll go there." </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So, she went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">It was about 35 kilometers out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , in the direction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ternopol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">She went there, and she stood there for several weeks until -- and I know it because she told me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">My mother told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The woman came to her that someone said to me -- [Technical interruption | So the Polish woman said that she was told by someone that, “You must have someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">You're hiding someone because we saw strange shadows moving in the middle of the night.” </span><span class="sentence" id="549">See, my mother was hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> on top but she had to take out all her body waste in the middle of the night and dump it somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So someone noticed someone running around in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So she says, “You can't stay here and you have to come back to -- you, you have to get out of here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="552">She left -- so she left the woman and started to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> to come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">As they were coming -- she met -- as she was coming, she met another woman, and you know two Jews -- two Jewish women, they sort of, you recognize each other, even if you are dressed like a Polish peasant with a babushka and all that, but you sort of you know, you recognize each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They recognized that they were both Jewish women, and they both proceeded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , and not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , they were caught by a patrol, by a German patrol, who was out searching for escaped Jewish boys from, from, from <span class="DLF">Janowska

The first day -- few days of liberation we were trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to live and we were given, by the, by the Russian authorities -- I don't know how to call them, occupation or, or liberated -- in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was occupied by a German general, who ran away leaving a lot of things 1n tact; a lot of food, some beer, some -- a bunch of other things, which normally we wouldn’t ex-- normal people wouldn't expect to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">He ran away real fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Later, they took it away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">They said it's too good for you, but at least we had it on the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Then, it was a matter when, when we left our hiding, I had on me nothing but rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">From sliding on the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement floor</span> into -- in and out of that <span class="DLF">hiding hole</span> , all the clothes were just in, in, in shambles. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">There was nothing but <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">You couldn't keep anything <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because everything was moldy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">You had to delouse yourself because the fleas were as -- they were the size of flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">When they jumped you could hear them jump on top of, on top of straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">It was a matter of finding some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">It was a matter of going on to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">They had a Russian name for it called tolkuchka.'’ </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Tolkuchka, it means “one was pushing the other,” where you sort of, whatever you had for sale, someone would buy it from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I remember on the very '7 <span class="BUILDING">Black market</span> (Russian). </span><span class="sentence" id="956">beginning, because I spoke fluent Russian -- after all I, and a good Russian, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">After all, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; most of my subjects were taught in Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Interesting, one of the courses that I tried to use, get credit for it, as Economics in here, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , was the basis -- the basic study of Leninism and Stalinism. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">They didn't give me any credit for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">They said, “That's not our economics,” but I tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">That was taught in Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">A Russian soldier stopped me, and he says, “Can you buy from me something? </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I say, “I can't buy from you; I have no money, but if you hang around here for a few hours, I'll sell it for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And those were can, cans of American ham and beans, like C-rations, but big cans that the American, that the Americans supplied the Russian army with. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">They were being sold on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , and I sold some of them at a very, very good profit because it didn't cost me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And whatever the Russian soldier got, I mean, he was happy to get something for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">That was my first <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">From -- after that I -- that’s the only way I could survive and, and do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I used to buy paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I found a <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span> that used to print lines on the paper, then I found someone who that a bound, a bound-- a bindery, and used to make notebooks, with a couple of staples and a notebook with a cover, and we used to sell notebooks to the Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">That was like over a thousand percent profit. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">They used to go like hotcakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And, like everything else, it lasted for a while and then, then -- someone -- then, then the Russian government started to print it. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">But until then -- so we made some money that way, and then I started to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Q. Did you feel safe? </span><span class="sentence" id="977">A. Yes, I did feel safe, in spite of the fact that at one time my mother worked for a <span class="BUILDING">supply depot</span> , and her boss said to her, “You know, I'd like to sell a few big cans of imitation honey butter.” </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It's like a honey butter spread which was strictly Ger-- which was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So, she says, “Ok, I'll try,” and she got me. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I took some of it, and I went to sell 1t on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and the cops, the Russian police, grabbed me, arrested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">They locked me up. “</span><span class="sentence" id="982">Where did you get it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="983">First I didn't tell them, then I got in touch with this man who supplied it, and I asked him, “What should I do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="984">He says, “Don't worry, you can tell that you got it from me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I told him I got it through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">He says, “And I thought we cracked a major, a major thing, a major --“ And they let me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">That was the only time I was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">Russian jail</span> for 24 hours, interrogated. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">It's not on my record. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">They never kept the records of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Q. What about the local population? </span><span class="sentence" id="991">A. That's why I didn't feel, I didn’t feel threatened. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">The Russian po-- the local population, the Ukrainians, they ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">The ones that did the Ukrainian militia, and so on, they ran way from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">The Poles, they didn't want to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">They tried to move to the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">So who were -- I think -- the people that remained were the Jews, the liberated Jews that were there, that weren't too many at all, and the ethnic Russians, that came there because the life there was much better than in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So I felt fairly safe, especially -- I would call myself that I was within -- between the intellectual elite. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">After all, I was a college student. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">I was in second year of <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> with a, with a scholarship from the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">It's not that I believed in their system, but I could get all the benefits from it without putting anything into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So, when the Russians gave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or the we-- they extended <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> west, so that they could keep the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that they have occupied 1n '39, like <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">They announced that Poles, or anyone who is willing to repatriate himself into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , is free to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">You can take with you anything you can carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Of course, you can't move <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , but you can take anything you can carry, with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So, in -- I think it was in '45 in August, I think, -- yeah, around August -- we decided that there's no future in there and we're going to repatriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">We got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Q. Let me just ask you a couple questions here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">When you said th-- that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> most of the people were ethnic Russians or the few remaining Jews, what size of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> are we talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Were they able to kind of reclaim the community? </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">The Jewish community may be from all -- because whoever was liberated, they sort of came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , because there is a safety in numbers and safety in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">When I say there were Jews, there were still Poles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">A lot of Poles, the community was several thousand, but not even in 10 thousand, several thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">The small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , after the liberation, they had pogroms, believe it not, where the local population -- you see, Jews, when they came back, they try -- tried to claim their property. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Of course, the locals didn't want to give it to them, so how -- what's better than try to get rid of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">The, the, the expression was always, there were -- “Why didn't they kill you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">You are too many of you left.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">The local populous was al-- they were always Jew haters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">They always despised the Jews, if it was before the war or after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">There were very, very few that were sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">My -- our friend Czachor, the one that saved our life, when we confronted him in conversations: “Why are you doing it -- ? “ [</span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Technical interruption | A. Czachor, when you -- when we confronted him on many occasions, we had a lot of discussions with him; after all, we were doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">We were the intellectuals, and he was a carpenter who became a contractor, whose children were educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">They were both- both his daughters were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">In fact, I used to send them packages later when we ended up in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">He says, “I didn't do it for money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He says, “I had to have the money because I am not a rich man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I couldn't feed and sustain, and what was the harm if I made a couple of bucks?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He didn't live to enjoy it, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">He said, “I'm doing it strictly for, for humanitarian reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I can't see people being slaughtered and exterminated for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">The only reason is because they were born to the wrong parents or to certain type of parents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I mean, the fact that he supported, he was with the Jews and the army of Armia Krajowa at the same time, was a contradiction in itself because the Armia Krajowa, they never said they were antisemitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">But in their actions, they never supported the Jewish resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> itself, the Jewish police, which was -- whose basic job was to maintain order having 150,000 people living in one small <span class="REGION">area</span> , and selecting people for extermination; like they say, “I li-- you live and he dies or what?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">They -- somebody had to, somebody had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Now, was it more humane that the Jewish police did it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Was the -- were the Jewish police traitors to the-- to their fellow Jewish brothers? </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I wouldn't call them traitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I think it was their way how to survive maybe a little longer, hoping that that they can save their families, when frankly they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">If they didn't do 1t somebody else would have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">It's not that they -- if they didn’t do it, it wouldn't have been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">It would have been done maybe in a more, more cruel wa-- cruel way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">The end result would have been the same; it's just a matter of how you, how you slaughter somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">The Jewish police warned many people, like they warned me, about the forthcoming Aktions; and if not for them maybe I wouldn't have been alive now with that January '43 incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Then again, there was a time when they couldn't meet their quotas given to them by the Germans -- and for a fact, I know it, I can really -- I can testify to it -- that they were sort of exchanging: “You, you tell where my grandparents are hidden and I'll tell where your grandparents are hidden.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">When you had to -- when, when they couldn't meet the quotas, says, “After all, they'll go sooner or later,” for the -- when the, when the, when the Aktion was to get, get the older, the disabled, the sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">One would sort of tell not where his relatives were hidden, but would point out where the other ones, and the other one would point to the other fellow's relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Now, I didn't know if I cou-- I don’t know if -- I didn’t want to be a Jewish cop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I could have been but I didn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I was approached. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I didn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I, I felt that this is just cruel and inhuman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I'd rather get killed myself than, than point to someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Q. How did people get chosen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">A. Appearance, age, state of health, and luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Q. Connections? </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">A. Just -- it was a matter of luck, that you were in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the right time, because I know there were times when someone escaped from Janowska, and we knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Every 10th guy they gave the, the, the commander, the ch-- head, used to give for him -- for, for, for the escapees to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">If th-- if they didn't come back, every 10th guy was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">They just walked and counted: “10.” [</span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Makes shooting sound] Bullet to the head, and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And no one was allowed to move or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Now, how did they pick the 10? </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">It was nothing but luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And if the men didn’t -- if the men did come back, it were -- there were, there were cases if the men did come back, they still did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Q. Actually, what I was asking was, you were talking about the police and how people got selected to, to be a member of the Jewish police or of the Judenrat? </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">A. The Judenrat is the activists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">The first Judenrat was hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">The first Judenrat of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> -- I remember going out to work, coming back, and there were 12 people hanging right across the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> so everybody could look and see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Not shot, but hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">So you didn't look, so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">But they were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Because of the whimsy of the, of the German occupation, whoever he was that ordered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">There was no consensus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">There was no such a thing as a discussion or due process or law or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">The German, the command-- the commandant, he was the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">He was the absolute king over life and death, the absolute power if you live or you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">There was no, no discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">In fact, if you said anything, that was -- if you talk against, it was enough to be shot or be beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">The tortures were unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">The kind of tortures they thought of were beyond description. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">There is -- you think of a way, and they did it worse. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Brief technical conversation] Q. Ok, so I don’t know; we were talking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , maybe you want to continue there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Give me a few -- maybe some more details of, of what life was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">A. Life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov ghetto</span> was very, very I gu-- it’s difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">It's difficult to describe because one day was just like another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">When there was no Aktion, we did our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Nobody bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">When there were Aktions, it was just like, like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I remember at one time we were -- one Aktion, which was completely by surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">We went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">While we were at work, they made an Aktion in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">It -- an Aktion, I mean when they, when they took a thousand people, that meant no-- nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I think, when I describe an Aktion is five, 10,000 people had to, had to be exported, liquidated, or killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">They -- we got stuck in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were growing -- where a, a family was growing nothing but beets, white -- not red beets for borscht -- but white beets, because you can make sugar out of white beets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And for three days we had nothing but white beets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">We ate white beets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">We cooked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">We, we, we, we simmered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">We did all kinds of possi-- all kinds of things because we were afraid to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">That was the only thing that sustained us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">We weren’t able -- because if you were, if you were caught during the Aktion, sometimes even the best favors wouldn't save you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">They numbered the quota, the order of to liquidate, to, to, to solve the Jewish problem, was higher than the, the papers that would save you, the documents that would save you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">That had priority over everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Q.

Basically, there are, more or less I would call it, three incidents that, that got to me more or less more than other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">One would be the first time when we came from work, when I saw the Judenrat, the 12 hanging at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">Maybe because I sort of believed on the beginning that maybe the Germans are sort of civilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">That would have been the first act of murder committed directly by the Germans that I would attribute directly to the, the, the Nazi command. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">The second one is during one of the Aktions, where on the main square we were lined up, and we were waiting to get to move to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">That was during one of the Aktions where they were getting the old and the young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">And it was rather quiet, and all of a sudden there was a cry of a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">The German officer was startled because supposedly that all of the young and all of the old were already gone and there was nobody left, and he sent the -- these people to, to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">And he says, “You stand here, and you don't move until I find what's going on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">Now, that was translated to me because my German was not that good to understand everything he said or even to hear what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">But that was related to me by some, some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">And then they finally pulled a little girl out from, from a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , from a hidden <span class="NPIP">place</span> , under something -- camouflage place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">She must have been choking or what that she cried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">The two Ukrainian policeman started to toss her from one to the other, and then the German says, “Ehh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">That's no good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">And two Germans, one grabbed her by one leg, one grabbed her by the other leg and they pulled her apart, the little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">She screamed out, and then she was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">Q. That was in 1941? </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">That was in ‘42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1625">QUESTION:  42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1626">ANSWER:  That was in ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">That was in fall of '42 because the weather was still nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">The third incident was when they -- our group, we were on the way to work and we were grabbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was standing next to -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> pulled up, and the head of our group was arguing, the argument that ensued between him and the Sonderkommando”*? </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">A guy with the, with a black uniform, black SS -- the, the SS man, he wanted us, and this guy said, “No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">They are going to work.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And finally the -- our Jew convinced our SS man, our guy, that whatever we are going to do today is of such importance that he can't spare us, not even for a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">He gave the -- that, that man with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> took somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">He got another group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">We found out that no one from the other group survived, and that was sort of like, like fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">We were as close as it can be to, to perishing at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">But, but maybe we didn't know it at the time how close we came to, to, to being annihilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">In fact, every day was like -- more or less like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">You never, you never knew if you were coming back or not because they were quite capricious and they could have -- they could do anything they wanted anytime they wanted for what’s-- for no reason whatsoever, without being afraid of ever being questioned, punished, or having to respond -- being responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">It's just like if someone goes and kills a fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">When do-- who does he have to respond to? </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">No one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">I mean it's they were dealing with non-humans, not even subhumans, but non-humans whose existence didn't mean anything to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">After all, sooner or later you, you, you were destined to 33 Special Jewish detachment assigned to work in the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">be, to be exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">Q. Was most of the, the abuse that you saw or experienced perpetrated by the Germans or by the local Ukrainians? </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">A. I would give it 50/50, however, whenever the Ukrainians did it, the Germans were present. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">It's not that the Ukrainians or the Poles or whoever else did it by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">There was always a German present, like they didn't trust them enough, and because of it, they were over-anxious, and they did it twice as, twice as good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">Q. Are there other episodes you want to mention? </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">A. No, I think that's enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1653">QUESTION:  That’s enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1654">ANSWER:  That’s enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">Q. One, one -- I guess one last question for you: what gave you whatever strength you needed to get through all of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">A. My mother was a very strong woman because whenever she saw a German, she used to stick that piece of paper in front of his face, “I'm an American.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">Not -- they never honored it, but she saved it all the way, and it could be her help, could be the fact that I just didn't feel like dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">I didn't feel like giving up and, and forgetting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">After all, I said to myself, “I, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">I have a bright future of me -- I had a bright future ahead of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">Why should I give up?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">Zest of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">I never gave up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1664">QUESTION:  And you thought you’d get through it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1665">ANSWER:  There were people that were quite desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">The man who was with us, he said, “I can't take it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">They're going to kill us, they’re going to -- ” when we were in hiding, when they were removing all that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and all those things from the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">He left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">Unfortunately he did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">I guess my fate is such that I should remain and be able to tell it as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">Q. Did you have any dreams at the time or -- ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">A. Maybe I did or maybe I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">I, I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">I'm sure I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">I am sure that nightmares were there, however, we were quite exhausted every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">That we were glad that we are able to sleep anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">I did have an -- occasionally nightmares, reliving what I -- my, my past, because when I applied to the -- I don’t know what they -- for the reparations to the German government, they gave me a lump sum of money for being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which was just a few hundred dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">When it came to disability, I had no physical disability, fortunately for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">They made me claim first physical disability, then I claimed mental disability. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">They gave me -- I don't remember what percentage and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">Then it went to a <span class="BUILDING">review court</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koln</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they rejected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">They said if the man could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> right after it, co-- go study in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , come here and get two degrees in engineering, where is his mental disability? </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">So, they rejected me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">So, I'm not getting anything, and I -- frankly I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">I don't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">I have made whatever I have I had made it myself and I don't need the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">In spite of the fact that it's a different generation, another generation, whatever it is, I still don't like them because I still think that they have not repented enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">They have benefited to an “nth” degree from what was stolen, what was confiscated, what was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">The property that my family owned in what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> , I am not trying to claim because I have no proof of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">People that were there are dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">They are not in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">There are no documents of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> everything was destroyed, burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">I have no proof of any kind, just testimonials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">And on the ba-- basis of testimonials of other people, nobody is going to give anybody anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">So, I'm not even trying it, and I'm not even doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">So, I have reconciled with the fact that I have to live with what I ha-- what I make and what I have made, and that's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">I am very happy with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">The money that I have gotten at that-- at one time, that lump sum, went towards a in a small, very small part, I took my family, my wife and the two children, and my son and daughter, and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , right after the '70 war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">Q. Anything else you want to add? </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">A. No, unless you want to ask me anything.</span></p>
