<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Please tell me your full name and where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My full name is William Luksenburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dombrova</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Was born on February the Ist, 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you were born in and about your family and your early recollections?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I was born in was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mining town</span> , <span class="DLF">coal mining</span> and smelters. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived, it was comparatively not as many Jews as other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around us, and we...at at that time I had a big family, father, mother, just older brothers, but the family from my mother's side and my father's side was quite...a family about fifty, sixty people, which only me and distant cousins...two cousins are alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and one in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and from my family I'm the only one left alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My recollection and my upbringing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dombrova</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I attended <span class="BUILDING">grade schools</span> which were run by, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we didn't have separation state and <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and therefore the <span class="BUILDING">Polish grade schools</span> were run by the Catholic lay teachers, nuns and priests, most of them...very few laymen teachers and I want to bring it out because we had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> on Saturdays, but me my parents being orthodox and we could not...my father would forbid us to attend <span class="BUILDING">Saturday schools</span> , and what happened that this...the that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday what we had they usually would take...they would take new subject on Saturday and I think it was because just in spite anti-Semitic overtones and anyway I would come in Monday back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My room teacher or my classmates would not let me in what was the 01:03: new subject on Saturday, so for me going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was very hard because by the time I rolled in by Friday I caught up only with the new subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Friday rolled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Saturday was a day off for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Also another thing...we had to attend mass every Sunday morning, the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We had our...1n uniform, the head it was shaving...the hair was shaved and we marched to to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every morning and of course the Jewish boys had to march too. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Of course we didn't go into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We...a few of us standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and that brought back memories I remember because we're like outcasts...the Jews and all, and said let us go, not to attend the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We were to attend the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday even though we stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Remembering some episodes in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...we had some singing lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had high priests coming sometimes visit our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , our prelate and they would...we would sing religious songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We had a teacher who played the fiddle, and he would...said sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He would play along as we were sang, and we...we sang the religious songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Well, I didn't feel like singing religious songs because I was not...I was brought up orthodox and I felt it was sacriligious to sing songs like that, but I kept my mouth 01:05: shut and he saw that I was not singing properly and he walked between the rows in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and then got behind me and hit me with his bow hard into my...on my head and he said, . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Will you Jew sing? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And something like this...it's kind of stands out in your mind and other episodes were as merchants and Pollack would stay in front of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and say . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Don't...don't buy from a Jew because they were...we were quite persecuted in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The upbringing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very hard for us Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Matter of fact when Hitler came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , he was very surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We were hardened by that because when...and during when Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a lot of the German Jews committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">When he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , although we had the same hard times, maybe harsher, but we were hardened people already and we didn't commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We just stood our ground and took it sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And otherwise I remember another incident when my mother was an educated woman and she had a lot of Polish friends because the...she was brought to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> with them and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">She make friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The reason I'm saying that why is during the war, during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...
QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit more about your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Well, my family...my my father was a merchant and I 01:07: described my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">She was educated woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">She had Russian matura which was a high education. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My older brother was a dentist and he...he went to <span class="BUILDING">dentistry school</span> and he had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> un <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He was very well to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I lost him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and we had an extended family where they were workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were merchants. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They were educators.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  And what did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  My father was a merchant. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He had leather and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about the Jewish life in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Well, Jewish life in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...we had a nice...quite a big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Also Jewish life centered in small, like at <span class="BUILDING">home synagogues</span> and my father was a...was a head, what they call Hachnoses Kalla. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That means he was the president where the young brides couldn't afford a dowry, so what they did they collected money different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They organized <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and so on and made extra money and then when some young woman wanted to get married and didn't have a dowry, they would come to that organization which called Hachnoses Kalla. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That means take care of brides in Hebrew, and they would give like 500 Zloty or that quite amount of big money they could not afford to get married, and therefore the bride had a dowry because those days it was hard for a young bride no matter how pretty she was to get married without a dowry, and that was a big plus for young maids to get married, and my mother, may her rest in peace, I...she was the head of WIZO and they were giving a lot of milk for..to poor children. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">01:09: They would come up to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my mother would give them a slip a paper to go to the milkman to issue free milk for the children, and they were quite... Jewish life was centered of course around the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and of course organizations like this with had <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , organized <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , and...
QUESTION:  Did you go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My father was an Orthodox Jew and my grandfather was orthodox and my grand-grandfather was orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My grand-grandfather lived to be a hundred and seven and he died right before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My grandparents died during the war, and so Jewish life really centered around the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Can you tell me you recollections, your first recollections of what happened when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Well, before the war broke out, there were news...newsreels and the paper wrote about the Germans, how they arm themselves and so and my mother always said well, those people arm themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There might be a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I remember the first day...September the Ist, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Since we were right...living right hard on the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , the German were right next few hours in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Being a young person, I went with all other young people to see those, because it's something like had never happened...something new happened in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we did not expect anything that horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The soldiers stood around and passing around even some candy to the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was a little older than a child then, and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and didn't think much but, you know, was something such a terrible thing and I remember them Polish soldiers before they're walking back from the front and carrying those heavy backpacks and our army, the Polish army, wasn't at all motorized with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and they were already surprised because the German army surprised them, went ahead faster than they can run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  When did things begin to change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  The things began to change right the first night. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The first night there were blackouts all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They would have a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">After dark, nobody's supposed to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The first memorable night is was when I...when some of our neighbors tried to...a young man tried to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he didn't realize just crossing the <span class="DLF">street</span> would...would breach the curfew and a German soldier said:" halt," and he kept on running and he got machine gunned all the way across and he fell right in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so the Germans started yelling, all the men 'raus, all the men 'raus to help carry the body in and made me carry the body with four other persons and because the way he was machine-gunned, he was completely like cut in half. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">When I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was completely covered with blood, and I remember when I got into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my mother looked at me completely colorless something...such an awful thing to see first time...I was just absolutely covered with blood and I always remember my mother's expression and my mother's fear and my mother cry out when she saw me completely covered with blood and that was the first night, the first expression what was...we didn't know what's coming and it was a horrible thing the first night. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Well, weeks later and we had all kinds new ordinances. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We...we had to give up our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electrical appliances</span> , radios of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Radios unless you had a radio was...you could...you could go up to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a long time or even be killed right away, on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">There were...we have to...we have to give up our furs. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We have to give up our silver, gold, whatever valuables, and of course we were rationed and the right first week you could see women, children on the <span class="DLF">street</span> without food, without medical care and then institute now our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where all the Jews living out in outlying areas had to come in and we happened to be in the part where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And from our...we had four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and other people live in our three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and our <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...my parents said we're going to live in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , but you know, everybody had to share and so we decided our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We had a big...quite a big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But whatever it was, we all stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">A lot of people dying and a lot of people were...and surviving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  How did these changes make you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Well, as a young person, I in the beginning I was still...as a young person you kind of take it a little bit lightly in the beginning but I felt very uncomfortable and I kept on talking to my mom, to my parents...what's going to be...what's going to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And we were completely cut off from news. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We really didn't know what...what happened in the world, but my mother would say well the world can't stand still and see something like this happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Something's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And then they were taking young people to...to work...to work camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And my older brother never been <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he wanted to see the world and he was already a professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He volunteered to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he wanted to see the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He was a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He wanted to see the world but he didn't realize that he really volunteered going to aa working arm (ph) camp, but him being a dentist, he had it relatively well. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">He wrote letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">In the beginning we could get letters from him and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Later on everything stopped of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And my mother took it very hard because my brother was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there were a lot of young people still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">You know how a mother feels. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And slowly we've seen what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">A lot of people were dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">A lot of people were...then they start like grabbing people off the <span class="DLF">street</span> and put them...send them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , so then you felt like you were a hunted animal because being a young man, you were the first to be grabbed and sent out, and then the...what would happen, we would...the German made us organize special <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> for the war effort and they would then they were given cards like for German war effort you got like a blue card and a lesser job which wasn't such a war effort was a yellow card and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So when you got later on caught on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the the people who would catch you would...at that time they even organized a Jewish militia. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The Germans did not want to get in and do that dirty work. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They organized a Jewish militia and they come up to the Jewish head of the Jewish militia and say we need tonight so many hundred people...two hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">You deliver. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I guess during the war a lot of people want to save themselves and their families, so whoever want to be militiamen, he felt that he can save his family being transported out that fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They have special privileges, so the militiamen would come in, knock at your <span class="DLF">door</span> , and try to find you and then you start hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You're hiding in the attic. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You're hiding somewhere, so...
QUESTION:  Were you hiding? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Did you have to hide?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Well, in the beginning I had to hide but later on I start to work in one <span class="BUILDING">establishment</span> who had a blue card, and it was for the German war effort, were making backpacks and so on for the German army, so whenever they would catch me and they would see the blue card, they would release me where somebody who didn't have a blue card would get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And there was a terrible terrible time that time and you...you'd go up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and you see the people without food and people dying and young children on the <span class="DLF">street</span> crying and then a lot of people were without parents already or who had died from disease because the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was crammed in like 1n two <span class="DLF">streets</span> and the conditions were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We might have gotten ration food, like a thousand calories a day for a person which was...and the bread was almost not edible, and then you had to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> for the bread even though you had the coupons and I remember I did not want my father to stay, because I was afraid for them so I would get up like two o'clock in the morning and get in front of the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> would open up like nine, ten o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They were never in a hurry to open up because the customers were there just the same, so you stayed from about two o'clock in the morning till the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> opened up and you got the ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">You bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">As a young child I had responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I didn't want my parents, my father especially, to stay in the <span class="DLF">line</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  How old were you at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  This time I was sixteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I...to a certain extent I felt responsible at least with the bread and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I...then a lot of people would would think going out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and get up on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and I I speak very well Polish and a lot of people would speak Polish with a Jewish accent and I I spoke very well Polish and I would qualify to go as an Aryan paper and they had 01:20: some connections where you pay money and you you get different name, so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You keep on repeating over and over again a different name and my family...
QUESTION:  Your family was able to arrange this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  To arrange this...yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I remember coming...coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the last time to say goodbye, and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to say goodbye to my mom and she was just beside herself so she felt I'm leaving...she's never going to see me again and she decided where she would not allow me. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">She said what ever's going to happen to you, it's going...go to us, going to happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">At that time we did not realize...we didn't realize how bad the situation was and what's going to happen to us, and she just completely disregarded and we went so much trouble to get those papers, and I did not go out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But I remember my mother really carrying on...crying over me and I remember my mother's face, the way she cried and the way she hugged me and she kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">When I say that I feel like a young person against my mother now, I don't feel that kind of age difference now and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I remember my mother's face during my my ordeal throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> , and even up today and the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I remember my mother's face when I first came up...when I was covered with blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I remember my mother's face that time when I came on the Aryan papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My mother had a lot of...as I mentioned before, had a lot of gentile friends, Polish 01:22: friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">She went to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> with them and during that ordeal we were really starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">There was no rations and one day my mother said why don't you go out because I took my arm band off...yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I forgot to mention we had to wear our arm bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Later on we had our yellow Star of David...one in the front and one in the back so when you go in the back you can recognize that you're Jewish too, not just in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">She said why don't you take...at that time we wear arm band...she said why don't your arm band off. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">By the way, if you...if they caught you without an arm band and you are a Jew, you could be shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">That was a death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I took my arm band off and I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">You know, there was a lot of open <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> all where they go through the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and I went to her best friends, name was , and my mother said...they had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> ...why don't you go...I'm sure...she's my friend...she'll give you some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Well, I came over and I knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they wouldn't even let me through the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They said we don't have any bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I remember coming back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and again my mother was so disappointed that her best friend wouldn't give her child a loaf of bread, because she was sure they had lots of it and again I remember my mother then had disappointment and she was crying over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was...had gotten to be so unbearable people would...would get up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and and almost live on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and there were terrible times and then we all realized it was really their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">In 1942 they had all the people gather into a <span class="BUILDING">sports arena</span> on the threat of that anybody be found at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> would be shot on the spot and people would put on their Sunday best, very best, and they go out with...they not really know what to expect but when when you...nothing good would come out that they want us out there, and I remember we went over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> where the German sat and he made right and left, "rechts und links". </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I went this way and my parents went and I never see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The only thing I got from my mother...she left a note for me through one of these militias to deliver to me where she described where we had hidden some valuables...where we had...and that was my last letter from my mother, and they were sent out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> directly because at that time they were old people.

</span><span class="sentence" id="189">We were in very close proximity from from . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Then it was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> not even a half hour or three-quarters of an hour ride, so knowing that by Wednesday they might take him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I dug out where my mother's left me the note we have our

</span><span class="sentence" id="203">And I wanted...and I kept on looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> , thinking about jumping out and every time I kept on looking down, I I seen the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> further down rather than closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I...then I've seen the day break and I thought to myself, if I'm going to jump, now or never, and without thinking I just went over the side and I pushed myself and I jumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Now the fear was so great because it was curfew and I knew I had some relations about five, six block down the <span class="DLF">road</span> and I was running real fast and on the way I was thinking that I'll go down the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and hide after the curfew because the <span class="DLF">front doors</span> were always locked, and they might let me in, but I remember coming into the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">There were like ten, twelve <span class="DLF">stairs</span> going like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">There...most of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> had like a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> where they kept potatoes and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I started walking down and I couldn't 01:34: walk down. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I fell all the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> down because my left leg was completely swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And in the morning they heard me and picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Now what they did...I was a fugitive so they put me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> was like a thin attic. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It was about maybe five foot high and it was so hot and I was completely stripped naked and I was just fainting and sometimes I took a rag in my own urine and I put it over my head to cool off. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It was unbearable and they...they must have been fearing for their safety and they came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They say you have to leave because we are afraid to keeping you here any longer, so I got dressed and I put my arm band and I went...took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> where my brother was laying there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  How did you get to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> without my arm band and went back, and I was glad to see him and he needed somebody to take care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He was just laying there but you have to go out and get something to eat or, you know, we would...either we'd sell our clothes...whatever was valuable you'd trade and sell and money...there was no more money left and I was a fugitive and I was recognized again and they...they caught me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">This time I put in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I was there I don't remember how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I can't tell because it was solitary and it was always night and then they...to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> I was directly, separately carried on and was transport going...they took me and attached me to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">01:36:

<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  This was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> they were building a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , SO we were put to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The work consisted of twelve hours a day, and you cannot rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You start with a shovel from the first minute on up and the man stays over you whether whether he got a handle from a broken shovel or some kind of bat and hit you constantly over the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The first day, we were carrying so many dead people where they would mostly die from beatings and so on and when I got back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , I ne...I was...I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I never held a shovel for so many...ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But the first twelve hours when I got back, my hands were full of blisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Not only had blisters here. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I had blisters between my fingers and I felt if I go next day, I won't be able to hold nare a feather, not just a shovel and work twelve hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And I spotted...they had some women in the in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and one was...my brother was older from me, seven years older so he he had some friends and I spotted her and I came...she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ...and I said to her, Lola. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I said look at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I will not survive tomorrow one day cause I cannot work. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I would like to, and it was lucky for me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I always happened to be very fortunate that she had some pull and put me on a <span class="INT_SPACE">sick room</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krankenstube</span> where they made, falsified that I had fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The only time you could stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick room</span> if you had fever, and I stayed there for a few days and they bandaged my hand and put some grease and she managed to give me a job when I got back. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They were looking for steamroller operator and me being...I always had a knack for mechanics and I was...and when I came up and I told the man that I would like to learn, he...and it didn't take me long and I was rolling this steamroller that that's why I was at a cushy job. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I remember I was driving that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamroller</span> down the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It was a very heavy big equipment and it was an old piece of equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It didn't have up-to-date hydraulic brakes, had mechanical brakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I'm trying to making a right turn going down <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I've been pushing hard with my foot to the brake. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I've been trying to make the right turn at the same time and I couldn't do it because the the the weight of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamroller</span> was greater than I can hold with my my foot and instead of making a right turn, I went straight, and I pulled down the the <span class="DLF">curb</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ...just completely flattened 1t out. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">When the German...there was a civilian German...he he got angry and he took the shovel and he broke the shovel on the side of the wheel and he kept on hitting me and the soldier stood there with a gun just waiting for me to try to make some kind of move when he would kill me, so all I could do is just put my arms over my head and protect myself being hit so many times over my head, and he kept on hitting me so long till he got tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I almost lost my eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I had a big gash over my head and got my teeth...front teeth knocked out and a big cut in my lip and I...next day I went back to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I couldn't see my front eye, my left eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It's funny...the episodes what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Then the people everyday coming in from from work detail and the prisoners would bring other dead prisoners every single day into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your living conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Did you...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">One big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> could contain about a hundred and some people, and we'd get up early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Again we'd get counted and we'd get a black whatever it was, like coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We'd go out on detail work. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We'd get beaten by the guards, by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> , and you you go out on work detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Again you get beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">On on the work at lunchtime you get like a seaweed soup...just brown soup with some seaweeds in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">At night, we get a square piece of bread like that and the bread you could not eat like a bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was made like a clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Every time you eat, you take a bite, you have to...you have to kind of remove it. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The bread it stick to your the roof of your mouth because stuck like clay and Sunday used to get a little small piece of margarine and sometimes a spoonful of meat, and in the beginning when we left there were still some people left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when I was there, so they had like a that you could put a piece of bread into an envelope and treat it as such and mail it, like an envelope, and some people who had parents would send...would take a dried piece of bread and put in 01:48: envelope like and send it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I remember in the beginning we used to get some mail like this, right in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The reason I'm saying that because I knew I didn't have anybody <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore and I would sit and stare, you know, go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> looking at the other guys getting some...something from the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I would never even go...expect anybody to send me, because I didn't have any parents anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">That was 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">But then that stopped because they they liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">There was...there was some Polish people who were in forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They had to work but they could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They would tell us now there's no more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It's all liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We would...sometimes some Polish people would get paid by our parents to bring some letters <span class="BUILDING">home</span> while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was there and they would bring them back to us, but then we heard the news there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">There was complete liquidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And after the steamroller job, the <span class="DLF">road</span> finished, we built a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , fairly big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which was called Deutsche Gas(aus?)werke. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We were manufacturing raw material for tires and it's like soot. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It's carbon. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It's a black carbon which was manufactured and packed in like cement bags and and then they needed mechanics to to build the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and then I was leaving there again and they needed welders so I became a welder. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Just...I just could pick up anything and I was a welder and we were building the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That was 1943 that we became part of the Auserkommando under 01:50: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The SS came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We all got stripped naked and we all got tattooed. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Completely naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Men, women separate of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The being tattooed...it's not the pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The pain is just to being branded like a like an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It's it's a it's a terrible thing to think that you don't have a name anymore, that you are being branded. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">That was a...quite a shock for all of us, especially...we had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> separate, and I understand there was much more of a shock for for young women standing in front of the SS completely stripped naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">After...well, after we built the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> I stayed with that for quite a while and I said well, then I I counted some some Germans who who were sent from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to run the the building of the of this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and certain specifications and I remember I was sitting in the corner and I was at that time welding pipes. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I would...the the master would...call him master...he's overhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He would eat and then he...at the time he would feel sorry because he saw me all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I was there twelve hours with no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He would...sort of afraid to give you a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">He would point with the eye whatever he left or he couldn't eat and he would lay it down and he walked out and I would I would get a piece of bread, because he saw that I would try and I worked and I also been sometimes in there I was a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Then after this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was built up, they needed prime mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We had big like Toledo scales where we would weigh that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...I want to describe the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the condition we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">In order to produce the carbon soot, it had to be a certain temperature on the...in the in the <span class="DLF">factory grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">It had to be like between a hundred to hundred ten degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">If 1t got cooler, the machine would not produce as as much soot, carbon than it's hotter hotter temperature, and we would get stuck with clothes like you would freeze and there were people who wouldn't and I don't think and not being a prisoner like we were, and free work...could work without having a mask on their face, and a lot of people would die from lung diseases because we were spitting out...we'd we'd come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We were completely black and the women got some soap but the men hardly got any soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">You could scrub your...your body was hurting just from scrubbing your your body just with a brush without any soap, but then they they needed prime mechanics for those scales. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">There were like the big Toledo scales where we would weigh the production, the the soot and I volunteered that I I will repair this. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">What happened those scales would get stopped up by the 01:54: accumulation of carbon and I was issued a lot of tools and an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric car</span> so I would pick up from one part of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to the other and bring it to my <span class="INT_SPACE">workshop</span> and clean them and put them back in place. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I worked twelve hours a day, twelve hours a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">One day I noticed they built a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">grounds factory</span> for the Germans and they unloaded a truckload of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I remember driving by in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It smelled so sweet like, like you go to te best <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It smelled that good to me, so the next shift at nighttime I decided to go inspect the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> where the potatoes were. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I thought maybe some potatoes would drop down accidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I would pick up and there was a big <span class="DLF">iron door</span> with a big padlock. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I put the padlock in my hand and I looked at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and I made a key. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I wanted to eat, something to eat, and to my biggest surprise I opened up that lock and I just got in on the first try, just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I opened the heavy <span class="DLF">door</span> and (sniffing) took that deep breath and the next day I told my buddies from work...I said hey, we're going to get some potatoes, so we took some empty bags from cement and we loaded them. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But you don't think and you don't realize that if one eats and other people, hungry people know it, everybody got to eat, so I couldn't hide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Everybody worked in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> had to go get the potatoes at night because if I would not let them, then they would tell on me and I wouldn't have anything, so first night we went like twenty of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Next night went thirty of us and load potatoes, sneaked out one by one, so the Germans noticed that the heap got to be smaller, so one night I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they planted SS and they caught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I got beaten on the... by the SS Wacht Stube, then come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the big appell. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I got on my naked behind beaten twenty-five with the bullwhip. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The first three, the man hit you as hard as a man can hit you. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">The first three whips...that's all you feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Later...later on it's just like novocaine. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">You can hit a hundred times. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You don't feel any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">It was ___ when the bullwhip goes around here and hits you right here, and I was all bloodied up from hard hitting and I remember they dragged me. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I could not walk and all these guys who I helped carried potatoes, they carried...they had cold compresses putting on me to to keep me cool and the next day I had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I literally would not...could not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They actually picked me up and dragged me to to to work next day, and when I came in, my my German master saw me and since I had a cushy job he let me there stay a few days, but that was a bad experience because I couldn't walk, I couldn't bend down for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">A matter of fact, this small piece of margarine we used to get on Sunday, all my buddies donated and put it on on my skin so my skin would kind of soften up. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Had a big scar. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">That's one of the things you have to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Also there were constant beatings and you had a krankenstube, a <span class="INT_SPACE">sick room</span> , where for anybody would get sick again they would once a week come in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and load these people straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  We're going to take a break now, change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Why don't you continue telling me what you were telling me before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  I want to also mention that besides being hungry and work hard, we also had a lack of vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">All of us had those terrible boils all over your body...big boils on the arms, all over your knees, so on, which was very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I want to mention we had a French doctor who they pressed into as a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He he didn't have any medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He would cut open the boil, clean it and then all he had is like toilet paper, would wrap it up, and then you you just make first move and it breaks and falls off on you, and you go into such a dirty work with open wounds...we all had a lot of wounds because of lack of vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">That was another, another hardship we we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">No medical treatment whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">If you had a toothache or something like this was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">He had a layman pull tooth...a tooth without any, any kind of pain killers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">During my imprisonment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> , I had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric car</span> where I was transporting those scales and the women would work on at service those machines, Jewish women prisoners, and I had...I I was the only one from the from the few men...I could talk to Jewish girls which was a...and I would befriend my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We talked once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We would get...talked with hands or would write a big letter, take a big bag from the from the cement and write a big love letter and throw it over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> to each other, and it gave a little bit of sparkle to your life and that you talked to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We never touched...could never touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">God forbid if you would. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">It would be a death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">But I would drive by and talk to her on the side and she would smile and talk to me and it would kind of felt like we were for each other but not in...and I would write her love letters and maybe someday we'll...which I I believe I didn't believe that we would live the war through 02:03: because we used to get some scraps of newspapers, German papers, that the the German people would throw out their food into the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">During the war you wrap all the food in old newspapers, and I would understand some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The Germans were winning the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Not only this, I remember they would describe that they had shot down so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Allied planes</span> and all their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would come back, and of course already went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they and they were doing good in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and also there was like a death sentence from what I read, from the scraps of paper, they were doing very well and they they were winning the war and just like a death sentence because you know if they if they're winning the war, sooner or later you'll have to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And many times I would lay on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span> and I would try to picture myself how I'm going to die, what's going to be like, and then I would say to myself, maybe I won't die. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I'll keep on fighting it as much as I can, and for a young person it's a horrible feeling to have like a death sentence, not knowing what's going to be and especially we did not have no inkling that how how the war was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">That was 1943 and I understand after the war that the Russians, they had such a great victory over the Germans and we didn't have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">In 1943 when the Germans were loosing on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and so on, they took us, took more revenge on the Jews than ever before, what I read after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I...I...and continues like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz prison camp</span> for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">A lot of people die. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">A lot of people were sick, were driven off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I kept on, continued writing letters and seeing my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">At one time an incident...on Sunday we'd get close to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">There was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> separate us, and I would speak to her from far away and then the Wachte, the soldier would see us and then we would run away into respective <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and the head, the German head of the compound, went on the German, on the <span class="BUILDING">women's barracks</span> and he wanted to know who was seeing the Maenner, and nobody came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Well, then he said, if nobody comes up, every tenth girl is going to get...the women had some hair, short, but they didn't had their hair shaven completely, so he said every tenth girl going to have her head shaven for punishment, so my wife thought why some women who never went up, talked to a man, why should they have their heads shaven so she volunteered, and she came up...yes, I have been the one that spoke to the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And to show him that...to show the other girls that she was so brave, he said because you came up so brave, you go back out. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You're not going to get your head shaven, and then he took every tenth girl and got her head shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The next morning we were...the girls were working three times eight hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We worked twelve hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">The women worked eight hour shifts, so sometimes we would pass each other coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and other and I I wasn't sure whether... didn't know whether they had her hair shaven or not because they were all wearing scarves over over their heads because the work, it was so...the girls who did not, did have their head shaven, they would put a piece of hair just in front of it to show they had some hair, and I wasn't sure whether my friend at that time had had her hair shaven or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Later on I found out she was the 02:07: brave one. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">She volunteered and then she didn't get her head shaven, and the women had the same problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Women weren't as severely beaten as the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The men were cruelly beaten for any chance worth giving, for any reason, by the guards, by the we had...by the Germans who were criminals or homosexuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They always had the high status in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> as Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They were beaten by them, and and so life was miserable and we didn't know what what really was going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">What we didn't know in 1945 that the war was really coming to the end and one day was announcement that we should...1f want to the ...the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where they kept the clothes and food and so on, if you want to get...all we want to take all the bread we can carry, all the clothes we can put on...they open up the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and then they line us up on the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We're marching out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> and then unknown to us, the Russians were about two days away. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We didn't have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We were marching and I remember the first night there was a...we wind up in a big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was a very dark night, and I heard from far away noise, noises from women, so I figured my girlfriend must be there, so I plough on through, stepping on all kinds of people and everybody cursing and so on, and I finally found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It was January 1945, very cold, and everybody had his own bread tucked away and make like a little bag out of towels and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Today's today's wife, sitting there, she lost all her bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">She was sitting there and she was just helpless like, so I did...I split up my bread in half. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I said now don't loose it anymore, and ___ and I said be careful and see what's going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">After walking a few days, they decided put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">At that time, afterwards we knew it that a lot of people were...same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport trains</span> were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">What happened is the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was overrun by the Allied armies, and they didn't want us to fall into their hands, so they kept us away...I don't know...they didn't know what really what to do with us, just away from the Allied's hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Then we were put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and my wife happened to see which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I was in and happened to be the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> next to ours was for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">women train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">The women were separate and the men were separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And we were driven all the way across <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , but I must say that the Czech people were very brave about wherever we drove over <span class="DLF">overpass</span> , they would stay and would throw bread, and it was very dangerous for them because there would be...the German soldiers would shoot at those people throwing bread at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Well, I I was always trying to figure out better way how to build a better mousetrap, so I got on on the side the the open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> so I'll be higher than everybody else, and I would catch my bread in mid-air and then I went over and I want to share that bread with my girlfriend, today's wife, and you can't just break the bread and throw it over to the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , say give it to Helen. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">You have to deliver it in your own hands, otherwise they'll never see the bread, so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving and I went over to the side and I say you stretch your arm out. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I want to make sure...throw the bread over to to her so she gets it personally and we stayed for a while practicing, make sure she catches it and I threw the bread and she didn't catch it and it was quite a loss, something like this, and it means...means a lot to give...that time when you're that hungry to give half the bread to somebody you really care for.</span></p>

ANSWER:  On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , we got loaded up again wall to wall, standing room only. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">When you're on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> without sleep so many days, you're standing up and your knees are bending. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">You're half asleep, but you're afraid to lay down because you get tramped by others. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">When you're like this, you you...one human being doesn't care about the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">You just step over. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You...when you lay down, you never get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They...people just stamp over you, everybody just like in a transfixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">You know, when you loose your sleep, you loose complete like consciousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You stay and your knees keep on bending completely back and forth but you are holding on when you're afraid to fall asleep and we'd dri...driven on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> for about two weeks in January '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">All we had is blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Lucky for us, that we had some snow falling and then you would gather one from another's blanket snow...that was...at least we had something to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Was...otherwise you ...it's very hard to be without food, but it's much harder to be without water. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And by the time, you know, we're driving...people were dying with...whoever died they were thrown overboard. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">By the time we came to the destination which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> , there weren't too many people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I like... want to describe the first time we realized that the Germans...Germans are losing the war, we were driving in our open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> right through the heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and we saw all the destruction and we didn't believe our own eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Finally we seen that the Germans really are getting what's coming to them and there were big slogans...we're going to fight to the last drop of blood, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We went...few people who were left on the on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> were embracing each other, who couldn't believe that really Germans really got something in return for our for our pain, for our...... We were unloaded in the big <span class="INT_SPACE">hangars</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">There was <span class="BUILDING">aircraft factory</span> and aircraft hangars and because the Allies bombed them every day, the the <span class="INT_SPACE">hangars</span> , the <span class="DLF">roof</span> is all made out of glass and there was one single pane of glass left...all knocked out and we were laying on the concrete with the water and snow on sheer concrete and water and I I lost so much weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I I must have been way down and I had...I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I had diarrhea and I was laying in that wet...on the wet <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , snow on the concrete, and I thought 02:15: this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I really gave up and I felt so cold and I was so sick and then I heard a voice calling me, and there was my friend who I slept with in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gletwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">He was a barber and being a barber, he...apparently he cut some hair for the SS and they gave him some scrap of food, and he picked me up and he saw that I was already on my...laying there and dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">He took my clothes off and he cleaned me up and he gave me a dry pair of pants and he brought me a hot bowl of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">When I drunk the soup like somebody gave life into me. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I felt so so different, and I gained some confidence, some more strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We were there for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Again we were marched back and forth and carrying stuff back and forth and beatings and and there were...they had some...at that time they had some non-Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They would stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and the Jews had to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and being marched back and forth and and ran around the back, just just to torture us, but when you...at that time, you're just like numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You exist but you really don't...don't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">To a certain extent you're just like punchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You don't care and you...you're just not a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">You're stripped from everything and it was just...you weren't thinking much more than just...you you had a pain in your stomach and you were cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I remember laying and dreaming if I would ever be a free man, all I wanted to have is a hot glass of tea with a big loaf of bread, cut very thick slice, and I would just drink the hot tea and eat the bread, one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">That was my biggest dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">After I got liberated I never done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I...after...from...when we were on...off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , when we were unloaded first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> ...I want to come back...when I got down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we were...all snow was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">You know, I've seen all that snow and I was yearning to catch a little bit, so I stood there and picked up a handful of snow and put it in my mouth, and at that they marched the women by and that's the first...last time I saw my future wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">She said, don't eat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">You're going to sick, 02:18: like I would care. (</span><span class="sentence" id="478">Laughter) And that's the first...last time I saw her till after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , we got loaded up again in open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> and driven to unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">After a few days we arrived in that terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp Flossenburg</span> , which 1s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">That's at top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">There were <span class="DLF">stone quarries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">There were so many people...all a lot of nationalities...Russian, and any kind...Greek and you could hear all languages, and we were laying on <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">It was very cold and there was no food at all, so one day I walked by and I have seen some Russian carrying big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> with food and I saw them going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> carrying to somebody, so next morning I got up real early, like three o'clock, and I followed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">What they did they were carrying food for the German guards but while they're carrying the food, they would open up the kettle and everybody had their little pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Everybody hang it on the string...they would dip in. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So I went with them carrying it and they would dip in. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I would dip in too, but since you are afraid to carry it for a long time, you have to consume it right away and that soup was so hot and I drunk it, being hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It's like swallowing a flame. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">As hungry as I was, I could not eat for a few days because all my <span class="NPIP">inside</span> was burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The piece of small bread I was given once in twenty-four hours, I could not eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I would hold it in my...behind my shirt because my...my whole <span class="NPIP">inside</span> was completely burnt. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> was one of the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and I knew this was going to be my last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I never expected to live through that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">There were beatings daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">There were hangings daily, and I could smell the burned flesh. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They had...when you get up in the morning, you go to the <span class="BUILDING">wash barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They would take all the corpses, un...undress them and they were laying down like a collection in the <span class="BUILDING">wash barrack</span> and they would take the number here, tattoo it big letters across the chest so they can check them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">When you get up in the morning, you go to the <span class="BUILDING">wash barrack</span> , you step over some corpses and you wash your face and they had like a big row, just one faucet and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">urn</span> like to wash, and because the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> was too small, they would...down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> they would burn it completely, and the stench of burned flesh was always in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You would smell it completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It's a nauseating smell, and you would see the smoke rising from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It was like down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> , down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> like...day and night it was a terrible smell and it was an awful thing to live through, and I I was down so much that I I thought I'm not going to live through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">It's so cold, so they send me to work...one day they sent to me to work at the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It had long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> running on on rail, like railroad, small <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> , narrow ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They would load the stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">You would go down the 02:22 <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">You step on...you ride down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Then on bottom of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> to get out of the way, you had to jump out and pull the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> out of the way because next one 1s coming, depends on how much weight they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Some of them went further. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Some of them went shorter and the next prisoner to me, I don't know why he got away or from me and I could not push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> far enough from the next one coming not to hit me and I got hit from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , and I broke my ribs, got mine smashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I remember I come...I came into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">My whole side was swollen and I was loosing consciousness and I'm coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I was like on pins and needles and I was...they took me out in the morning to work and I...and I was in such terrible pain and I...somehow or other I lived through, endured, and the swelling went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I put some cold compresses and I endured it. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I used to put some...when I went on the on the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> , I used to take some paper and put it under my...under my jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I only had a jacket and a pair of pants to keep warm, and I used to take paper and wrap around your wooden shoes, but when you get back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , you had to take it off because they check you and you cannot have anything under you, only just your jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They want to make you that you stay cold because the the paper did keep you warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The paper in the morning is stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">By the time you get through all day long, it's nice and soft already and we had to take it off and get cold again. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And I knew that this is going to be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It was very hard, and one day they were looking for strong men, and I figure I got to get out from there, so there were a lot of clothes what they took off from the 02:24 people who had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They were laying on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I put on about three coats and I got in <span class="DLF">line</span> and I blow my cheeks and they look at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Strong... had three coats on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I looked like a strong man and they picked me to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , but I remember (cough) we were fourteen days on an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagon</span> with no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I had seen some empty bottles so I ran away from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and I grabbed two bottles, fill them with water and stuff them in my...behind my belt and I come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> left already. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">After the war I found out that that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was put in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , was torched. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Poured gasoline and torched and whoever was trying to escape got machine gunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">That's another just sheer luck in the chain of my survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I really believe maybe my mother was there watching over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> I volunteered and went up. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We wind up 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">They put us on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in a in an old <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We slept one next to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Went marching every morning to work on the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where the Americans 02:26: would at that time bomb every single day the railroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">That was the main <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , and we would fill the the craters with dirt and carry the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and we would march and a lot of people would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">A lot of people would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">When you're a prisoner, you learn to tell the time by the sun and just about noon time the Americans, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would come very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">You could see just a tiny little spot in the...up in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> and they would make like a wide smoke circle and then they would throw bombs, and I would...after a while you would learn from the from the noise the bomb...which way the bomb, how close you're going to get it or how far you're going to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">You hear that whistle...far or closer. (</span><span class="sentence" id="544">whistling sound) And I would...you would hear too close...I would run that way or the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">You learn by experience, and I would run on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and the one bomb fell next to me and I got half-way buried with dirt, and I been screaming and yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Some other guys would pull me up, but I left one shoe <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and on that shoe I I was mourning so much because I could not walk without shoes and it was a big loss just to lose that one shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Later on I retrieve from somebody who who I found laying there dead and I put the shoes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Laying there in the in the (sniff) <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , we were completely covered with lice, you know, laying with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We didn't have any kind of hygiene or any kind of water to wash for so many weeks and we were completely overrun with lice that our flesh were eaten with lice and you couldn't get rid of it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There was no, nothing provided for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">When we were marching, everybody been trying to march next to the <span class="DLF">curb</span> because as much the Germans didn't have cigarettes, they smoke up to a little small stump, so when sometimes the wind would blow the stumps next to the <span class="DLF">curb</span> and you would pick up that stump and I found this can from shoe polish and I would loosen it up and put it in there and sometimes I would find a piece of newspaper or a piece from a telephone book like, fine paper, and I would get up in that <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> like three o'clock in the morning when everybody would sleep and I would roll up a big cigarette and that was my biggest pleasure and I would smoke that cigarette and one day I came in and a big, big guy...kapo, a German prisoner also...he smelled it and he came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Not only he took the cigarette away from me, I got a terrible beating from him, not...I don't know all the reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He just took, took his anger for some reason out on me because I was...I was brave enough to get up three o'clock in the morning and smoke a cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">There was a buddy system (cough). </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We would sleep two, because everybody had one blanket and it was cold, so if you find...you always find somebody, a buddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">It was always the buddy system. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Nobody would walk alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">You always go together, two. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">When you sleep you put one blanket under you and the other blanket you cover both of us and from breathing you keep warm that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">One night I was...I don't know who the person is...all I knew is that he was another prisoner and I slept and then I touched him, and he died right sleeping with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And although I've seen so many people die around me, that was a terrible experience that I slept with somebody that died right next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And next morning I was standing alone and somebody else looked for for buddy system and we would pair up again and we walked together. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Just unknown...just anybody...just being together. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">After a few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , apparently the Allies must have been pushing, unknown to us...we were we were marching nights and I guess the reason they didn't want to go daytime maybe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would spot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We would sleep whenever we would stop close by...in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> or whatever and work, walk nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">My feet were swollen so I couldn't take my shoes anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I was afraid...be afraid take my wooden shoes off because the swelling was over...like over-flowing my shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I would not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I 02:31: would slide my feet going back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I remember one...one night we pulled...in the night we pulled in into a farmer's big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We came to this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">There was a lot of rotten potatoes laying there...real rotten...and they were all running to it, starting eating those potatoes, and the farmer's woman could never see how a human being could eat stuff like this, so they shoved it away from us and as they said they're going to give us some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And I remember hearing from far away she was arguing with the SS that she want to feed us and they wouldn't let us to feed us, but finally she won and they they boiled the potatoes, you know, and peeled, and they were peeling it, and the farmer stood there with a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pan</span> and gave everybody a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pan</span> full of boiled potatoes and she would stay with a big loaf of bread and cut a big loaf of bread and give everybody a slice of bread, and I guess the woman never seen human beings like this because even being German, she stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">She had tears in her eyes and gave everybody a big slice of bread, because she'd never seen human beings like that, but the...I'd like to describe the condition of the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When you march, and most of us would...couldn't hardly walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We just keep on going like pushing our feet, sliding. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">For myself, I had my feet swollen and I knew the end was going to be soon because I I just could not walk anymore and I was walking like my nerves were carrying me. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I was 02:33: just, just going like this and the way you march is when you look around, you find yourself to be the last one in the column. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">You don't want to be the last one because you get the last one, you mostly get shot, so you push forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">You constantly without anybody prodding you...we were moving fast because nobody wanted to be the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">The minute you look around and you find yourself the last in the column, you go beyond everybody, push forward, till you fall back again, and me being so emancipated and couldn't walk anymore, every time I heard a shot...you heard shots all night long...I would have instinctively such a...in...instinctively such a reflex because I felt...1 was like like an animal...I felt it's going to be me next. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And as I walked my wooden shoes...somehow or other my feet got...hit each other and I fell, and I closed my eyes and nothing happened and I look out of the corner of my eyes and I've seen the column walking down the...down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and I I felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">My feet, they couldn't carry me. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I was laying there on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> in the snow and I could...could have died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I felt real good. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I was at peace with myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I didn't have to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And apparently in in the morning a farmer walked by...must have heard me moaning...and he picked me up, put me on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">the wagon</span> and brought me into this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The German tried to feed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They gave me milk and piece of bread with a pad of butter on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I couldn't drink milk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And I...and the funny thing 1s they would open up the <span class="DLF">barn door</span> and they would ask other women to come to see human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I was sitting there and I had a beard from January and that was May. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Never shaven, never cleaned and I must have been about sixty-five, seventy-five, seventy pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They would open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they took one look at me and they would cry and close the <span class="DLF">door</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Well, fortunate for me the American Army, 6th Army came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Next day I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Right hard on the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The time was...the town name was Lebanau (?)</span><span class="sentence" id="601"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bei Laufen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Next day the Americans came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the farmer took me back in and they brought me to the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Now, anybody who didn't live through being eaten alive by lice will not understand that but when I came to the American, they undressed me and they threw DDT and like the whole world stood still. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I must go back, because when I came to the farmer, they took my...my striped jackets out...off, and they gave me some...some of their civilian clothes and they buried it'1t_ was so infested with lice, but I remember when they put me back me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> to carry me to the Americans, I took like a visual picture of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> because when I was lib...liberated later on I came back and I...and I retrieved my pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Had the German woman dig out my pants and boil it <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I
