<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I need you to start off by telling me your name, when and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Susan Beer and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in May 14th, 1924, just celebrated couple days ago my birthday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Your name at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My name was at the time Suzanna Eisdorfer, I got much shorter now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your life before the war, you, did you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The reason I was born actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , my mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and her entire family lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She moved to this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topolcany</span> , after she got married and my father decided as a young, poor doctor it's much easier to start life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">But then she didn't want to give birth in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the medical establishment wasn't just up to date and she wanted to be with her family, so I was just a month old then, I was taken back to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , but it still shows that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and, well, actually 1t was very bad for me when it was time to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because the quota for Hungarian born people was very, very small and limited, so it was difficult at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  But, growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topolcany</span> , what was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Tell me about your family, and... 05:15
ANSWER:  Well, unfortunately I was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">At that time I didn't feel the impact as much, I got special attention, which every boy child would like to have, but as I got a little older I really missed the, some, you know, sisters or brothers, and I depended very much on friendship, and I had lots of friends and we spend many days, I mean, we spend a lot of time together with the friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">You could walk by yourself as soon as you got a little older because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was small and very safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We never heard of any disasters or any crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The only thing that was outrageous in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we had one drunken man and when he use to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">tavern</span> , he use to pass our... where we lived and he use to knock on the <span class="DLF">window</span> , which was quite frightening and sometimes, but that was about all we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We lived in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was called the <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">There were mostly <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , really the center of all activities was there, but there were a few <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , a little separated with a long <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> opened up from this <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , there lived a few professional people and we lived there out of convenience, because my father could have his <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> , we could have upstairs, and then he could have downstairs his <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , everything was in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> and his patients were well trained. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">If they came and no one was there because he had no 05:17 receptionist or nurse, or anyone, he did everything by himself, they just rang the bell and someone would appear upstairs and it was usually yelling down and up, "who is coming down?" </span><span class="sentence" id="19">or "who is coming up?" </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And some of the patients that were more familiar and it was after <span class="BUILDING">office</span> hours would just come up and, many times our appetites would be taken away, it would be middle of the, some meal, and they would come with some of their specimens. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, when I was complaining as a child because I would stop eating as soon as all this is happening in my living, but I was not impressed by that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was a pleasant life, I don't think culturally it was very exciting, we had no <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , we had couple <span class="BUILDING">movie houses</span> and the movies didn't change that often but as kids we had always Sunday afternoon cartoons or stuff like that and we had ice skating rinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It wasn't fancy skates like that, you know, with the shoes and all, it was the same skate that you had a key and as you grew you just enlarged the skates. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And there was a little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> where you put them on or off and they served their hot chocolate or something and it was just fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The same thing changed in summer to the <span class="DLF">tennis court</span> , and so we played tennis, I don't say I was ever great in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then there was a lumberman, who was very nice, and so he gave some lumber and at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> he made like a little beach area, there were a few very primitive, wooden sort of thing that you could change your clothes and there was a place where the local <span class="BUILDING">pastry shop</span> owner in summer brought out there some yogurt and food and you could buy something and he would bring some corn, or you brought your own food. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was quite a distance, you walk through <span class="DLF">fields</span> , but we were use to walking and we didn't mind that, and so there's summers and winters were spent that way except of course for going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And unfortunately, close to 1938 all this pleasantry disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It happened quite, it didn't happen suddenly, but 1t came suddenly into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My mother loved music and she played very well the piano herself, and she spent her afternoons listening to music that was coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , certain times in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Once she listened to the music, expected to hear music, there came an angry voice through the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">A man yelling and especially against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Of course, we then became to know that this was Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And this was our first time that we heard his voice and what is behind that voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And then, as he entered <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , there were some refugees coming to us and they told us about how they had to disrupt their lives and run and come to us, they were guests many times at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But, even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was only few hours from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was distant, because it didn't happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And then, they came into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then we started to feel that it's getting closer and closer, and in fact my father went to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , that was in 1938, to get some visa because he had distant relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> who supplied affidavits for us to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And he was told that there's just no way he could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I recall very well he came back with a globe. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He said "Now we can point our finger to where <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is." </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And, we still weren't terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We made this attempt, but then that's all we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But then one day, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , I was at that time in the fifth grade of the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> ...
QUESTION:  This was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Yeah, that was a public. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">it was actually <span class="BUILDING">city school</span> , city owned <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and as I came to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and was sitting there, all of a sudden our, we call them professors at that level, who use to teach us the Slovak language and he was a very good professor, came dressed in black Fascist uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He spread his legs Fascist-way apart and conducted a lecture, but not about the Slovak language, but a hateful language against the 05:23 Jewish students in this class. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We, you know, no one said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I think today we would have more courage to say anything, but it was so shocking to come and hear that everyone just was stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And up to that time, all in the class were friends, it didn't matter if they were Jews or non-Jews and somehow that disrupted everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We were sort of divided, and soon after that we were not allowed to continue our schooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  What did he say in his lecture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  About the fathers, I can't recall in detail, but how he hated the Jews, the fathers, I know they do this and that, I suppose what is always said of the Jews, that they take away from the others and you know, become rich that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Which I knew in our case for sure was not so, my father was a practicing physician and he treated poor and rich and anyone the same way and the same length of time, he disregarded completely the amount of pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I knew myself because he took me along many times on his house calls and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that sometimes he would get a few carrots and sometimes some corn or fresh milk, that was his payment. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And he even thanked because he knew that's all they could afford and so I knew that he was very, you know, wasn't right what he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I wasn't that familiar with the other fathers, but I knew them well enough, I knew they were working people, and minding their own business. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But it sort of spoiled the friendship from then on, we stopped little by little visiting each other, we didn't do projects anymore then when we stopped going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> became sort of separated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  What sort of a Jewish Community was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , was it a large community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Yes, it was Orthodox community, not all of 1t, we had people who were not that religious, but the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> owners, the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were mostly on the square and on Sabbath they were all closed, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It was interesting, some days, because the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The Catholics, because it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic town</span> , went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and on Sabbath, the Jews went to their <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And my father didn't get religious Jew, and not frequenting the <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> but the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> , the patients who were Catholic, took great comfort in that because in the case of emergency they knew exactly where to find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">If he wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he was in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> and they felt he was right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">You know, that he cared about the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And the community was a caring community, they supported a very good <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , I went to that <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Public School</span> , and an old-age home, and there were very few poor Jews really, and if they were the community supported them. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And...
QUESTION:  But, in general, did the Jewish Community and the non-Jewish community mix, was there any sense of Anti-Semitism before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  I can only tell you what I remember from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I use to go with my father to Gentile patients and next door to us was where the local Priest lived, he lived with his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was, you know, he was in charge of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Mr. Richter was his name, Rev. Richter. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I have even a picture of him because he taught us in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and he taught us Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And he, when there was a nun, when he taught the Catholic religion, we were permitted to leave, you know, the classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But, you know, we could choose to stay, but my father was his doctor and his mother's doctor, he chose him to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I know later on that my father was not permitted to practice anymore as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He personally, and I have his letter, wrote to the Papal Nuncio to allow this Jewish doctor to practice because as he wrote, he brought so many Catholic children into the world and cared so much about the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And my father used to give lectures because they were very primitive, some of the population, and they believed in all kind of nonsense, like a cat runs across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you know, this and that, and they practice this kind of medicine sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And he used to go to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and show how they should 05:29 wash their hands, how important that is, and taught them some simple health, you know, gave them health education. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And he was written up in the Catholic newspaper, I still have some of the newspapers, even though they are almost in shreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But, he made a name for himself as a very caring doctor who didn't choose, if it's someone Jewish or non-Jewish and many people were that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I didn't see such a terrible distinction between Jews and non- Jews, until the laws came against the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  So, the beginning of the war for you was when . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">was it about the time this teacher came into your <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yes, I would say it was in about 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">At first the rules were very mild, we gave up our radio, we had to give up our skates, even though they were simple sakes, tennis rackets. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They were mostly things of luxury or, you know, like recreational things. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You had to even give up your fur collar, from your coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And they gave you, for each of these items, a receipt. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But the biggest blow was to our family when some people, not even from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , some detectives from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , which was a central, the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and where all the law started, from the Slovak government and they sent those people out and they stole all my father's medical equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And, from then on, it was for him against the law to practice medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And, we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as I said and I had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my father used that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when people came, they still wanted to come, even it was illegal, but they sneaked in and my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> became his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He didn't have more than his bag, black bag with some of his equipment, but he was a very good diagnostician and he had most of what he needed in his head, in his ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And he couldn't write prescriptions because it was illegal, but the pharmacist even though he wasn't Jewish was a good friend, and my father send me to, many times without the prescription, I had to memorize the instructions and I brought 05:32 back the medicine that the patients needed, so I became helpful to him and I always wanted to study medicine so this was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">One day, I became really very resourceful, but my father didn't appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">A lady came who needed insulin shots and she had to go away and she didn't want to wait for him, so I says "No, you can do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So, just remembered what he did, I knew there shouldn't be any air in the needle because that could be fatal and I blew out the <span class="DLF">air</span> , filled up and gave her the shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My father was so terrified that he ran to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> to see if the woman is still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But, he discouraged me very much for doing that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But, I enjoyed being, so to speak, his assistant in this except one day, we still had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">You know, most <span class="BUILDING">households</span> did because there are no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacuum cleaners</span> , there are no central heating or automatic warm water, so I had to bring up wood and coal and it was heavy chores, which wasn't really for a woman to do. [</span><span class="sentence" id="102">brief interruption] But, we had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was since I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">It was really cook we could call her, her name was Marca, that was her first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">She came from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and even though she couldn't read or write, she was highly intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She could memorize phone numbers and instructions and speak several languages really. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I adored her. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">She was like a second 05:35: mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Even she had aching feet and when I was a kid she would put me in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> and run in the snow, you know, she would do anything for me and one day, after these restrictions that my father couldn't practice anymore came, a woman knocked middle of the night on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and it was a daughter who's mother was in dire need of medical attention, she had some kind of a heart ailment and my father knew her so well that he always helped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And this Marca, our cook, knew that especially at night if my father ventures out to a patient, he could be deported or jailed or what could happen to him and she didn't wake him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">She told the woman she can't wake him up to go because it against the rules and in the morning the woman came to our <span class="DLF">door</span> and pointed to this poor cook, our Marca, "you killed my mother." </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And she came to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> where we live to get the death certificate but before she did that, she did a very big disservice to come first to us and our poor Marca was a very devoted Catholic and she took it so much to her conscious that she became mentally ill from that point on. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She wouldn't eat, she couldn't function, she totally deteriorated and she died eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And that was an immense loss because she was in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for almost seventeen years. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we went to her funeral and my father bought a stone for her in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , the inscription said, "For devoted service..." and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So that was my first loss because of these rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Then came the rules much faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">First, we had to make a star for ourselves out of sort of yellow felt with the blue Jewish star, and it said "Jew" on it, and we had to sew that on our clothes and we couldn't go out without that. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I remember that first holiday was Rosh Hashana, then, everybody appeared with this star in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And, kids they laughed, we saw it first, you know, it was funny, but it wasn't really very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Then there was a curfew, we couldn't go out after 9:00, we couldn't attend movies, we couldn't do anything at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The way we occupied ourselves because we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , each of us who was good in any subject would prepare herself, or himself, and meet in private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and sort of lecture the rest of the kids in geography or history or whatever, we did that ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And then we had meetings, we had the Maccabi Hatsaie which was a youth movement, and there was a leader who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , a young man, to sort of instruct us in Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And certain books we had to read and meet and Friday night we would sing songs and psalms so, we would still have a little fun someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But then came 1942...
QUESTION:  Your skipping a few years, aren't you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  No, 1939 is when it all became very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">When <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> became autonomous. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And that's when all the rules really started, the local inhabitants became the Helinka (hlinka?) </span><span class="sentence" id="128">guards, the Fascists, and some local people wore black uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> , you couldn't enter without showing your identifications, if I wanted to go in and out of my own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so to speak, I had to show identification.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Did you take any abuse on the <span class="DLF">street</span> from other kids, or where you afraid at all being on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I knew everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I mean, we grew up together, in fact, sometimes on purpose I wouldn't put on this sign "Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I just wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I know someone stopped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I know at one time they did, a man did: "Why don't I have it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="137">and I scolded him. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I said, "How dare you! </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You came so many times at night to ask help from my father and now you dare to confront me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="140">and he kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I was not afraid at all, of anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">That was one of my I think my good points because that helps. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Because I think the more they saw you were afraid the more they abused you. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I think that when they saw someone who really wasn't afraid they stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  So there were abuses of some of the...
ANSWER:  There were small items, but nothing horrifying, except once again, there came detectives. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">That was already around 1940 from again Bratislava, they burst into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I was alone at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and then my father came. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And they took things from our <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> , like chicken fat and butter and stuff like that, they just ransacked the <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They wanted to know where my father's saving books are, and if he doesn't work, how do we live. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I remember those questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And then they took him to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and they took fifty people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> because they wanted a certain amount of money, and until they didn't get that money, they kept these people in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And that was pretty terrifying because we didn't know where they going to take him from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  How long was he gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  About three days in the <span class="BUILDING">local jail</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Did somebody come up with the money to get them out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Yeah, the community had to come up with the money to get those fifty people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But you know, that never ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">When they take, once money they want more money. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And then of course all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , the Jewish owners were kicked out, the Gentiles took over, they called it Arisovak ["arienization"|. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You know, I don't know how to translate it actually, you know, the gentiles took over the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Then they started to come, we couldn't have any help anymore, you know, and like we had to give up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and the rules were getting tougher and then you couldn't travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">If you wanted to travel out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you had to have identification, couldn't travel without that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Could you get these identification papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Well actually, where would you travel? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">One <span class="NPIP">place</span> was like the other so it wasn't important to travel for anyone, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  How did, your father, how did these people support themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  My father still had patients coming and of course we still had some savings, you know, and we were still allowed to use those savings, until a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And of course we lived a very simple life by then, our needs were very small, you couldn't do very much so it was actually just the food you needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There was not much more you could use for money, you know, for. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And, but it really got very bad in 1942, that's when it started getting very bad and where we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> , the notary, which he was the head of the city government, lived in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> as we did, on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , and he had a heart ailment and was very grateful for my father's closeness, he could help him a lot, and I taught his children English and small children, young children, and he came to my father one day, and he said, "You know, doctor, you would do right if you would send your daughter away. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Let her ask at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for a travel permit for two weeks absence because we have here a rule that girls between the ages of 15 and 17 will be taken away to some "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> ," I mean to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">To my father, didn't sound right, he didn't trust the word "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He just, it was an unknown and he listened to this advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I went and I got right away permit because I knew all the people there, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">In better times, long time ago, in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> use to be the gypsies, you know, they stole chickens and carrots and stuff and I had so much pull that I could get the key from the police and let them out after they cried all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They called after me to let them out so I knew all these people there in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and I got the permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And my father got in touch with a second cousin in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was bordering this <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , or very close to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And he had a 05:46 daughter approximately my age and was anxious to do something for her safety too. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So, he knew about a guide, a man, who for some amount of money would transport people from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He had certain connections to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And so, one day, because the girls were suppose to be taken end of March, this was in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And my father accompanied me about middle of March, about a week, we were a week ahead of this rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I said good-bye to my mother, of course, I couldn't carry more than like a rucksack, on my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And he accompanied me to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I met this second cousin and the guide and he instructed us that the same evening we would board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we wouldn't speak, we wouldn't sit together, if one would be caught maybe the other could, sort of escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And we shouldn't speak because our Hungarian wasn't great and if someone was looking for escapees like us, they could, they would readily know that because there were already some girls caught in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">In fact, my best friend was caught with her cousin and another girl and rode back into the <span class="BUILDING">city jail</span> and transported from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that we found out in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So, of course, we listened to the guide and I have to just mention to you that you would think that I was very unhappy to leave me mother, [interruption] I wasn't that unhappy to leave, because life was pretty sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Especially the teenager, of energy and your sort of cooped up, there is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, nothing to do, I was getting pretty unhappy, you know, living that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So this gave me like the opportunity to leave all this, and especially knowing that I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , that was the aim, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> which I use to visit my grandparents and aunts and cousins my age lived there and it was a capital and had lots of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So, I thought, great, I'm leaving this horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And, I didn't know that it might be final, you know, I thought it just a temporary arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So I was pretty cheerful to say good-bye and go, and even to say good-bye to my father and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And so, we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that night, I think 1t was around March 17th or so, in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where we did that was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarik</span> and we rode on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you know, he purchased our tickets and he was in charge so we didn't have to speak, this guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  He was just a Slovakian... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  He was probably both Slovakian and Hungarian, he got well paid for his efforts and he was supposed to bring us all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> safely, and then report back to the girl's parents and to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Of course, what he did is, the <span class="DLF">road</span> out, not more than forty minutes out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarik</span> (?), (</span><span class="sentence" id="197">Sered?) </span><span class="sentence" id="198">and he said, he said he would show with his hand when it's time to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you know, not use too much words there, you know, and he showed us to get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So, we all got off, I mean, the girl, my cousin Lily and me and the guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And then he, there was a <span class="DLF">hay stack</span> right close by and he says, "You get in there now." </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And we heard some dogs barking and there was on the horizon you could see up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> a big <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and that was already <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And he said, "You know those guards they'll now change for a second, this one guard, and in that second you've got to run into this <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and there's no one there, no guard at that point." </span><span class="sentence" id="203">End of Tape #1 Tape #2 So, we giggled in this hay stack, we thought it was a great adventure to do all this, you know, what a fun, you know, and how silly they were, you 05:55 know, and then he told us to now run for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And we ran into the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and it was a nice farmer and the guy left us, good-bye, finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And took most of our things too, that were suppose to be given to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Some change of clothing and whatever, some shoes, there wasn't that much there and he took his payment and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I mean, the payment was prepaid. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And the farmer pointed to a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , by then we were real tired and we went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And at daybreak, it was really just daybreak, he told us to look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we feel there were some farmers going with their produce to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was really <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And he gave us a basket with some vegetables in it and he told us just follow the crowd, go with them, so we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We did what we were told to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And we walked and we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galanta</span> , that's where we were heading, and I knew that in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> lived my Aunt, my father's sister, I'd been visiting there before and she had six children, and so, but no one told us the address, they'd forgot, so who are you going to ask? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We were afraid to stop anyone, they could be our enemies, any one because even so <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was free of the Germans and German rules yet, but they had rules against aliens, I mean, people come illegally into their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , it was not a rich <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they couldn't afford to support all these people, there were already refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they didn't need more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So, we were afraid to ask, but then there was light 05:57 in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> because it was just before Passover time, and we saw a bearded Jew, you know, that time a beard meant religious Jew yet, you know, those were the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so we dared, we thought he couldn't be a gangster and, of course, 1t was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , everybody knew each other, and he took us straight to where my family lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Now, you would think they were swell to see you, wasn't so at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">My Aunt was terrified, she said, "Must be terrible if your father let you go," and "you can't stay here, not even for any time," because her sons were being looked for, they were suppose to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and they were hiding so they didn't need more people hiding there from things, so she dispatched one of her sons that was safer for him to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , that he should be the one to accompany us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> was loaded with gendarmes and policemen and we were afraid to look, no one should look very much at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And we found out, at least I did, that running away and being a refugee and even being free from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> didn't mean that much fun, it's pretty scary and sad because really people don't like you that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And so, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and arrived safely and headed for my grandparents <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Now, you know, my other cousins all lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> when they were boys, so I was the only granddaughter living out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there was a really big celebration every time I would come and visit, which was maybe once or twice a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But when I came to their <span class="DLF">door</span> , there was no happiness seeing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Was similar reaction as my Aunt's, things must be very bad and I don't know if you could stay here really, we could be punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So, they had a long, they were discussing it among themselves what to do, and they figured out that the best would be if I go and stay with my Aunt and her family, which I preferred, because she had two sons, my cousins, they were similar to my age and I was looking for fun, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So I went there, and, but when my father returned from the company to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> , he came back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , he saw already on the <span class="DLF">Synagogue wall</span> a big poster telling that all the Jews have to gather within a week at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , they'll be all taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And my father didn't wait for that to happen like he didn't wait for me to be caught, and got in touch again with the same guy, even so he didn't do the service he was suppose to do, and asked him to take my father, my mother and him, the same route as he had took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So I was very surprised one morning, then I saw my parents few days later after I arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And they stayed for a few days with my grandparents, but not very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Now, our situation wasn't as bad as most of the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Number one, my parents spoke perfect Hungarian, my mother was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , my father got his medical degree in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And he was allowed, actually, to practice medicine there. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He got a job on the staff of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish General Hospital</span> legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Illegally, he took again his little black bag and went and visited the refugees who didn't dare to go officially to a doctor, but were very happy to, you know, when my father went to them for a very limited fee. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And the other thing was that they took on a furnished room at a person, they didn't tell her what really their status was, their immigration or legal status was, they just said he's a doctor and he's taking some courses, you know, some excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And so, we lived in this <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> , now the cooking was pretty difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">My mother could cook on a one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">burner</span> , you know, a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">portable stove</span> and meantimes, I was dispatched to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish restaurant</span> for food, and, I don't know if your familiar with those carriers there, metal, aluminum carriers divided into parts where the soup would be in one <span class="NPIP">part</span> , and the other foods . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">the only problem was, you couldn't go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> with it because they were afraid you'd spill it on some of the passengers, so I had to carry it quite a distance <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , it was quite difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And, so they existed that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">My father always was a big stickler for education because that's how he became from a very poor person a successful doctors so education was everything to him and he felt I shouldn't be denied that. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So he got in contact with a <span class="BUILDING">girls' Gymnasium</span> 06:03 too and they permitted me, not to attend classes, first of all I didn't speak the Hungarian, they were afraid, you know, for me to go, but they gave me some lessons to learn and I could go and pass exams, and so I continued my education past the sixth grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  This <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , was this mixed Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  It was, it had nothing to do with Jewish, it was a regular <span class="BUILDING">girls' gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was...
QUESTION:  Just a public...
ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah it was both. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was actually a private girls' gymnasium. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The name was Vaszkurlia (ph) was the name of it, woman, man, or whatever, writer or poet or something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  What I'm just trying to get a sense of, I know that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> 's real problems hadn't begun yet, but were there any problems for Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  No, not for the Hungarian Jews, but they were looking constantly for Jews like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And they were having conducted razzias, which was, they combed whole <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> really looking for people like us and they put them into <span class="NPIP">holding places</span> , and usually those <span class="NPIP">holding places</span> were <span class="BUILDING">Synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The Jewish community had to support the people that they jailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And when there were enough of them they would deport them. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So, it wasn't easy to be a refugee either. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But, as I said, we had it somewhat easier having family there and easier with (re)sources than most people did and I had fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Through my cousin, I became acquainted with a boy, and we became girlfriend, boyfriend, they taught me how to dance, and, you know, when you seventeen, you really don't care who is looking behind your shoulder, you have to run away at night to hide it's still, you know, was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And we lived this way until 1944, Spring of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I have to tell you, that I think from those times on Passover, is not a pleasant holiday for me because all these horrible things always happened just before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And so, one morning, as I slept, I heard goose steps, and it was Germans marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And we knew that, what we, how we lived till now wouldn't be enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We would have to do much more to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Because my father, being a father, his main concern was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And he had a patient who was an <span class="BUILDING">ink factory</span> owner. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">She came from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and married a very rich man there and they lived in a gorgeous <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> that had special, underneath the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> was for the <span class="INT_SPACE">custodian apartment</span> because they were so fancy they had those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> , I know it has a name that evades me right now, that carried the food from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> up to the, you know, dumbwaiters or something, it's called. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So anyways, he became acquainted and their doctor and they told my father the day our familiar visit, <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian office</span> and their family, I think the officer sort of liked them better than his own family and he told them that he knows his wife was looking into a Catholic charity to look for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work for her, you know, like a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And, maybe I should go there to him and tell them that that's where I was told that they are looking for employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And my father got me a maid's book. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">You know, in Europe, you couldn't just go and serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You had to have your picture, it was like a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And you had to have recommendations from your past employers, if you were good, if you were honest, if you were a hard worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So, I came all dressed up because you know those girls were usually peasant girls who did this kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They were dressed accordingly, they wore thick hose and wore babushka, you know, kerchiefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And so I got all fixed up, my name changed, I became 'Anna Voyachickola', that was my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And because it was in a sort of Slovak-Hungarian area, even so was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , my not-so-good Hungarian wouldn't be detected that much, it would make sense that I don't speak 100% Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So, I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , was quite far, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is divided, it's 'Buda' and '<span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pest</span> ' and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Danube</span> divides it, and there are many <span class="DLF">bridges</span> to get to this was in 'Buda'. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And so, I traveled to 'Buda' and I was fully accepted as 'Anna Voyachickola' and they handed me a lot of hard work that I was really not accustomed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I had to take rugs, heavy rugs, down into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , I don't know if your familiar, they sort of made out of bamboo or something and you have to bang the rugs, you put it on one of those hanging . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">they were specially made, and you had to bang those rugs, the dust out, I don't think it worked very well because it just went back and forth, the dust, it didn't suck it out 1t just moved it from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, but it was hard job and then when you were done you had to again roll it back up and lug it up and, you know, those rugs were at least 12' x 10' or bigger and heavy, so it was no fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You know, I didn't complain, I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And they gave me loads of shirts to iron, I never ironed a shirt in my life, the most I ironed was some handkerchief or maybe some dollies or what, but not long- sleeved shirt that had been starched, and I really didn't know how do you attack these things, how do you go about, but you know, if you have to . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">just do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I have learned to iron so well I think I could get employment in one of the <span class="NPIP">shirt places</span> , and, but, my downfall came there when they played some music one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And as I was dusting, I hummed the music, it was some kind of a Strauss melody and I think I sang it ahead of it's time, and I became very suspect, how does 'Anna Voyachickola' know this kind of music, this is not right! </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But lucky for me, they didn't feel at all that I was a Jewish refugee, they told those people and we found out from the husband because he confided in those friends of my father, they thought I was planted there by Germans, they wanted to know how a Hungarian officer act during their regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But frankly I didn't go back there anymore, first of all, there was a <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> close by and the allies started bombarding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> very heavily, especially that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So, many times, I couldn't come back by any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span> I had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And it was tremendous distance after putting in four (full?) </span><span class="sentence" id="285">hours of hard work, so I didn't go back there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I, at that time there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> formed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Few <span class="DLF">Jewish streets</span> , where Jews used to live in some of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> were designated as <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> and many families had to move in together and share.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  This was in '44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Spring of '44?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  Yeah, early '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And so, I told my father you know it's very well that you took care of my needs but I am worried about you and mother and I think you should do something too. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So he got himself a false identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He became, his name was Isberg, but now he was Dr. Alakesh and there he was there again for some studies for a few months and they moved into the <span class="INT_SPACE">custodian apartment</span> of these ink manufacturers. [</span><span class="sentence" id="295">short interruption] Let me back track to 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Okay, I missed out on something there. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">My father tried to find me a furnished <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> because he didn't want me to live with my parents, he felt if one is caught the other could save himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And he went with me to the, you know, the advertised rental to this lady, Mrs. Braushaendler (ph), I remember her name in a very nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> not far from where my parents lived, and there were two other girls living. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">She had a daughter who was a very good seamstress, she was a widow, the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And she gave me, it wasn't really a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , it was part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , she just separated a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with a sort of curtain and that was where I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And one day, this was in 1943, one day on a Sabbath morning, they were looking, it was a razzia, they were looking for refugees and even so, they didn't look particularly for me, they were looking for others, but they found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And, they knew right away from conversation with me that I'm a refugee and they gave me just enough time to get dressed, and while I was getting dressed I had enough time to tell the daughter of the lady to please run, I didn't tell her it's my father, they thought it was my Uncle, go and tell my Uncle that I'm being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They didn't know that I was a refugee, those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So, she notified, she then notified my father and I was taken to, it was a <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And they had some more people like me, there were quite a few people like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And they kept these people until they had enough and would take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  The people you were renting from, did they know you where Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  Oh sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Oh, you mean the people I was renting from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  That's what I said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  Yeah, they knew I was Jewish but didn't know I'm not Hungarian, they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I guess by then maybe my Hungarian improved, I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But I was being taken into this <span class="NPIP">holding place</span> , and this boyfriend that I had when he found out, he got so upset that he went ... they had a very fancy <span class="BUILDING">store</span> downtown in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , he emptied I think the safe from all the money they had, he was going to buy me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But of course, it didn't work that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But anyways, he came to visit, my father couldn't because he wasn't legal, but this boyfriend could. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And my father was afraid that I'll be taken away from there, so he found out from a chemist that there is some kind of powder that in large amounts it make bombs, but in very, very small amounts it colors you, like, you would have like symptoms of hepatitis, you'd become all yellow and feverish, and you know <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that were terrified of having an outbreak, and he knew that if I get that, I would be taken straight to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish General Hospital</span> where he was on the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And he prepared the people there that I would be probably coming as a patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he was so right, I took this powder and within hours I turned, like an egg yolk. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And the doctor right away dispatched me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I was truly sick because it was poison and affected all my glands. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And, the detectives came there too because there were a few refugees like me already hiding under pretenses, you know, and they got the whiff of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So, my father taught me how to manipulate the thermometer, it shouldn't go too high, it shouldn't go too low. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">You know, under the sheet I would rub it because of the quicksilver, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It was an old-fashioned kind of thermometer. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And so, I was there three weeks, and meanwhile, I had an Uncle living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , my father's brother, who had many friends and he got to get one of his friends to adopt me, so I should be legalized, because I was still under age. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And, even so, I never met the man, but as a result, I was able to leave the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> semi-legalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I still wasn't allowed to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> under the circumstances but at least I could leave the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then I lived alone in another <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> , not where I lived before. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So this was until 1944 and then in 1944, of course, the Germans came and there were some <span class="NPIP">places</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and then we took assumed names and after I gave up being 'Anna Voyachickola' we all went to hide in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of this custodian of this ink manufacturer. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They escaped themselves, so they didn't live there anymore, it was just us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">custodian's apartment</span> living. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But after we were there about a week, my father couldn't stand the isolation and being away from his patients, so he took his little black bag and went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where his former patients lived now. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And as he was leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he was accosted by detectives. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Still Hungarian, detectives, even though it was occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they, him and two others they found in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Now, he had in one of his coat pockets his real name and in his other one, his false identification and so, of course, they knew that they caught the right person they were looking for and they took all three of them, two detectives took three captured people into the <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> , there was a big, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> going in all directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And in one of the big <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened wide and my father was very resourceful, he tells one of the detectives, "Look! </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Your guy ran out on you, just now!" </span><span class="sentence" id="338">and when the other detective looked two of them ran away, so the two detectives remained with one guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And my father ran all the way where we lived at that time and he told us what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We had some supper ready and everything and I said . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">somehow I took over from that point on. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I think, when your young you are easier in command of what happen next. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And I told my father to shave his mustache and you have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So we went on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we just grabbed a few of our things and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And we didn't know what to tell him, where do we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and we didn't want to endanger anyone with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So we told him at one point to leave us off, and my father remembered there was someone who was still legal in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and protected, sort of, under protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Who was at one time his teacher and my father was his doctor and he told him in case of need, you can turn to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So we knocked on his <span class="DLF">door</span> , because you never knew, will they let you in or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">But he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And he allowed us to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And my father went out to look for something for us to do to, you know, what would be the next step? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There weren't many options. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And, as he went, he heard a story that today, I think your hair would stand up from disbelief, but he swalowed it and the story was that there are some German Army Officers, or Army personnel, who are disillusioned with the army life and they have their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German army truck</span> and they would take us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Now, part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was liberated by partisans, very small part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And that was where we were going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Of course, it cost a lot of money and my father didn't have it, so he tried to organize some more into coming with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">He got 44 people in all, among them was my cousin, the one that I slept in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when I first escaped and her family by then was already taken away because from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> they took families earlier and she knew she was the only one left. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And some friends, and there were even two women who were pregnant and had young children, there was all kind of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And we were suppose to meet the Germans with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> at this little <span class="DLF">park</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And the Rabbi where we stayed blessed us and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And as we were approaching the <span class="DLF">park</span> there were big flood lights turning on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And we knew right away when there's a secret mission you don't turn on flood lights but we couldn't run away anymore, we were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And it was no mission of rescue, it was a mission that they were plotting and they hit us, kicked us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And sped to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , that's where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was underground of a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , of a real <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for criminals, it had several <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And the men and women were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">The men were taken, I think to a <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and the women and children to the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> with locked <span class="DLF">doors</span> like criminals and they gave us this little bathing, this little water, barely for eleven people to wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And for the children they would bring a little better food. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I remember I was so beaten that my nose was bleeding quite badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And we were all in a state of shock but one of the woman who had a young child was able to tell a story to the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And somehow that narration and that calmness of that woman put me to sleep and got me relaxed. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And so, we were in this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and, I just want to mention for a minute, the next morning when they 06:28: opened for a minute the <span class="DLF">jail door</span> , across from our <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was another <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> where a young woman was doing exercising, she was in solitary confinement doing head stands and gesticulating to me like this and that, you know, and I had no clue. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">What's with her and what is her privilege being all alone in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Well, they allowed us about every second day, each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was allowed to go down to the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> under the guards' supervision to walk around in circles and this young woman, being on our <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> joined me in this walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And she told me, you probably heard of her, her name was Hanna Senesh, she was a parachutist trained by the English to come and rescue some people and she was caught by the Croats in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> on the <span class="DLF">border</span> and brought here with the other parachutists friends, and she wouldn't tell on the others and of course she was being interrogated and she knew for sure she will be hung after a while, but it was a privilege for me, even for a short while, to meet her because she was a very courageous woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But anyway, we stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for about three to four weeks and after that we were again ordered to go down these <span class="DLF">stairs</span> with whatever belongings we had and come to the main <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and for the first time I felt like the men came there too, the few who were Jailed, including my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He was handcuffed with one hand to another man with his hand so the two men were always together no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And his hand was quite swollen from the handcuffs. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And there were a lot of trustees in this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , there were manufacturers, Jews, who were the first ones to be put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and they acted like trustees so I asked one, "Where are we being taken to?" </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And by then, even we weren't sure what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was but we knew it's a place you don't come back from. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And so it wasn't a very pleasant idea to be there, but I found a postcard in my purse that they returned to me, they took it when we got to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and I found a pen and I wrote to my boyfriend, even so I didn't put his address just his name so I didn't know how he might get it, but I wrote that we are being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and then we were marched, we were twenty-seven people not all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Among us were non-Jews, the women and children remained behind that were not being taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We were marched to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and we were called 'political prisoners' because we wanted to escape the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And put on regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with guards in each <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , and there were guards on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And, they found the card, the Germans found my card and they were running around with it, holding it high up in all <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> , walking around, that, of course my mother knew who it was because she knew the name it was directed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But of course the person never got it, I just, the reason I wrote it I just didn't want to disappear without anyone knowing that, where we are being taken.

<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Was there a strong Nazi presence on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , was either a lot of soldiers around, or...
ANSWER:  You know, I wasn't that much around because they came middle of March, I became the maid, and in May we were already taken to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , so there wasn't that much time in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It was, and we didn't stay were we use to live, we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were we were unknown and we didn't dare 06:35: to go out very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">That was not a normal life, we didn't communicate with anyone, not even with your family anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I didn't even know what's going on very much, as you see my father was caught in the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , so...
QUESTION:  And the life in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  There was no life. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We were in that one-room <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and there were bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">The allies, and the gentile population of the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was taken in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , but the Jews were left to burn to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You know, those were those carpet bombings, I don't know if your familiar with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It's like, going like this . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">you could see the flames, and it was close to us, any minute we thought we going to go into flames, so this old lady taught us how to say the last prayer before you die and we sat on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and said that prayer, that's all we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So you can't call it life, it was, you know, we talked and we, the poor two little children were there, you know, with their mothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  Were you scared?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Scared? </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We were more always scared of what's next somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">The fear was always, you know I have to tell you when I was found out, when they took me away that Saturday morning and put me into that <span class="BUILDING">holding place</span> , it was almost a relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And then, I don't have to anymore run from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">You know, because you were always afraid you'll be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">You know, so after a while you just don't care, you want to be relieved of this fear, you know, we were constantly afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Fear of the unknown, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Because we just knew it was horrible, but no one knew for sure exactly what it is.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Yeah, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It was not the kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that most people that you have in your <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">This <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a normal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because we were political prisoners, this was our advantage so to speak, you know, being labeled as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">You know, you never know what was your advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And we were just twenty some people, it wasn't hordes of people, 1t was just us. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And there were no children among us. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But the old lady was. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And, there were even bombings on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and they got us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> into a <span class="NPIP">holding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And, you know, people looked at you, the other passengers, and you wondered: how do they look at you? </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Do they pity you, do they, are they happy to see you like this, do they hate you, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">You didn't know what the expression you saw on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> against Jews, all kind of symbols and words against, so, and, the guards, they even fed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They gave us bread and things and the guards told us we should give them our watches, our rings, because were we go, we won't need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I was very defiant as a young person and I just took my mothers and my things, I wished I could take everybody's, and went in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and flushed it down with great satisfaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I felt was a much better <span class="NPIP">place</span> than in the guards hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And we traveled like that, not, you know, it wasn't that long, next morning I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw people working, mostly in striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was a nice June morning and I saw 06:40: them working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And I was always instructed or taught that if you work you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Well, under normal circumstances probably but not under the German regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So I was very hopeful when I saw people working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , I thought that's what we would be doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  How much information did you have about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  I was under the impression that we would be killed on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I heard of gassings in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and I thought that's what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And, when it didn't happen, I thought well, you know, we made it that far.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  Did they tell you you were going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , or... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  No, they didn't say, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I just got from the trustee the information that we are being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  And you didn't know much about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  I didn't know details. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Knew that it's a <span class="NPIP">place</span> you just don't want to go, no one ever came back, no, there were no details about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  And this is late?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Yeah, it's late.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  It's 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Yeah, still didn't know, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Okay.. All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So you arrived and you see... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  So, we arrived at the normal <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And my father, we were handcuffed and all, and interesting, my father's, what his reaction was when we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> he begged me for forgiveness. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">That he got me here, and he explained why. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">When I was about 15 I had a chance to go on a Youth Aliya to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , which I wanted to do, and he wouldn't permit me because the morals weren't good there, you know, bad reputation, and he just wouldn't let me go, and he asked for forgiveness, if he would have let me go, I wouldn't have gotten here. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And he promised then and then, that if we get out of there, he'll never interfere in my decisions, and he never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So, we said good-bye to the men, just saw them from a distance being led away, and couple guards led us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And we were approaching <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Birkenau</span> , they preferred it be called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and it had the famous inscription, which still I believed, until I got in, "Arbeit Macht Frei" which means "Work Makes You Free." </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And this is the biggest lie, there were high voltage wires, and let me give you the impression when I saw and entered this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">As I walked within the <span class="DLF">door</span> , walked after us, my first impression was, and I looked around because this was not a normal <span class="NPIP">place</span> you could tell, that I died, this is true, and I woke up in <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> , I must have been a very bad person to wake up bad(ly) punished, to come to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Because the people that I saw there were not human looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Young men with shaven heads, with glazed eyes, with funny clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They just moved in a crazy way and then the Germans shouting, they had two words, they were key words, "Raus" and "Schnell," "out" and "fast." </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And lucky were us that we understood German, if you didn't then you were readily kicked or pushed and, you know, the scene was that there were turrets with guards and the guns were pointing towards the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There were <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> , unusual <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> with unusual smoke coming out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And I caught hold of a young girl who looked a little normal and I tried to inquire, you know, you have learned very fast not to ask for much and talk too much, this was not good, but I dared to ask, I said: "You know, in 1942 many of my friends I think they were brought here." </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And I mentioned my best friend's name, maybe you know her name was Helga Fayhee (ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So she points toward this <span class="DLF">chimney</span> with the huge smoke, you could smell the flesh from that smoke, and said "That's were they all are, including your friend." </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I didn't know what she was talking about, then. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And then everything "Schnell! </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Schnell!," </span><span class="sentence" id="486">so of course, everything was taken from us even little what we had, and "Schnell! </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Schnell!," </span><span class="sentence" id="488">we were chased into what they called "the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It isn't a <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> that you picture, it was a huge place with showers, and they were real showers. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We had to totally undress which was very unusual, in Europe in those days people just didn't undress in front of strangers, there were men there too who shaved us every <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they sprayed disinfectant on us and they, they handed us this soap that had initials. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It said RJF. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And RJF meant Rein Juedisch Fett, translated Clean Jewish Fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">In other words, the soap was made from the victims, everything was utilized there. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And of course, we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So they turned on the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and "Schnell! </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Schnell!" </span><span class="sentence" id="497">we had to soap ourselves, and we hardly rinsed ourselves, they didn't give you enough time, and "Schnell! </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Schnell!" </span><span class="sentence" id="499">you have to get your clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Now, you didn't get your clothes, you got what was thrown there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">If it fit or didn't fit, made no difference, it's not, it's as soon as it's "Schnel!." </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Now you can imagine how I felt seeing my mother in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and probably she also felt seeing me, but I have to tell you that as soon as we got there, she was not my mother anymore in a practical way. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">She became the child and I was the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">She just couldn't function in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And, so my allotment of clothes was a black dress with short sleeves, and no underclothes at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The shoes were the most dire thing because they usually didn't fit, no one measured you, and if they were very bad, if the fitting was totally out, you were doomed because most of the time you were on your feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">There were no <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you could sit or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And many people died on account just not having the right shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Your feet swell or were so hurt that they couldn't continue, but my shoes were acceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And they were both the same size, both the same heel because it didn't have to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">You could have had the right foot in the wrong, you know, different size than the left foot, or different heel. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So, then "Schnel! </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Schnel!" </span><span class="sentence" id="514">they painted a red stripe on our backs because they without this you could maybe escape, which was ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I don't know how they imagined that. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Then they gave us, over our left chest, describing us, what kind of prisoners we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And then there were <span class="BUILDING">Stations</span> ...
QUESTION:  What did yours say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Jew, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  Was it a special designation for political prisoner, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But then there were <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> , you know, where you went through like, when you go to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> or something you have to go through, and there were girls tattooing people because, you know, you lost your name the minute you arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , now, I had already two names that weren't mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">First my cousin's, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galanta</span> they gave me my cousin's name to really legalize, then I became 'Anna Voyachickola' and I lost my name altogether because everybody was called out by number, and my number was one number higher than my mother's. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">The irony of it is, my mother was such an esthetic person that she checked each girl that did the best job in tattooing and she found that this one who did me did the most beautiful job, and I really never saw a nicer tattoo, if you can call it nice. [</span><span class="sentence" id="525">Shows tattoo] And then I got this triangle which meant ‘political prisoner’. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Now the girls told me "Your lucky," the ones that tattooed me, "you have a living number." </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I said, "What do you mean by that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And she said, "Well, if you don't have an 'A' or a 'B', that means that this number is as many people as there were now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and your the first one with this number." </span><span class="sentence" id="529">The people who had 'A's" meant that one person already died with that number. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The person who had 'B' there were two who had died with that number. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So, and they have to give it to me because I was political prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Now, I didn't know really that I was political prisoner until I visited a year and a half ago 06:51: the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and there are arms with this number and the explanation that, in the beginning, it was non-Jews or old men who had this. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Then there were men who were Jews and there were very few women who had this. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I'm distinguished with this triangle pointing the I am political prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But you didn't want to be called your number, you were afraid to be called that was the biggest fear everyone because when they called your number it meant death most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So, after we were tattooed, then "Schnell! </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Schnell!," </span><span class="sentence" id="538">they ran us through what was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , a wooden structure, and there were hundreds and thousands of them because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was divided into A-B-C-D-E-F. We were in '<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">A' camp</span> , we were the... we just came and I think they waited for the visas for something, they kept you in sort of isolation for a short while and there was <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> maybe for 100 people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we were 400 in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And where we slept were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , three-tier <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">The way you have it in your <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> there are no, we had no straw, we had no sheets, no pillows, no blankets and there was space for maybe three people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> to stretch out, we were eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">If one person wanted to turn sometime during the night all eight had to turn because there just was no way that it could be accomplished, there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And at 2:00 AM they would wake us up with their flashlight, again "Schnell! </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Schnell!," "</span><span class="sentence" id="544">Raus!" </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Raus!" </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And we would have to stand, everyone in front of the <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> and then we would look out into <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , we saw these repeated, in front of each <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , it was like black from the people, women, standing there, and the magic number was five, you stood five in width and five in length. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stand, it depended how you ran out, you know, where you got your <span class="NPIP">place</span> , was in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Number one, you were protected from being seen; number two, if it was cold and windy, the people somehow enclosed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But, one day, as we were standing, you could stand there for hours regardless of the weather, hours and hours until it didn't jive all the numbers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And the people who didn't stand in the <span class="DLF">front line</span> had to have their arms up over their shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">There was a person who was in charge of each <span class="DLF">block</span> , the <span class="DLF">block</span> "Aelteste," the block elder, and she would tell you "Rensid Naramana," you know they spoke Polish, but knowing Slovak so it was sort of, you know, I could figure out what they meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And you know, if you tried just for five minutes to keep your arms at that, in that position, you feel like you don't have arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And if you have to do it five hours then you can imagine what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  What did that mean, what they were saying... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  "Arms on the shoulders." </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And, at that time they distributed your rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Now the ration was bread, piece of bread, that was made mostly out of sawdust and some brown liquid. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Now, I didn't have even my own cup, so I had to use from everyone, what everybody else used, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Lucky for my mother and me, the people found out that we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they knew who we were, some people yet from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and others, and they brought a sweater for my mother and they brought some bread for me when we arrived, which was very pleasant to be welcomed, even there to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And the thing was to adapt, which my father, that was his main teaching in my life as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">To be flexible and to adapt. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I was able to do it, instead of like some, and they were very detested by the old prisoners, we called them "Alter Haeftling,"” means "old prisoner" and there were the new prisoners which, you know, they felt they still had a good life for a while, which was their right, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They came and started complaining to this "old heflinck" if they detested you. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But if you adapted, they helped you. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And I adapted. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">If I knew that I have to wash <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a bucket so I washed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I offered to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">There was a job called "stubendienst", "Stube" means "<span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ," "Dienst" means "service," so it's room service. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">In this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they took great care to paint the tiles red, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">They broke bricks to make the color with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And I offered to help and I had an advantage with that, that they let my mother lie up after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were fixed and she could lie there and rest, so that was my advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And we worked hard, and one time, we had to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , it was called "Aussenkommando" , meaning "working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So after we stood we'd file out there and got our ration, there were an orchestra playing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There was an orchestra at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that led <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with the vicious dogs on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> playing a march for us to march out. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And I remember seeing a rotten apple as I walked and I was dying to have that rotten apple and one of the guards just kicked it away before I could get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And as we walked, I saw a little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , I guess some of the guards lived, seeing some steam coming out and shade, by biggest dream was to live in such a <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , to be away from everyone because you were never alone, you couldn't wash by yourself there are millions of things in the <span class="INT_SPACE">wash room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">You couldn't run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> alone, there were latrines that you sat back to back with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It's nice to be with people but it's nice to be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And you never had that, something that was your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And in the 06:60 Aussenkommando we had to cut bushes down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> which was the main river of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It was pretty chilly by then, it was the end of September and October, it's very cold there, the climate is horrible there. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">There's malaria there, it's a bad climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And one of the guards, he was a Hungarian that was taken in, he took pity on me and gave me his food, and I asked him why, if your doing it he could be killed by that, and he said, "I don't want to be here, really, I didn't wanna be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Where I lived there was some Jewish family who were very good to my family and I want to pay it back." </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And things like that gave you extra strength, that you saw that the world didn't go completely cuckoo, you know, that there are some humans even here who are decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">That sort of gave you courage, and the other thing was that my father kept in touch with me through human messages, telling me where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He worked very hard, he had to carry <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> and got a double- sided hernia because he didn't know how to carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He had to shine trumpets, polish instruments for the musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">He had to put up hard shoe polish, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">But then at the end, some of the people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> who had been old prisoners, because the old prisoners, you know, it was . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">there were 07:02 people at higher ranks and some old prisoners had higher ranks. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">The Germans trusted them and gave them jobs to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And some of them were able to get my father to become a doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> taking care of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So his life had improved a great deal, he didn't have to stand Zell Appell. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">We got better food. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Some of the prisoners who got cigarettes they would give to him and because he didn't smoke, he was able to exchange it for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And he would send me a tomato sometimes, which was a gift unthinkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And, those things kept you going. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then I heard there was woman, her position was "Schreiber" or Writer [secretary?], </span><span class="sentence" id="600">and that was the highest position a Jew could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">She spoke several languages, she was very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And her position was to be in charge of all the accountings, of all the Zell Appells and responsible for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">That the numbers jived and are correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Now that was a very responsible position. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And she found out that under this number who is the name, and one day she came to us, she wants to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">She called the number and I was terrified that the number was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I said, "Why do you want to help?," </span><span class="sentence" id="608">you know, even from Jews you become suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And she told me that her sister, and I knew who she was talking about, her name was "Goldstein," lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and she resembled her a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">She said, they were I remember big Zionist, her sister and brother- in-law and the two children, and my father saved the sister's life and the child in childbirth. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And even they don't live anymore, but she wants to help us through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So, you know, I always say you never know in your life when you help someone who benefits from that help. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It might be someone totally unrelated or, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And so, she wanted . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">her help was to give us job in the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> , that was a big job! </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Because if you worked there, you got double portions but I said "I really appreciate the job, but it's one job I just can't do," you know because, they were just <span class="DLF">holes</span> and you take a stick and clean it with a stick and no matter how hungry I was, that was something I just couldn't bear to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So I thanked her a lot and had to give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But then one day I heard that about forty-two girls that came in '42 with the original <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that I escaped, you know, when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , are being taken out to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was called I think "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz II</span> " but I heard later it was called the Statsgebaeude, which means "a <span class="BUILDING">state building</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It was just an hour or less walk from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , but the circumstances were compared like from <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> to <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> , you know, compared to the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So I again was pretty courageous, you know, they had alarms, block alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Block alarm meant between each A-B-C-D there were <span class="DLF">electric gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And then <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came, they locked these <span class="DLF">gates</span> so that you shouldn't see wants going on, or shouldn't tell those people where they are being taken because if two, three hundred people come and they find out and they started to fight, you couldn't do the killing job properly and, well. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But I went through this alarm before the <span class="DLF">gate</span> closed to her where she was, and I said, "Now, you wanted to help us once, maybe you could help us now. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I heard these girls are being taken there, maybe you could include my mother and me in that group," and she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And that was a big, big help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  Before we go on, can I ask you some questions about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  The block leaders, the block elders, where were they from and how did they treat you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  It all depended, it was totally personal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION:  In your <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , in your <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  Maybe it was, but I think it was the old timers who would do it because, see, they had connection with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Sometimes men came to work into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the meeting place was the latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Newspapers were brought, their exchanges with cigarettes and food and they got their news and they got what their going to do there. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">That's where the, you know, the Germans didn't go in those latrines for obvious reasons, they were not a pleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  Was seeing collective punishment or beatings or these sorts of abuses, was that regular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  Now beatings, they were constantly beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">If you didn't go fast enough they kicked you, they beat you, they send a dog on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">That was normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">For instance, someone died and in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> was a person was alive and the dead person was next to them, you know, and that was a normal thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And, I want to tell you this story, which I didn't finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Once we stood cell block count with my mother, it was in the beginning, and one of the Germans who were counting came and pushed her out in front and the next stop would be to take her number and then take her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">In my desperation, I looked down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> hoping some miracle happens, and as I looked down I saw some red something appearing, and I picked it up even so it was not allowed to move from your <span class="NPIP">position</span> and 1... it was something and I smeared it on my mother's cheeks and pushed her back in and it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">He never paid attention to her anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So I feel that was my personal, you know, victory so to speak, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And there were such personal victories, that's all you could do, you had no arms, there was no communication with others, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Things like that have to be made together, you know, there has to be a leader, and we were constantly weaker, you know, weakened from starvation and you loose the will to do anything, you know you just want to, one more day, one more hour, one more minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But anyways, I started telling you that I went to this woman, to the "Schreiberin" (her) name was Attica and I begged her to help us now, which she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So one day we found ourselves standing with I think there were forty-one and two of us made it forty- three, and they marched out into the Statsgebaeude it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">There were only <span class="BUILDING">Brick buildings</span> there, I understand that these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were made for the Russian prisoners of war and then, when they were moved, they others moved in, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">There were only a thousand women in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">You know, I found some couple girls from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and when they arrived, they waited us with real towels and with real soap, which was great present to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And they made arrangements that I could see my father, they knew the doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> and she could send me to the dentistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">You know, it was a privileged camp so to speak, this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Red Cross camp</span> , this is what they would show, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Our Zell Appell lasted five minutes, it was just the performa thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">We were really not starved there, we got enough bread and things and we could actually, there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of each <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , there were places where you could sit down and eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And when I tell these stories to other survivors I don't think they believe me, but there are some who were there know. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And most of the people who were there worked for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">They were either fantastic seamstresses or some craftsmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Our job was, you know, there came the transport from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and brought these magnificent linens. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">The Germans had, it was called Naehstube, <span class="INT_SPACE">sewing room</span> , and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> with measurements and you took this linen, you put it on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , first you measured it how to fold, you know, the measurement were there for right folding, and you checked it for damage or for excellence. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">If the linen was totally new or in good shape, it went to the officers of the highest rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">As they degraded it, so it went to the lower rank officers and then they had women who right away mended it, and my mother was one of the women who mended it. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And they took us twice a week for <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and this was... and we each had our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , I mean, they were still <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> but pillows and sheets and heated. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I mean, unbelievable! </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I thought I'd got into some sanitartum or something, I couldn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But, unfortunately, after being there very brief time I came down with the horrible typhoid fever because we had a lot of lice and the lice are the best to get you that, you know, they go from person to person. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And I ended up in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Now, I was very fortunate that I got it while I was in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> because typhoid, something that spreads 1s assured death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I mean, over the death sentence of being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And I was able to communicate my symptoms to my father because the nurse where I was had a husband who was a nurse in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> where my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And just over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , she was able to give him little slips of paper, and so my father ran into the <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> and found the slides with my typhoid, you know, saying that I had typhoid, and destroyed it so no one could find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Otherwise they would have taken me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And he even got permission from one of the German soldiers to visit me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And I knew when he's coming, so my mother was already, she was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And he brought me some fruit and he gave me a shot, and this is incredible because it never happened before. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He had such ways with people that even the Germans fell under his sort of spell. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And he said, "I know, I have a child too," I know how you feel the guy told him and so he saw me there, and I knew that one of the doctors was not a doctor who was treating me, I could tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And so he asked that someone else could treat me which the real doctor did. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And he took time, of course, to get better in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And I became friends with someone who was hiding there because they wanted to make on her medical experiments and she came in '42, the same time my husband's sister went. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And she had goiter, and one of the doctors that was his specialty wanted to do experiments on her and the girls were hiding her. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So we became very good friends and remained friends until she died, she lived then later in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I am still in contact with her husband and son.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  Were you aware of any of their medical experiments, was that still going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  We heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">We heard about it or from her heard it in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , definitely, I knew about it, yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Well, this I knew, that someone had some sort of cancer, they were trying to do experiments on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And I think they did on ovaries, all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But, I had terrible typhoid, I couldn't say I'm going to make it really, but soon after I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and got back to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , we were told to go out in the middle of the night and stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> to give us extra food and we were marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because 07:27 the Russians were coming, this was in January, 1945, and they didn't want the Russians to find us there and what they did to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And so, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> marched out that night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  Okay, before we get to that, I do have some more questions to ask, I think you had a strategically more of a vantage point, especially with your father in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  I can just tell you that when we had to move out, many of the old timers were thrilled because they never thought they would ever leave that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I don't think I was that thrilled because it was again into unknown, and we had to march real good beat, you know, good pace in the snow and in the cold and I just got out of typhoid and I really sat down in the snow, I didn't want to go on, I just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And that was the only time that I remember that my mother acted as a mother and prompted me to get up and move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">As we walked, again, I was encouraged by one of the guards who asked me, not commanded me, but asked me to go faster because, if you didn't, they had a long stick with a big stone and they cracked your head, and if you couldn't keep up walking at a certain pace 07:34 because they didn't have any more, that many guards, they were at the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">When they killed you, they cracked your head and we saw a lot of dead people in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We were afraid to look, it might be someone you recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We walked like that, there were people, we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plesch</span> ? (</span><span class="sentence" id="822">ph), a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> , and the people there stood because they knew how thirsty we are with buckets, they wanted us to have water, but they didn't let us stop to have the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And we were tremendously thirsty, you know, you walk and walk and you walk like that until eight at night until we got to <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And whoever fitted into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was able to go in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">There were the animals, barn animals were roaming, cows and all, but they didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">There was straw, we were out of the real cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We were afraid to take off our shoes as we could never put them back, you know, they were red and our feet were swollen so we just kept them on and, in the morning, when they opened the <span class="DLF">barn door</span> there were a lot of frozen bodies <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , people who didn't get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And then, we were marching further and transported with the open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , which was almost worse than walking because the cold was just so penetrating, the wind blew all around you, people died right there in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They had no food, the only thing we could collect snow and eat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And in one <span class="NPIP">point</span> the engineer was unusually kind and if he stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> once in a while he would let some of us collect the steam from the engine to make some hot liquid. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">We were transported like that until we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  How long were you marching, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  And the local people saw you going by?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> they didn't because that was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> you know, and...

<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  Didn't see, didn't see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  Okay, so where did they take you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  We came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And they left us stand out, thirsty and hungry, some people had something to deal with and so they got water, or something, but I have nothing to exchange for, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So we just stood and were hungry and thirsty and worn out. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Finally, they let us in, it was called the <span class="BUILDING">Seamen's Barrack</span> , seamen's like you say now, the electric seamen's, and there we sat on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and then at one point, a guard brought a bucket of water and everyone rushed to him to get it and he just spilled 1t out. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I was so mad, and I didn't care, I said, "Why didn't you just kill us, because we going to die anyways?" </span><span class="sentence" id="854">So then he brought more and he let us slowly take, each. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And then, we were distributed into <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It was so crowded at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensburg</span> because they'd brought in from all over there, it was aman...a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ladies camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">That was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep or to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Luckily, I got a <span class="NPIP">place</span> on top someplace with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Snow was falling and it was pandemonium. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Next to us was some German prostitutes with tuberculosis, a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And then they were announcing who speaks languages, particular the languages that I knew because the Germans were very meticulous, everyone had to be registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Exact! </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And so, I was being taken someplace, they gave me a big basin with warm water and soap, I could wash, and started work, you know, asking questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">But then after a few hours when I returned to my own <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I couldn't find my mother, she disappeared! </span><span class="sentence" id="866">So, I thought, I can't leave her by herself, she would wander away you know, and I just gave up the job and usually, I stood for her in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Whatever I could I did for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And after being there few weeks they loaded us on regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and took us farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">We didn't know where, but farther into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And when we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> full of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , normal circumstances would have like it, and our neighbors, this was not a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but amazing but there were a few women in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> who were liberated in this same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and my friends sister too, so it's interesting, probably they got there the same way I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neustadt-Glewe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city,</span> the camp had no name. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They just, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neustadt-Glewe</span> , it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mecklenburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because I saw this signature...
QUESTION:  Is this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  No, it was not. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And there were some laborers, they lived separately, and they were the French prisoners of war, our neighbors, who gave us courage by letting us know where the war is standing, that it's not too distant until liberation, because by then we were so terribly starved that I developed what you call hunger edema, it's... your body, it's not only your stomach, but all the cells in your body are hungry, are malnourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">For instance, if I would stick my hand, they skin wouldn't jump back the hold would just stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And I developed fever, I got like red lines on my legs, it was all from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And so, I knew we couldn't live much longer there, you know, no energy, it was hard to just move or get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">We didn't do work there, but we weren't fed either, I mean, just water, sort of, or liquid. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But then, after it was May, it was actually May 2nd, we looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , it was a lovely day, and we saw our guards looked unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">They were unshaven, they were drunk and they were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So, we sort of knew the end came. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And the French prisoners of war cut through some wires, we were surrounded by . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">they cut the wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Just a couple of days before that or so, a girl was so hungry, you know, there were going <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> which wasn't far from us that had these sugar beets or horse beets, whatever, because we got this soup, this horse beets, maybe that's what it was, and she picks up one that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , you know, it fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And one of the guards just waited until she put it in her mouth and shot her. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And they had potatoes and vegetables dug in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , they made <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">The looked like <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> , there were so many, and they wouldn't give it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And, after we were free, we really didn't feel that free. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">No one came there, none of the American army who freed this <span class="REGION">territory</span> didn't know we existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> wasn't very far, but they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And so, no one came then, we didn't know what's our next move. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Some people became very unhappy and screamed and cried because they just, it just dawned on them that they are left alone, that all their loved ones were killed off and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them to come back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I had my mother to take care of and I had became friends with two other girls, one was from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , one was from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And we befriended each other in this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And they moved out together into the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were occupied before by the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So each had our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and there was one very energetic girl that I met after the war and became friends with and had her mother there too, she had the energy to take a big pot of water and boil potatoes which was the best thing for our stomachs. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Some girls ran into this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> that was there that was loaded with Red Cross packages that was suppose to be given to the French prisoners of war and never was, and they got deathly sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">They got such diarrhea that some died. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">My mother suffered from chronic diarrhea, even from the potatoes, she was so weakened. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And after we were like that, you know, washed ourselves and scrubbed ourselves, we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">My mother was left behind but I went with my two friends into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neustadt-Glewe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And as we were entering the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we saw some, about three or four American Army personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And I spoke English, I wouldn't say I spoke like I do today, but I could be understood and I understood and I spoke well German. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And they were sort of looking around, and there were some German army personnel with them and it seemed like they were looking for something, so I went to them, and I said, "Could I help you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And they said, "Yes, tell them to throw down their arms," which I did with pleasure, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And, as I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I saw even a nicer scene, I saw the American Army on both sides of the time walk and the Germans walking the middle throwing their arms in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And the prisoners made a thing like a carnival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they ransacked the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , they stole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , they just walked on, they thought it belongs to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">They took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby buggies</span> and loaded them with whatever they could take, and I just wondered where they were going with all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">We entered a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> , and you know this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was totally undamaged, the war never entered this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So we entered a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> , the inhabitants were nicely sitting around their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , eating, and the only question was, "Are the Russians coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="914">They were not afraid of the Americans, terrified of the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I said, "We have no idea who's coming, you know, but we would like some food," and they let us go by ourselves in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> that was loaded from floor to top with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And we helped ourselves, with canned things. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And one smart, and there was some fabric, I remember there was a red and white sort of cotton fabric, that my girlfriend from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> she was a fantastic seamstress, she tore it and made a skirt out of it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I came in that skirt back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And one girl was very smart and took couple bottles of drinks, I would have never thought of it, which was very helpful to us because right after the Germans liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , two days later it became the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , and the Russian soldiers were totally ungentlemen-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">They wanted to rape us, no matter what condition we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">We hardly could escape them, and we decided we are leaving, we didn't know how, but we knew that the Americans are next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">We walked out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They wouldn't let us through. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But then when we showed our drinks, the bottle of drinks that pacified them, they let us through. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And we actually, probably came to the <span class="REGION">American Zone</span> again because it interchanged, sort of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">QUESTION:  When you say that the Russians tried to rape you, what does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">ANSWER:  They ran into the <span class="DLF">door</span> , into the <span class="DLF">door</span> and to rape us. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">My mother had to kneel down and beg them to leave me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And then, one got drunk and while he snored, we ran out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">QUESTION:  So nobody was hurt?</span></p>

ANSWER:  So, we walked on this <span class="DLF">highway</span> , we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neustadt-Glewe</span> and we went through the Russian, you know, he let us through. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">It was a hard job, we had to beg him. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But, we got on this <span class="DLF">highway</span> and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> on both sides on this <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Actually, we really enjoyed this walk because it was for the first time that you walked and no one said, Schnell and Raus. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">You don't realize what it 1s, just to walk and no one chasing you. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And then we saw the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , which until then, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had absolutely nothing of nature, and we heard birds that . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">it's so delightful when you haven't heard it for such a long time, just a nice voice instead of those harsh, horrible voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But then all of a sudden we heard shots and we thought, oh God, they're after us now. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">But before we had a chance to be really that scared, we saw American, people in American army uniform running out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they saw us and saw how we looked all scared and, you know, and they said, "It's the end of the War, end of World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">We are celebrating." </span><span class="sentence" id="960">It was May the 8th, end of World War II and they were shooting tn the <span class="DLF">air</span> , celebrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And we walked sort of with them to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludwigslust</span> , the delight of Ludwig, I understand it was a summer place for one of the King Ludwig and you could see his <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> there on top and the American soldiers were in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> so we got right away a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And they went into German, there were only Germans, into one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and asked them to give up one of their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And they brought us some food and some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And I remember going into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it had a little <span class="DLF">pond</span> , sort of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> or <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pond</span> , and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> around it, and I found a book with German poetry, and I just enjoyed sitting on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> reading this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">You know, I haven't read anything for ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So, we didn't know anything about my father and we wanted to go on, you know, get closer to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we found 07:57 some French, you know, liberated French prisoners of war, that had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that is heading toward <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and so we asked them to take us on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Our first stop was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> sort of, that was set up by a, I didn't know then U.S.O. personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">There were women and men and they were serving on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , I remember, with napkins and, you know, it was first normal setting of some kind of a food. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And one soldier who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , I know, I wish I would have remembered his name, gave my mother his food ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">He said he wishes, you know, he hoped that if his mother would need something like that, they would give it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And he gave us a special little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , just a <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> , for us to sleep there. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">But the next day, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> moved on and it stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , which was again I think Eastern... no, actually, it belonged to the English, it was the <span class="REGION">English zone</span> , you know there were so many <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="973">This was the English zone, it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , was right next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , but this was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP Camp</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And they made me a, like the camp translator, so they gave me a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with my two friends and my mother, and I found a doctor who told me the best thing for my mother is toast and tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">They wanted to keep me in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there but I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And there were Czech partisans and Slovak partisans, this is what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> started with. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And there were some who were like in big <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> sleeping in, but we had our little <span class="INT_SPACE">private area</span> which was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And we recuperated, even so I still had that hunger symptoms, this red streak and fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And then I heard that there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and there were Gypsies, many Gypsies in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and a lot of Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And I found out that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> they're sending a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> for some of the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> who were there, prisoners, to bring them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And there were only so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> for, you know, the people were named because there were no gasoline, you couldn't find gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So, I went again to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> whatever, in charge of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> an Englishman, and I said, "Could you do me favor? </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I brought my mother through all this, I don't want her to perish now. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I have to get closer to better health for her, could you get us on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">So we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and actually, I was helpful because they stopped it because they were going from one <span class="REGION">zone</span> to another and they didn't want to let it go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">So then I spoke to them, "Is there any other way?" </span><span class="sentence" id="988">There was a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> so we took the <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> and we got through and I remember, our first night we slept <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and there were some students who gave up their <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to sleep and, I never forget, it was the first fresh coffee for breakfast and some regular breakfast, and then we went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and we were brought the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross building</span> , or where ever the Red Cross was, and they gave us money and food and they had already had posted some people survived, so we looked, you know, any news .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">there was nothing about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So, we slept there one night and headed closer to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So we went on the one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and they had a rule that the first seating went to the survivors, only then could everyone else sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And so we sat down and got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">train compartment</span> was . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">there were besides us, three women, 08:02 all from that <span class="REGION">region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">One woman left behind a husband and child, three years . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">she was three years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and she invited us to her <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">The other one left a husband behind and, so then we came all to her <span class="NPIP">place</span> first, where she left the husband and child. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">It was early morning, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived and we walked to her <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And we see a man turned to the back of us with his Tallith, you know the prayer shawl, praying it was her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And when asked about her child, he said, "Just a minute." </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">He went to the neighbor and brought the child, so they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So this was very good news. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And then, the one young woman who left her husband found her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">There was really just us left, and we walked, we wanted to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">public bath</span> to really wash up and, as we walked, we met a man from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , Mr. Bernfeld, his name was Max Bernfeld, and... a tall man, and he... was surprising that he recognized us the way we looked, and he said, "Why are you so upset?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And we told him we don't know what happened to my father, and he said, "Well, I do." </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And he took from his breast pocket a prescription blank with his name and address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">See, what happened was my father, as dedicated doctor he always was, stayed with his hospital people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Of course, they lined them up to be blasted, but the Russians arrived minutes before it could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">So, instead of in May, he was liberated in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And slowly, he had contracted typhoid too on the way, but he made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poprad</span> ? (</span><span class="sentence" id="1011">ph) where there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that he knew the doctor there, so he was able to recuperate there and make his way back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to, he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , which was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And he, the address was already this man told us, he's practicing in a furnished <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , medicine, so we were able to send him a message right away that we are alive because he didn't think we would be, especially me, he saw me last having typhoid fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And, we went on the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and it was so crowded that I pushed my mother through the <span class="DLF">toilet window</span> in to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because the <span class="DLF">steps</span> were all taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">People were standing on the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and there were many Russian soldiers going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">There were no <span class="DLF">windows</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and so we sat down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> too, we were glad to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> many hours later, it's a short <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride normally, but you know some of the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were torn or ruined so they had to always had to get out and correct them and continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And, when we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , the Jewish community was waiting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">You know, what's sad was no body else but the Jewish community was waiting, there was no one else, you know, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> should have been waiting or, you know, some other people but no, 1t was always the Jewish community who set up the <span class="INT_SPACE">food kitchens</span> and who did everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">It was a Joint Distribution committee who did all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">The people were waiting with makeshift transportation to bring some people who arrived with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had no legs, had no way of walking, they were in a horrible shape, much worse than my mother and I, and so they were waiting for them to transport them to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">food kitchen</span> already set up too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And some had big posters with blown up pictures of 08:07 their lost children or husbands or wives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">The fears asking, "Have you seen this person? </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Have you seen this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">You know, it was a hopeless question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So, we made our way, walking, to my father's address and the landlady hardly wanted to let us in the way we looked, you know, she couldn't believe who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But then I knocked on my father's <span class="DLF">door</span> , but typical of him, he said, "Just a minute, I have a patient I have to take care of right now." </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">So he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1029">QUESTION:  He knew it was you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">ANSWER:  Sure! </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And he then came out and, of course, we were together, which was incredible after all that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">His first job was to delouse me with all kinds of mixtures, then we went to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">But I have to tell you, I never looked full, I ate and ate and I was continuously hungry, there was no end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And then after weeks of this, I finally upset my stomach and I knew this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I filled myself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">My father's birthday was in August and I had nothing else to give him, so I wrote down my entire experience for the year that I was away, totally, and I had total recall at that time, and I forgot all about it, but he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He saved it and I found it after he died among his belongings, which was very helpful to me because I translated it then into English and added many things and now the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> 08:09 has it among their archives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">While we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> I finished the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> and then to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gym</span> they were very tolerate, you know, and I made in one year all six, seventh, eighth grades plus the diploma I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Then, we wanted to go back and my father wanted to resume his practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">So we went back, but we couldn't find . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">we couldn't get back our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was being used by other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Most <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were occupied by people who didn't belong to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">They just took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And, someone who offered my father to put away things, put away so good, that when my father came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , he appeared in my father's suit, shocked that he had returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And this was an old patient of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">The anti-semitism continued, it was not a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, and it was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghost town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">None of my friends were there, most of the Jews weren't there, it wasn't nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And I went and registered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and that's where I met my husband several months later because I needed bones to study for the exam and I never could visualize things, it was anatomy of the extremities, and I had to do good on my examination because they had, the government, Pollack?? </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">government, still had our passbooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">They didn't return our saving books, they just gave out certain portions and if I was a good student and proved it they gave out so I could continue my schooling for the expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">So I had to go every month and pass an exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">So I needed . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I, someone, I was standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> someplace, because you always stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> for something, and one of my colleagues said, "Oh, I know someone who has bones." </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">So I went and knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and, it was a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with a white-haired lady who had a bun on her head and she spoke only Hungarian and it seemed like my husband didn't speak Hungarian so they communicated by singing, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">They sang out their... whatever they had to say to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">He had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , he had no other clothes but this suit hanging on one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hangers</span> you see in the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> floating around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">It was... his bedding was draped and open, I'll never forget the picture of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">It was like... 1t had a skull that he used, I don't know for what reason, and he had a record player and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , and he had bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">That's what I came for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And so... wrapped the bones and it was Christmas vacation so I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the bones to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And my mother always took my laundry when I arrived and she wasn't prepared because this was all wrapped in laundry what was coming out of it, I just heard a big scream, and the bones came out and she felt that I should bring back something in return for the favor, so, she was a fantastic cook and baker so I brought good food back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So, anyways, and I returned with all that good food and I guess love must have been started with his stomach because we started going out together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">There was a big difference in our philosophy - I was religious and brought up religious and he had absolutely no inkling of any of it, and I said, "We can't get serious before . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">either things have to change or something." </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">In fact, I sneaked him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because my mother didn't want to meet him, and it was very funny, she said, "What do I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Who is it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">You know, because in those days somebody had to be something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">He had to either be a finished, what she called a finished person had a degree or a job or something, and he wasn't that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">So, said, "Oh, his name 08:16 is Adam," So at least I can say the first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And then when she saw him, how skinny he is, She took pity on him and he appreciate her food so much, and she whispered to me, because he was so skinny that his Adam's apple would move up and down, his neck, and she whispered to me, "Don't let him take a bath, he might get down with the drain water." </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">So, but, somehow they got to like him and he really, was being taught to be religious, he went and found someone who was teaching him to know some, some basic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And so then we got engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">But I was asked if I want to come by a teacher that I had to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And I did, I didn't want to remain there, even signing on, giving up my future profession because I didn't know what's waiting here for me and my husband says he wants to come too, he has an Aunt here, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , that's how he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">So, he didn't know how to write so I wrote, so I cheated, she thought he was very good in English and he did. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">she know there's some girl involved, she was a... we know and she thought, "Oh,, she's going to have someone living with her and she send him a boat ticket, fancy boat ticket, as soon as she found out the story she removed the boat ticket, withdrew the boat ticket, and he had to come then with a horrible <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , but I was the only one who could come out as a student and my visa was only for eight months and I didn't want to come all by myself but my husband said I should because somebody has to do the foot work for all of them, he was very right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So, I came, I had some relatives that I never met and neither my father but they were kind enough to send me airplane tickets, Pan-American airline was flying and there were only fifty people, that was a very luxuriously thing to come by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> in 1948, and so I came by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">This teacher was waiting for me at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and she took me to her <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> where she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borrow Park</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and she found a job for me, as the lady that I stayed she had a very well-to-do sister who needed sort of a supervisorship, five children, they were going a lot out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and someone who would be supervising that, but I was quite uncomfortable in that position and found a job later on with the Barton Candy people as a governess out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seagate</span> , which is past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coney Island</span> , at that time was a beautiful, private place but it's not anymore, so I spend the summer there, meanwhile, my husband tried to get his visa but his English was not good and they told him to go back and practice 08:13: because as a student he had to know, and I got him the papers to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I came here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , his Aunt was waiting for and she looked scary, I tell you! </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">She had no teeth and she was totally, you know, she never took care of herself, she was frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And she took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> someplace near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Euclid Beach</span> to a little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , sort of, and, but I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Cleveland college</span> , that's where the papers came for my husband, which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> at that time, where the <span class="BUILDING">Society bank</span> is now, and I got him papers to come from there and some other papers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and so, he was able to come about eight months after me, and so, we got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">We got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> eight months after he arrived with some friends, at the wedding there were about 35 people, some from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I have some pictures of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I frankly don't know where the wedding took place, some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span> , I see in the photograph some linen hanging <span class="NPIP">outside</span> so probably that's where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And it was in a rickety sort of little <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> and started our life in a furnished, ugly little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">QUESTION:  When you came over here, I'm sure everything seemed quite different to you, do you remember what your first impressions were?</span></p>
