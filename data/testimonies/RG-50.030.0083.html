<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Well, we were seven children and I was next to the last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I was sixth. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was a happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We didn't really have much but, you know, as a family we... enjoyed my grandparents and my uncles and my sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was a...1t was a very happy ' <span class="REGION">Carpathian Ruthenia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Prior to World War II, this was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">After the war, it became the <span class="REGION">Transcarpathian Oblast</span> of the Ukrainian SSR. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Tell me what you did growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I did everything that a normal child would do; played with my neighbors and...uh... sust..... was just a happy child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Tell me about some of your memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  As a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Well, my memories were very, very good until I.... I was together with my family and with my neighbors and everybody else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But then we were occupied by the Hungarians and a few years later we were occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So when the Germans came in, this is when I started seeing and feeling different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Now the difference was that we weren't allowed to go out at night anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We weren't allowed to go shopping, only at a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But it didn't take long, maybe six weeks after the occupation by the Germans, that we were rounded up and we were taken to a...uh....<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And that is to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uzhgorod</span> [Czech: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U_horod</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">That was the capital of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Now that was something that was horrible in my life and actually what happened was maybe four weeks after the Germans were there, they took my brothers and my father away and they told us that they're going to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">You know, that they weren't going to be in the army, but they gonna be working. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So my mother and, and us children--my grandparents were there--left. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">A few weeks later after they took my father and my two brothers away, this 1s when they rounded us up and...and took us to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it was, you know, we were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , on concrete, but we had blankets that we took from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when we left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They ...uh...told us that we can...we've got to leave everything except only what we can take with ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So I remember my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He was...uh...a very old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He was past 80. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And he had a box...he had a Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I don't know how to explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The Ten Commandments or whatever...a Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And he did not want to leave it because he felt that wherever he is going to be, we will be needing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">How can we live without it? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So, we had to deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We...we wrapped that Torah up and we carried it with us. (</span><span class="sentence" id="49">Sigh) When we got to...uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the older people were using it. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You know, they were still very religious and they felt that this Torah perhaps is going to save us or the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  How did they carry the Torah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  We carried it in...by...1n our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">You know we wrapped it up in sheets and whatever we had and we just carried it with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But when we got to the...when we got to the...you know, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , every day it was somehow worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Sometimes they wouldn't let us have water. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Sometimes they wouldn't let us get out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and what we lived on is on soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They gave us soup and...and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So that in itself was a horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But still you were with the family, especially me as a young adolescent. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I wasn't paying much attention to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  How old were you at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  I was between 13 and 14 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But then all of a sudden they, the Germans, you know, came on the loud speaker and they told that every older Jew that has a beard and he's got to report to a certain <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And, of course, we didn't know what will happen there with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So my mother went along with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  With whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  With my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a...a prayer shawl, a tallis [NB: tallith] they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So they made these men put on these _ tallisen, these prayer shawls, and they told them to start praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And while they were praying, they started beating on them and they started cutting their beards. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So my poor grandfather... and my...my mother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his rescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...1f you go near there. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So this poor old man had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of the beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So he continued crying for a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So she told...she gave him a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on his hat, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And that's how he walked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">First of all, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to see himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So we stood in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a few weeks and then when they got enough people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , for a full <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> load... It took about another six weeks to get these people together from all these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And they gave us...they lined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they told us they're relocating us. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And they gave us a bucket there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , it was so packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person on...on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So...then when we were packed into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> they locked the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we stayed in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> until it...1t was midnight and midnight the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started going. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">It was really, really chaotic there <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We didn't know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So it...you know, it was so noisy and it was so tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I...I don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of older people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So they were laying there with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and we really didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The thing is that they...these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , they had <span class="DLF">windows</span> on top, small <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's shoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So as we were driving through the <span class="REGION">country side</span> I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see what's going...what's...what's going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I saw the farmers showing to me like this (finger across throat). </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I...I really didn't know what they were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And...and a young adult it yust didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But it was strange to see these farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They were all showing like this (finger across the throat). </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I told my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I told my mother that that's what they were showing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Well, anyway when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> it sort of didn't sink in. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I didn't expect that I was brought to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I just didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the SS with the dogs were standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a very big flame. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And it smelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And the SS were screaming, "Heraus! </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Heraus! </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Heraus!" "</span><span class="sentence" id="110">Get out! </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Get out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Some of them were trying to go out and whoever couldn't go out, they were helping each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Like my sister...I had two sisters coming with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">One was holding on to my grandmother because she was old and she couldn't walk very well, so she was trying to help her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My mother was holding onto my brother and sort of trying to hold on to me to. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But what they did is they pulled my brother away from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They...they pushed my brother to the left and my mother and my other sister and me to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So my little brother noticed that my mother is going a different way so he started running after her and they started beating on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And my mother heard his voice so she was...she looked back, so she was running back to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then they started beating on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So she was pleading. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She went on her knees pleading to that SS man to please let me go for this is my child and he won't be able to survive without me. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He's so little. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He was six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So after they beat her up, they pushed her to the left with my brother and there I remained with my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We were trying to run with my sister...my mother too but they wouldn't let us because when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they already needed a manpower. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Of course, at that time we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So they wouldn't let us. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we looked pretty...you know, we looked pretty healthy yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So they wouldn't let us run to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So they started beating on us, on my sister and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And my sister says to him, "You know, something smells terrible here." </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He says, "Well, we're just roasting pigs." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And...uh...then you see these mothers coming down with little kids and they're...they're trying to pull these kids out of their mother's hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And, you know, when you try to separate a family, it's very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It's very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">People put up fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It...1t was so much screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I remember that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So the parents, the...the mothers that wouldn't give up these children and they were beaten up and the kids got hurt, so they grabbed these kids and they threw them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they really didn't look how they throwing them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So at that time we saw that something horrible is happening the way these people were behaving to little children, to little babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And, of course, on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> there were people, you know, very sick people going, you know, they were throwing sick people there and...and...and these children that gave them a tough time. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They were just thrown on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And there were so many mothers that were running after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and of course they beat them and they pushed them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So that was the opening of these...of these <span class="DLF">train doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">This is the first thing that I have seen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  Go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Keep talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Tell..tell me more about...tell me more about what happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">What happened with the--?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So...uh...that...that big fire so maybe being that my sister and I was so young, it was like scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It was...felt like you're going into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And as we were walking, the people that worked there, they told us... they told us that they're gas...you know, they're...they're gassing more people than they can burn in the crematortum so they had to...they have to burn them in the <span class="DLF">pits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And we still...we thought that some person is just being cruel telling us that. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So...and we walked, we walked, you know, they had a long <span class="DLF">line</span> of young people walking and as we were approaching these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there, there was...we heard music. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">There was a man is telling us that they are burning people because they can't burn them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They can gas more than they can burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And here we hear music! </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was very, very confusing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">When we got closer, our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...a...a... a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or whatever you want to call it, opened up and they told us to undress. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And, of course, you know, the SS were walking around there and there was so many girls that didn't want to underess completely and they started beating on them and they had to get undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then they started shaving our heads and...uh...1 remember staying there and these SS walking around us and if the girls would put down their heads, just trying to, just trying to hide, they would come up and they would take their whip and they would pull their heads up like this with the whip and they would look at us and then they would start whipping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we...we felt that there is something terrible going on but we didn't, still didn't think that maybe people are being put into a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So then we took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and they gave us a...uh...a striped dress and they gave us wooden clogs and that striped dress had a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And that took place during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We kept on asking where's...where's my little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Where's my mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Where's the rest of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Because we thought we'll meet someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They didn't...you know we...they separated us right and left, my mother and my brother and my grandmother and my grandfather, my family went to the left and my sister and I were the only one from my family that I found myself with so we kept on asking each other where...where is the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And then when they gave us the dress and they lined us up after a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You know, by the time they shaved a thousand girls' heads, it takes a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And...uh...1t was...it was at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I remember it was at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And they let us into our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They...you know, they took us to our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">When we got to that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , there were, you know, like on the bottom there was three...uh...three different parts to that...to where we had to go and sit down or lay down. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So I was on... remember, on top of that thing...on top of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or whatever you would call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And I would just sit there and my sister and we...we had...we were six girls to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...uh...maybe that...that wide, and we would have to just lay there and we were just wondering what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We just...we couldn't figure it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were made...they were made out of wood and there were cracks between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So early in the morning they took us out around 4 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It was dark yet and I wasn't looking around too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So they let us stay there for an hour and they were counting us and...uh...after they count us they told us we can go back in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That was the first night. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That was the first morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">When we got back in it was already about, you know, daylight and I took a look through the cracks and I saw people hanging on these <span class="DLF">wire fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It was such a terrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I wasn't...1 just wasn't prepared for all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I say to my sister, "Look what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">You know, look what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">People are...are hanging on these <span class="DLF">fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They're dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They were got electrocuted because many of them...some of them were aware of the <span class="DLF">electric fences</span> and some of them thought maybe they want to escape or to go look for their parents or go look for their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So they...they were hanging there. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We were in all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">All day we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">In the morning they gave us some soup and all day we were there and wondering what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And, of course, we were locked in from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> so there was no way to get out to see where we are, what's happening, what's going on because... because whatever happened, whatever they did with us, it was always during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So at night they...they brought in some bread and they gave us a slice of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And again during the night they were taking us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It was also again a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So we got to this <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> everybody in... There was water. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So everybody was trying to wash their faces or go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , but it was...those... those Kapos...you know, these Kapos were people that were taking care of us, watching over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They started beating us like if...you know, I remember I sit down to want to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> like a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It was...and she started beating on me because she thought I was there too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I was black and blue from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">My sister got me to..to where the water was running and she was trying to wash me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And that was the experience the first day, first... second day. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And...uh ... finally, you know, after everybody sort of got their beating, knowing, you know, saw how we were treated, they lined us up again and they took us back to that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And that was during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">The next day, again, they got us out at 4 o'clock and they told us to stay for an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So the next day, the people that were a little bit weaker couldn't stay for an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They couldn't stay for an hour so they sort of like collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So what happened was they came and they pull these girls out, these people out and they...also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came and they threw them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And...uh...when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we never...we never knew where these people are going once they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Because I think if a lot of people they would have known once they get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that they'll never see the light again, I think maybe they would have tried harder right at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But...uh... they didn't know so they...that's how it was going on for about... was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for about five weeks with this routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And...uh...every morning, they just pulled other...other people out because they just..they just ..some of them were just giving up somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">You know, they ...the beating was...was So bad that I think they just didn't wanta live right of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They just didn't wanta a go through everyday this...this beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So...so we were weeded out, but thank God, one day a Kapo came in and said that we have to line up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">That was after already we were lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And they looked everybody over. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Whoever looked strong enough to them, they again put them to the right and me and my sister was put to the right and then other girls were put to the left and they...the girls from the right were taken away, and the girls from the left stayed...stayed where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And they put us in another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with...by the time we got there, there were already other girls there. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And during the night, they took us to the...to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But we recognized the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> because when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I remember the sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">The sign said...uh...uh... "Arbeit macht das Leben suf." </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I don't know if you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It said that "work makes...uh...uh...life happy [sweet]"...something like that.7 So when we got to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , we were glad that...we felt we were going to get out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; because, as you know, I mean, getting out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> by a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and not by <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So we were...we were maybe a thousand girls there. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And they...again they put us into...uh...to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And we stayed in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , you know, the rest of the night and during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> didn't move, but we were locked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Yal, they also gave us a bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And during the night...during the night, we heard like bombs were exploding and that noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We were...we were...we were kinda happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We were...we were figuring maybe they're going to bomb the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and these people aren't going to be coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Because I left some uncles and aunts in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and a lot of my family in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So I...you know, I was talking to my sister and the other girls and we were saying, "Oh, My God, they're gonna...they're bombing the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We weren't * Possibly "Arbeit Macht Frei"; "Work makes one free." </span><span class="sentence" id="250">moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The bombing the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> in...you know, the family we left behind isn't going to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But...uh... that...that was maybe for an hour, an hour and a half, that noise constantly...constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And all of a sudden it stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It stopped and we're sitting there in that railroad...in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">In the middle of the night all of a sudden...and we thought that maybe that...that it was bombed and that's why they're not taking us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But in the middle of the night, again, we started off. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We went...they ...they...you know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And so when we also didn't know, you know, where we're going or what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They didn't tell us what was happening to us, what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So...uh...but we were stronger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We were, you know, we were weeded out. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We were healthier. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We were healthier. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So we were just trying to talk and figure out what this world is coming to, what's happening, and that...you know, you didn't see anybody saying anything except the beatings and...and the brutalities and...(sigh)... Finally, after a couple of days we wound up...it...1t was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and, again, we were walking from these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and they took us in again to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but...but it was smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It was a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And they put us into these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> again and they gave us some soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And the next day, again, they putting us out and they told us to get out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">For a hour we had to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> and they were counting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And after that they gave us a slice of bread and some soup and they told us to march. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And we...we marched and marched maybe for an hour and we got to a <span class="BUILDING">munition factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">When we got to the <span class="BUILDING">muniton factory</span> , they took these girls and placed them in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And they placed me near a... uh... near a...uh...like...1it was like a pump, to pump the explosive into bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They were maybe [motioning] that tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I had to do it so fast that it was going with the machine and as the machine was working, I had to work with the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So, of course, in the beginning 1t was okay because I still wasn't that weakened. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But after awhile, you know, the little bit of hair that we had became red from the poison, from that gunpowder. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Our eyes were yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Our bodies were yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The reason why is because we worked night shifts and day shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So the night shift, and we worked the night shift, they closed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> so we had no circulation. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So this poison was going into our system. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">When we worked during the day, it wasn't too bad because the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So there weren't that many girls that were falling, but during the night is when a lot of girls just fainted and just... just died because the body was full of poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Well, anyway, we were working there for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We got weakened and my sister...she's two years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And at that time I just felt mentally that I can't go on anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Besides physically...I was physically broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So what she would do is she would give her slice of bread and she would...uh...she would say, "No, you're not gonna die. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You're not gonna leave me here alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Your not gonna die." </span><span class="sentence" id="295">She...uh ...she was like afraid of being alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So...so I was trying to hold on to my life because I saw what she care...you know, the way she carried on. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">When we were walking back and forth to work...you know, it was an hour's walk, maybe more...and it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So whenever we could pick up, like a rotten potato or something we would pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Or if we would find paper...1f we would find paper, we would put in into the...uh...into that dress that we had so that we should keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And, of course, if we could find a rag on the <span class="DLF">road</span> sometimes, we would secretly want to pick it up and tie it to our clogs because at that time it was already snowing there in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> and the clogs were falling off our feet and we ...1f we wouldn't pick them up quick enough, then we would be walking barefooted. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So...uh...1 remember one time...uh...we were walking on one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and Russian soldiers and French soldiers... The reason why you knew they were Russian and French soldiers is because they let them...they were prisoners and they let them wear the uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It's just that the buttons I remember were off. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They had no buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And...uh... the men...they were...uh..., you know, big men with these big hats and we...we were trying to figure it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We thought they were Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So...uh...believe me they looked like they suffered, but evidently what happened was they must have gotten more food than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So a French soldier threw some bread across the <span class="DLF">street</span> into our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So the girl that was lucky was there and she picked it up, but the SS saw that she grabbed that bread and he started beating on her and beat on her and beat on her until she no longer could, you know, so she fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And we just walked away, and we never saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But that would even happen if some girl would pick up...[ mean when we...when we wanted to pick up something from...that was laying on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , that... that would have to be like, you know, that the SS shouldn't see. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">You would have to look around and see because if they found you picking this up, you know, you were beaten up and it depended how strong you were whether you can take that beating or you can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So...uh...and the girls were starting to get weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">You know, after...after awhile, you just can't take that punishment, the physical and the mental it's just...1t's just you can't go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We were there for a long, long time...for a long time going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It was may...it was maybe 500 girls left at that time in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> ...in our...in our,...uh...you know, in our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And as weaker as we were getting, we were trying to...we were trying to help each other sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So...the S...so the SS had one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> that the girls worked in...1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , cooking for the SS people and us, we had another <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It was, you know, cooked soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So there was a girl in..in my...happened to be in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">She had a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">She was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">She worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">SS kitchen</span> so, you know, she...she was surviving all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But her sister wasn't surviving too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So she sneaked some bread and brought it to her sister and they sort of...the Kapo caught her taking that bread to her sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Well, they were both...both beaten up right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And then they ordered all of us to come out and they took both of these girls and they hung them there on the gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I...I remember I still if I have nightmares, these faces come in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">If I think back on them I just, you know, I think they were trying so hard to survive and, therefore, they were punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And they were so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They were so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And that was going on, but...uh.... Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I don't want to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Take your time. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Take your time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  I'll take a little bit of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I feel we were still perhaps treated better than a lot of them because we worked...because we worked, but still, you know, after awhile you just can't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">You know, you can't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So again, I... couldn't get up in the morning anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And my sister would come and just literally stand me up because she knew that if I'll remain in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that I'll just disappear...that, you know, she'll never see me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So she would stand me up and she would hold me up for the hour that we would have to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It was so cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And then she would drag me to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">She would actually drag me to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And she would do her work and she would try to do my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And...uh...1t was...I just felt that I am not going to make it there in the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But then all of a sudden, it was a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It was maybe nine months, a year, and we were already...we didn't look like people. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We looked, you know, with...with deep red hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I...It was like an orangey red hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Our bodies were yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We were very skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I weighed maybe 70 pounds, 60 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">You know, I just didn't look human anymore and I was burned up with that gunpowder. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">It was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">That gunpowder is hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So I was...my body was burned with the gunpowder. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And one day...one day they came...they let us stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They didn't take us to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So what happened was they bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Every night when we were there, we were praying, praying they should bomb this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , this <span class="BUILDING">munition factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Even though we were there, they never let us out when the bombing was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They never let us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They just locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But we...we didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We almost felt well, you know, we...we won't live through it anyway, might as well go. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But...uh...one day, it just so happened when we weren't there, that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So that was the day when they gave us off. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And next day they took us to...make... they told us that we're not going to work anymore in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They didn't tell us it was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But they told us we won't...we won't be able to go there, but we're going to work someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So they took us to work on a <span class="DLF">road</span> , to build a <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Which was better because on a <span class="DLF">road</span> you were on the fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And...uh ...you know, you tried doing as much as you can and even...you know, even if sometimes you got a...a...a whip, you could have, you know, you...you sort of overcome it faster than working constantly in this poisoned atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But still we worked on that <span class="DLF">road</span> maybe...uh...you know, a...a few months and again they locked us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They locked us into this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We were...we were very few left. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">We were maybe 200, maybe 200 left. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And...uh...we were locked in from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and...and nobody came at 4 o'clock to open up this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So...uh...we...we got scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We figured what they'll do is just destroy us in this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And...uh...nobody came and nothing is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The SS we don't...we looked through the cracks and we don't see a soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And we were there a day and a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Nobody bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Then middle of the day we see some civilians came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , with an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they opened up our..uh.... you know, our...uh...barrack and they said that we weren't needed there anymore and they're taking us to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So they put us on that open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and as I said, we got there, there was maybe about...maybe a thousand, twelve hundred girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">When we...when we left there, there was an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full, maybe 200 girls, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And they didn't tell us where we were going, but they put us in that open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and that was civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">There...there were no SS men, and they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ...uh...you know most of the people would have to stay in. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And we were thrown in in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">My God! </span><span class="sentence" id="394">There were all kinds of dead people laying there and the smell of dead people...uh... People that lost their minds from all this going through already....uh...the way they looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I mean we didn't look so good either because we...we were a different color. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We were yellow and we had orange red hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We...we... we looked like to them probably also like we're not from this <span class="NPIP">planet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Well, anyway they were infected with typhus already. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So we were laying there and...uh...also got you know, we also got soup in the morning, but we didn't get the bread anymore in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we were there for a few weeks, a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Uh, my sister got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">She was the strong one and I was the sick one and she got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Evidently what happened she was... she was infected with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">She got the typhus, got to her faster than to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So she had high fever and...uh...and I saw that she was talking deliriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">She...she...she no longer spoke, you know, normally and she was laying near the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and she says to me, "You know [...I see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> coming down." </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And I thought she was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I thought she was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">She was dreaming...she's delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I did...wasn't moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I wasn't moving because....then all of a sudden, the noise from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , that scared me actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So I moved over to see through these cracks and when we saw it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and that was the English...the English with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And they opened up these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And when they opened up these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, they were just staring at us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We stared at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">A lot of them...the...the girls that had the strength to get up did and were running over to these soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Prob...you know, probably a lot of them got scared because we looked so horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And a lot of them were sick, you know, going... So they were looking at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">We were looking at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We didn't know what to make out. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We didn't know it was the liberation army. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We just didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But they weren't hitting us, so we...we thought at least, you know, they're not hurting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And my sister...uh...was laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">She..she wasn't happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">She wasn't sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And I was looking at my sister and I saw the end is coming to...you know here. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And then I looked at these people and I felt My God, there're not hitting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Maybe they can help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But I saw that time is going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So what happened was they took...you know, after a day or so, they...they made <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , you know, on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They took <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they made like <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and they were trying to save the ones that are still breathing. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So they came and they picked...they came with these red, you know, there were little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with red...red crosses and they picked my sister up and there here I wanted to go with her but they wouldn't let me go with her because she was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And...uh...they took her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So, there I was by myself and I couldn't move too much, but the English were starting to give us already at least food. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And I couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I couldn't eat much so I...I maybe would eat a slice of bread, but I couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But the people that could...you know, that they wanted to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They wanted to save themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They starting eating and then they got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">They got sick and they got diahhrea and oh, what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So finally when [...when I saw my sister isn't coming, I felt that I need to go and look for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I... wanted to take a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And there were, you know, there were mountains of corpse just laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But what...what's happening when we got liberated, there were...uh...organizations like the Hias, they asked us our names and so I figured...and we gave them our names. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So I figured I am going to find my sister's name somewheres because when they had these <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> after the liberation, they had there a plaque with names, the ones they knew that they died after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So I...so I went over to one big, you know, it was like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> with corpses and I started reading hopefully that I will find my sister's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">At least I will know where she is, you know, and...uh...I didn't find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And that's what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I just remember all these corpse. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">This mountain of corpse. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And I evidently blacked out because that's all I remembered from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">What... Shall I continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  What they did after they got themselves a little organized is that they...they went around with these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and they picked up everybody that was breathing, hopefully that they will save and they probably picked me up but I don't remember where it was and how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But I was 1n this <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span> for weeks with a high fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I also got typhus and...uh...after a few weeks, you know, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I sort of...uh...was surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I was surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And the first thing when my fever broke a little bit, my...my first question was, "Where is my sister?" </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So they started asking me...uh.... what happened to her? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So I told them that, you know, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They came and they just, you know, she was very sick and they took her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And after awhile, after, you know...uh...I remember it was a week or so, maybe more, somebody...and I was getting a little better, they came and told me that my sister did survive from all...from.... So anyway, then they right away reunited us. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So we were in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> still for a long time because we were very, very sick and...and that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And then all of a sudden they came to tell us that...uh...1f we wanta go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , we could go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslavakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But we were very weak and we were verty...uh...we just...we didn't know what we want. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We didn't know what we want. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And we knew we couldn't go there on our own because we were very weak, so we didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So we remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And then the Swedish Red Cross offered to take in some survivors, the sick ones, the real sick ones and...uh...they...they took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">When they took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ...uh...we still looked like...like corpse. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We still didn't have hair and I was full of sores. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Uh...And people were coming over to...uh...to us...to...to...to comb...to...to touch us and we...we again would look at them like: "My God, aren't they afraid of us? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Look how we look." </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They were very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They were... they were just very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And we were in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We were in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I remember they gave us root beer to drink and I didn't want to drink it and they said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Drink it. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Drink it. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That'll make you feel better." </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And, you know, a person that wants to survive, I was drinking the beer. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> where I really came to myself at ..at... You know I felt again like I...uh.... am sort of human. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I think...uh...and, of course, at that time I was already, you know, a little bit older and I started looking at this world and trying to figure it out, what had...what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So picking up the pieces here and there, I recognized that we were there alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We knew...at that time we already figured out what has happened to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">But up until then, to tell you the truth, we didn't allow ourselves to think that they would take all these kids that came with me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> ...my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother and the family that came with me, that these were the ones who went to a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> to be gassed for no sin committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So that was difficult for me in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to deal with. (</span><span class="sentence" id="493">Sigh) They put me into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they start, you know, we were... It was like a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We worked a half a day and a half a day we...we studied. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And life was very good, but it was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So we had some people talking to us and we had so many questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They...uh...they were doctors who were talking to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They were very careful on how they are letting us in on it, but still the bottom line was that we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We lost everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So my sister and I was left and then, again, they were trying...what they were trying to do after the war is get families together and I remember...I remember a...when I was little that I had a sister that went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So they asked me do I know about a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I says, "Yes, I had a sister, that she went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and she lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I gave them their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And...uh...they put our names in a paper in here...in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> so...probably in the Brooklyn paper or whatever, and a friend called up my sister that she...because my sister would talk about her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">She wonders whether she'll see them or anybody will be left or what's happening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And...uh...that friend calls her up and says, "You know, I saw two names--Liebowtiz names--in the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Maybe you should call up the Red Cross and they might be able to give you some information where they come from." </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And my sister did that and they were in touch with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And...uh...after a short while they got us reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They brought us here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And this is how we...I got here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Where did you come to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and with my sister, and we lived with my sister for awhile and then, of course, I got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Was your sister married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  My sister was here was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Uh...what I have is a lot, you know, being that I speak...I couldn't talk about it for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I did not talk about it for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And...and I...I think...I...[ made a decision when I had my first child that I will not talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">The reason why I didn't want to talk about it is because I was afraid I will talk about it so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">What I...[...1 am telling you is just highlights of certain days, not day by day. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And...and to me it was if..1f my kids will hear what I have gone through that Hitler will get to them too and I wanted sort of like save them from, from that and, therefore, I didn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I didn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They...uh...they guessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They... they knew that something isn't right because during the day I could control my emotion and I was busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I was very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I was trying to raise a family and so I could control what's there behind my head, the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But sometimes I would just go in and cried for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">That there was nothing to...I could do stop and they always felt well did they do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">DId they annoy me? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And I kept on reassuring that they didn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It's just that I just don't feel good when they were little. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So they knew that it...1t wasn't...that I wasn't sort of completely a normal.... It wasn't a normal situation because they couldn't figure out why I would be like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And then sometimes which you cannot control is the nightmares, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">The nightmares you can't control. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So...uh...in the beginning we lived in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and...uh...you know the kids could hear me scream and my husband would wake me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But at...but by the time my husband got me up...really got me up so I don't really that I should be up. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">It took a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">In the meantime the kids heard my screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And so. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But they knew that they cannot talk to me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So this is how they knew what was happening, but I didn't talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  When you came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , did you talk about it with your sister who lived here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  To my sister, it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">What happened was when we came here and we saw children on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">They were running around and they played in the <span class="BUILDING">playgrounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And we say the people and they...you know, I keep on asking are they Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Are they Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Because I thought all the Jews...that happened to all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And they says, "Yeah." </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So, you know, we had to deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">You know that there are Jewish kids that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And...uh ...1t...you know, it also...I...you know, I had to have help because of the nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">The nightmares were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">The nightmares were very exhausting. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And you can't control them. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">You cannot control a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And, again, I stayed with my sister and she had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So it was like a...like a continuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was like a continuation of it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="562">long, long pause) So that's...that's the way I lived until, you know, I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I met my husband and started having my own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And...uh... I said I have to be strong and...uh...you know, I...[ made a comm... I feel I brought my children into this life that I owe them something that I need to bring them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And to tell you the truth, I was so many times past my...you know what what was passing my mind is I'll bring up my children that will be different than the people with dealt with me because the people that dealt with me reacted like not people. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Not human! </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I worry...I mean...I...I really thought about it all the time how my kids will be brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Will they be different people? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Will they be different? </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And I so much wanted them to be different than what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So I think I concentrated on that a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I, because it was with me constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I...1 was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I..I...1 do have...uh...1 brought up three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I don't know if I should talk about them or I shouldn't? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION

<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  Well, what I would like to...uh...say is the reason why I...uh...decided talking about it because I really think it's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I know I cannot bring back my family, my little brother, the million and a half children that were destroyed, that were gassed, but perhaps maybe I could reach some people that make them understand that this did happen and it can happen again if we are not going to be if we are not going to be aware of our surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I...I think that every person...every person on earth should examine this, what has happened in the Holocaust because a thing like that can happen again and we need to watch that it shouldn't never happen again to no minority, to no minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And therefore I feel I need to get this across to the world, maybe to...even to our future generation and tell them that this cruelty has been done to people from other people and to watch out. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I...uh...1 have nine grandchildren and there're all great, but one of them is a little bit gifted and when I look at him and I say to myself, "I have so much hope in him that he might do something good with being that he's got so much ability, something good for society." </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And then when I look at him and then I think of my brother, little brother and all these other kids, I say to myself, "My God. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Who knows what these kids would have been...what they would have accomplished if they would...1f they would be given a chance just to live...just to live." </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So therefore I think every child on earth should be given this chance just to live and prove itself and not so brutally being destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  Thank you very very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  I also would like to add to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I speak in the <span class="BUILDING">Children's Center</span> and I come up with many children and they have many questions and I like children. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Children are curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And they also come in with mothers or with some chaperons and I talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So after I get finished talking to the children, the parents or the chaperons come over to me and they ask me questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And the reason why I want to tell this little story is because I feel I reached a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">A lady came over to me and she says to me, "You know my father was a SS person and he said it wasn't that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So I looked at the lady and I felt that I need to get something across to her and she should make her own mind on how bad and how good it was so I stopped for a second and looked at her beautiful children. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I said to her, "You know the SS people were volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They were volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The SS were the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that lived on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> with their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They had better <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and nobody threatened their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But they were...their job was to take innocent kids and older people ...sick people, all kinds of people, escorting them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And then after the job was done, they went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to play with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So what can I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You'll have to figure it out how bad it was." </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And I could see...I really have a lot of respect for that lady that she was trying to find the truth I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">She was searching. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">She was trying to hear everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And I am hoping that she found the truth and that she...uh...will be able to make decisions accordingly and for the people around her you know that she...and with her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I...I feel that it can be done when you raise children to bring them up and show them right from wrong because my kids they would tell me always, "Well, Mom when I grow up, you'll be so proud of me." </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I says, "Honey, I am already proud of you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">You...you're the best and the finest." </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And...uh...we never told them what they should do in their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We never did because we felt they are individuals and they need to do what they need to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So the oldest...the oldest one is doing research and even today, when she...you know, she does something good...something comes across, she loves to share it with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">She says, "You know, Ma, I told you I will try, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We'll do something to better humanity." </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And...uh...my younger daughter, she...uh...teaches children that have...uh...have a problem and she too tries so hard...I think she too tries so hard to...uh...to make me feel that she 1s doing something good or right or whatever you would call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And...uh...my son..our son...he...uh...he is a gastroenterologist; and so I feel like God took away a lot from me, but God gave me a lot back. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And in...and what I wanted to achieve in life after the Holocaust I hope and I think I maybe achieved it by looking at my kids, what they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And...and you know, having my grandchildren and they...they too are nice and hopefully, they'll...they'll do something good for humanity and not for destruction.</span></p>
