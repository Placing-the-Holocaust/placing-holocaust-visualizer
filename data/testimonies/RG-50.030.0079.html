<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Uh, my father and mother were immigrants from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Uh, they lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ia_i</span> , where they knew each other as children, but did not, uh, really get to know each other well until they met in the east side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , when they both immigrated over approximately, uh, in 1912. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uh, they met, fell in love and were married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And what was it like growing up in that <span class="BUILDING">household</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What was your childhood like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  My childhood was, uh, I thought, uh, delightful. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh, we were, uh, a lower income family, but I wasn't even aware of, uh, higher incomes or low incomes. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I had, uh, uh, a fine time. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I was a, a strong young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was athletic. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh, my grandmother and grandfather owned a <span class="BUILDING">tenement house</span> in which we lived and, uh, my grandmother kept a kosher home. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Uh, my grandfather was a tailor, and very often he'd bring, uh, work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and on, on Sundays, uh, I might see him at his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> , uh, hunched over the machine--he was a rather large man--uh, working to support, uh, his own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And, uh, it was a six-family, uh, <span class="BUILDING">tenement house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and, uh, four members of the family occupied four of the six <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">How did you, uh, as a young man, a young boy, when did you start getting interested in sports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Well, I was always interested in sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh, I was always the fastest kid on the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I, I became interested in sports, uh, when I lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> when I was five years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I remember, uh, the bigger kids on the <span class="DLF">block</span> would, uh, have me race, uh, all the other kids around the <span class="DLF">block</span> , uh, and, uh, the race was for them to run in one direction around the <span class="DLF">block</span> and I'd run in the other direction, and the first one back at the <span class="DLF">starting corner</span> would be the winner, and I could win handily. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I could win all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I was easily the fastest kid on the <span class="DLF">block</span> , and my father was, uh, a runner also, of sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Uh, not formally as I was, but, uh, he was also probably the fastest kid in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in Ia_1, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh, I began doing more than running when, uh, at the age of six or seven, began to throw a ball around, a punch ball, or we'd play stick ball and punch ball and all the sports that, uh, kids played in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh, "Johnny on the pony," "chase the white horse," and games like that, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and, uh, when I went to, uh, uh, <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> I won, uh, uh, my, uh, first trophy which was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> 's athletic league pin--a small silver pin which I still have, uh, for doing a variety of things like, uh, running quickly against time, uh, standing broad jump, uh, the, uh, rope climbing, things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  What other kinds of sports did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Uh, I did all sports in season. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I did, uh, join the basketball season, I shot baskets and played basketball. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">During the football season I played football. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">In the spring I, uh, played baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I swam in the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I'd take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> on <span class="DLF">Coney Island Avenue</span> , and go, uh, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coney Island</span> --which might have been twenty minutes away by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> --and swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And, uh, I always ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Uh, running was part of all those sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I continued to be the fastest kid around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Uh, at what point did your running become serious in the sense of joining track teams?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I think it became seri...uh, serious in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> when I won, uh, various field days, uh, where the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> competed within itself and I would win the sixty-yard dash or the seventy-yard dash, and I'll never forget my homeroom teacher, uh, writing in, uh, the, uh, autograph book we had when we were graduated from <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> , at the end of the sixth year in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh, he'd been a track man at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yale</span> , and he was my homeroom teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And sometime around, uh, 1930 he wrote, "Be seeing you in the 1936 Olympics.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And here I was, uh, maybe twelve years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And he wrote that; and I still have it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  What happened, where did you choose to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Where did you end up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Well, I...1 went to <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was, uh, a fairly well known <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> athlete in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I played football for an undefeated, uh, city championship and _ state championship team and I was, uh, the star of the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was a tailback in a single-wing formation and, uh, I was a triple threat: I could pass, I could kick, and I could run; particularly run. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And we defeated every other team on our schedule. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Uh, beat a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Roosevelt High School</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> for the city championship, and we, uh, uh, were accorded the accolade of being the best team in <span class="REGION">New York State</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We were invited to play in, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> against a Miami team, but, uh, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , uh, forbade our going down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> because it was too far a trip and, uh, would interfere with our school work. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But we were good and, uh, I was judged, uh, the most valuable player in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time as a football player. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And I, uh, competed in track and <span class="DLF">field</span> , and I won city championships and state championships and, uh, a national scholastic championship and, uh, also played a season of basketball at James Madison High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So I had a, my childhood was fun, uh, for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My father had a tough time; those were depression years. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Uh, his business failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh, he went into bankruptcy; and, uh, the family had a difficult time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Did you, uh, feel that you were different in any way because you were Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="69">What was the, what did being Jewish mean to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Being Jewish, uh, meant going to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Being Jewish meant, uh, uh, studying for my bar mitzvah with, uh, an aging rabbi, with a long beard down to here, coming into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and sitting along side of him while we went over my Maftir and Haftora. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And, uh, being, uh, repelled by this old gentleman, because, uh, he had such terr...a terrible body odor about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I, I'd have to sit right along side of him; and we'd look at the same, uh, book, the same Hebrew book, and he would point out the phraseology to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And, uh, it was very difficult doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I also found it, uh, even then as an eleven-year-old or twelve-year-old, uh, almost silly, memorizing Hebrew words and not knowing what those words meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">In those days, when a young man was bar mitzvahed, uh, he read the words but, uh, there was very little meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Because you didn't understand what the interpretation of the words were. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Certainly you knew the Brocha [NB: blessings] and what they meant; and, uh, the Brocha for the wine and the Hamotzi and Shema, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And you knew what those meant, but to read a paragraph in Hebrew: I could read the paragraph; I didn't know what the words meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I was, uh, a Jewish kid growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> in a Jewish environment and a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Uh, as I said my, uh, my grandparents, uh, kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My parents did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Uh, I did not eat, uh, non-kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Uh (laughter), uh, the first time I had pork I was at <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">training table</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> my my freshman year--and my first meal, uh, my first lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I said, uh, "Would somebody please pass the lamb chops down to me?" (</span><span class="sentence" id="86">Laughter) And they weren't lamb chops. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And everyone started to laugh, because of course they were pork chops. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And they were delicious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Tell me about that first year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Uh, my first year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> after, uh, uh, my four great years in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .... I met my wife in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and that was, uh, a marvelous opportunity; and, uh, we're still married after, uh, 50 years, going on 50 right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Uh, we knew each other six years before we got married, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh, but the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> years, uh, were, uh, filled with success in terms of athletics. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I was always a fair student. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I never had trouble with my grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was, there was no problem in my being eligible to compete in sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">In those days eligibility was required. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You had to pass your subjects in order to play on the teams. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I had no problem doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> because a Jewish fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, the ADA chapter at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , uh, combined among its alumni to provide enough funds for me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My family certainly could not send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , because we didn't have the wherewithall, uh, didn't have anything close to the requirements to go to an <span class="BUILDING">away-college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Uh, but, uh, five Jewish men, uh, banded together to send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> so that, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> would have Jewish representation on its sports teams--on the track team and on the football team. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I was a well-known athlete, successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And, uh, John Bahsha, who had played football at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , a Jew, Irving Rosenfeld, uh, Mort Starobin, who was an All-American football player, uh, who was a fraternity brother.... They were all fraternity brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Walter Rose and, uh, Mitch Weill. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh, those five men, uh, would, uh, send the money to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> to pay for my tuition, and then I would work my way, uh, for, uh, my board. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I waited...I waited on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> at Sims (ph) Hall up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , and I used to brag that I was the fastest waiter in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because I was a track man and, uh, could serve very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And, uh, I spent my first six months living 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">wrestling room</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> , uh, and...uh, because there was no place for me to live at the <span class="BUILDING">fraternity house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh...incoming freshmen couldn't live at the <span class="BUILDING">fraternity house</span> according to the, uh, university rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So I lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">wrestling room</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> with, uh, a teammate and classmate named Al Handler--another Jewish boy who was sent up with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> by the same group of five. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And, uh, three of them--young men who became my very close friends through their lives--uh, Charlie Heer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Hope</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> ; and Bob Stewart from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , who couldn't spell a word; and, uh, a fellow named Bob Taylor who came out of <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And, uh, as both, uh, Stuie--Stewart-- and uh Charlie Heer told me, uh, I was the first Jew they ever met. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We had lots of fun in the <span class="INT_SPACE">wrestling room</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Sounds like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">When, uh, tell me about your getting involved in track that year at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Well, uh, I had a reputation as a track athlete from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and, uh, it was expected that I'd go out for the track team and, uh, so I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh, I ran the first indoor season after my freshman football season. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I played freshman football in the fall, which, uh, went right into the track season, <span class="DLF">indoor track</span> , and I used to practice on an <span class="DLF">outdoor board track</span> around the <span class="DLF">snow banks</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and, uh, uh, and I was easily the best sprinter in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We had a great quarter-miler at that time, a fellow named Eddie O'Brien, who was the national six-hundred yard champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He too made the Olympic team in 1936 as a quarter-miler. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And, uh, he and I were the two best runners in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I was a sprinter and he was a middle-distance runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And so I, uh, competed in the indoor track meets, uh, and I had some fair success. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I, uh, won medals in the Melrose Games and the New York AC Meet and the, uh, uh, IC four A's, uh, at the, uh, Knights of Columbus Meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Uh, I was invited down to run in the Sugar Bowl Track Meet, and, uh, I competed, uh, that freshman year, uh, successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  how did the Olympics come into the picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Well, after that, uh, uh, spring season of track and <span class="DLF">field</span> where I ran, uh, inter...intramural competition, and I couldn't compete for the varsity in those years because, uh, uh, freshmen were ineligible for inter-collegiate sports in those years--you had to be in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for your freshmen year and then compete, uh, in varsity sports starting in your sophomore year. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I, uh, uh, I ran on the freshman meets and I won all the meets and I, uh, uh, set track records at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> and at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> , where I ran in the indoor meet and, uh, various <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Uh, outdoors I began to win, uh, uh, more important races like the Metropolitan Senior Championships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , uh, where I beat a great black sprinter. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I beat Ben Johnson for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Ben John...not the same Ben Johnson of, uh, the 1988 Olympic games, but, uh, an earlier Ben Johnson who ran for Columbia. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And he was the world's fastest human indoors. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He set a world's record for, uh, sixty yards indoors. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I couldn't beat him at sixty, but I did beat him at a hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And after I beat him for the Senior Metropolitan Championships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I realized I had a chance to make the Olympic Team. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Because Ben was one of the best sprinters in the...in the world, and beating him, uh, made me think that I had a chance for the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And, uh, having, uh, won that race, I was invited to compete in the, uh, Regional Championships for the final Olympic Trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The Regional Trials took place up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , uh, and I won up there as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I beat Johnson again up there, along with, uh, oh, uh, uh, Billy Hopkins of Virginia‚Äô and, uh, uh, a fellow named, uh, Edgar Mason of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And, uh, I was the best sprinter in the Aast. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Jesse Owens won in the <span class="REGION">Middle West</span> , and, uh, Ralph Metcalfe won in the Far, uh, <span class="REGION">Middle West</span> , and, uh, Frank Wykoff won on the <span class="REGION">Pacific coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And by qualifying for the final in those regional meets, I qualified for the Olympic Final Trials at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall's Island</span> [<span class="BUILDING">Stadium</span> ], in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">When they were held, uh, uh, I, uh, finished third in one trial heat to qualify for the final. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And then, in the final, I ran ...(laughter), uh, in the final; we drew for <span class="DLF">lanes</span> --they hand out a pill or, uh, uh, round marbles which have numbers on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And you reach into a box and you pick out the the marble, and that's your lane number. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I had <span class="DLF">lane number five</span> ; and, uh, as I, with my little trowel, garden trowel, began to dig my <span class="DLF">starting hole</span> .... In those days, you didn't use starting blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">You used, you dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And I looked in <span class="DLF">lane number six</span> , and there was Ralph Metcalfe, the world's fastest human in '33 and '34 and '35. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And on my left, was Jesse Owens. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So here I was in <span class="DLF">lane number five</span> ; and <span class="DLF">lane number four</span> was Jesse and in <span class="DLF">lane number six</span> was Ralph, which was just as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And, uh, we raced, and, uh, uh, they won. (</span><span class="sentence" id="151">Laughter) I thought I finished third, but, uh, the judges thought otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, they gave me fifth, finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But in films of the race--and there was no photo finish in those years--uh, Bud Greenspan, the Olympic cinema photographer has films of that particular race. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And, uh, I clearly finished fourth, but they gave Foy Draper of <span class="REGION">Southern California</span> ‚Äô fourth, and me fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I thought I was in a dead heat with Frank Wykoff, who finished third. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Uh, as a matter of fact, right after the race, Ted Husing--the great broadcaster--uh, called all the sprinters over, introduced Jesse, interviewed him; interviewed Ralph, who finished second; and then introduced me, Marty Glickman, who finished third, the kid from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He said, "Oops, just a moment...uh, they're placing Frank Wykoff third. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And here's Frank.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And interviewed Frank.

<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  I made the team; and, uh, at the time there was talk of a boycott. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Uh, a boycott because of Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And the games were being held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The games were awarded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , mind you, not the German Republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But the games are awarded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and not to nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They were awarded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in 1931--before Hitler, a couple of years before Hitler came into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And there was talk about a boycott. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The boycott talk was not nearly as severe nor, as, uh, it resulted in 1988, in a complete boycott. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But, uh, there was talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And, uh, no one ever suggested to me that I don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Uh, no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Uh, I wanted to go for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I wanted to go because as an athlete, 1t was the goal of any young athlete, uh, American athlete, a Jewish-American athlete, to make the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">That was a goal that we all strove for. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Secondly, and I stress that 1t was second, uh, I wanted to show the world, the world that I knew, that a Jew could, uh, compete and do just as well as anyone else, and perhaps better. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And, uh, both Sam Stoller‚Äù and I made the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Sam finished sixth in that race. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I was judged to be fifth, and we both made the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We were the only two Jews on the Olympic track team. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Uh, there were two other Jews on the overall squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Sam Balter was on the basketball squad--a Jew from <span class="REGION">California</span> ; and, uh, Herman Goldberg--a Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> --uh, was on the baseball exhibition team. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And, uh, Herman and I became good friends while we were overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, uh, I wanted to make the team for those two reasons: first, because I was selfish as an athlete and I wanted to succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I wanted to win. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And secondly, because as a Jew I wanted to show that, uh, Jews were just as good as anyone else and perhaps better.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Tell me about that training. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Tell me about your teammates first. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Who were they and what were they like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  Well, as a sprinter, naturally I trained with the sprinters. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And they were, uh, Jesse Owens, who was a marvelous man. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Uh, one of the smoothest athletes in...in function I've ever seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Uh, perhaps the smoothest. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Ralph Metcalfe, who was an experienced track athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He won silver medals in 1932--should have won gold, but he made some mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And, uh, the officials made some mistakes with Ralph, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They had him run in a two hundred-meter, uh, race. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And his <span class="DLF">lane</span> around a turn was eight feet longer than the other runners in that race, so he finished, uh, third. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">As he came off the turn and down the straight-away, he was shocked to find himself as far back as he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Uh, again, films prove that he was given an incorrect <span class="DLF">starting line</span> , but that sometimes happens with, uh, some of the track officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So we we trained together: Owens, Metcalfe, uh, Frank Wykoff--who'd been on three, uh, two previous Olympic teams. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He'd been on the relay teams in 1928 and in 1932, had retired, and then, uh, came back to make the 1936 Olympic team. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">There was Foy Draper, uh, a student of <span class="REGION">Southern California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">There was Sam Stoller, a student at, uh, <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> ; and there was Mack Robinson--a great two hundred-meter runner, uh, not nearly as good in the one hundred-meter run. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">At a hundred meters, he finished seventh in that final Olympic trial; and he finished second to Jesse in the two hundred-meter Olympic final. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He won the Silver medal. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Mack Robinson is Jackie Robinson's older brother, and not nearly as well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Uh, he didn't play baseball except as, uh...a, uh...a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Was a good football player, uh, Mack was. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But he was completely overshadowed by his brother, Jackie, in later years. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">But those were the seven track men. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Uh, and we spent a good deal of time together; practicing together, living near each other in...1n the same, uh, Olympic, uh, uh, <span class="BUILDING">building</span> --a one-story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with perhaps twenty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And, uh, uh, each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had, uh, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> ; and I roomed with my Syracuse teammate, Eddie O'Brien‚Äô, a four hundred-meter runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">He was on the four...uh, sixteen hundred relay--the four-by-four hundred-meter relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I was on the four-by-one hundred-meter relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And because we were team mates at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , we roomed together in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Uh, Eddie died a number of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Uh, Sam Stoller and I were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We knew we were, uh, fellow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We made nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Uh, you know, we were just two of the guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Uh, he was not, um, closer to me than, uh, Foy Draper was, or Eddie O'Brien was, or Frank Wykoff was. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">He was just one of the boys, and I was one of the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Uh, I was younger than most of the guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I...I guess I was...I was the second youngest man on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I was eighteen; and a hop, step and jumper from <span class="BUILDING">LSU</span> named Bobby Brown¬Æ was the youngest young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He was seventeen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Uh, and Sam was a couple of years older than I--Sam Stoller, a couple of years older than I.

and Foy Draper was third. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Three days after that, uh, a special meeting was called in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic Village</span> amongst the seven sprinters. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The head track coach, Lawson Robertson of <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , and the assistant head track coach, Dean Cromwell of <span class="REGION">Southern California</span> ; and in that meeting, the morning of the day we were supposed to run, Sam and I were told, with the others present, that we were going to be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And the reason we were being replaced was that the Germans were hiding their best sprinters and saving them to upset the American team in the four hundred-meter relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Uh, when I heard that, being a brash eighteen year old, I said, "Hey, Coach, it's not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">In order to be a world class sprinter, you must run in world-class competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You can't hide world-class sprinters.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Nevertheless, said the two coaches, "there is a strong rumor to that effect and so Jesse and Ralph are going to replace you and Sam.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There was no question that Jesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe were faster than Sam and I, by a <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Unquestionably. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But we had practiced passing the baton for the two weeks we were in Europe, uh, during the course of the games, the four hundred-meter relay coming near, near the end of the track competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We'd practiced passing the baton amongst, uh, uh, Foy Draper, uh, Frank Wykoff, Sam Stoller and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And, uh, Jesse and Ralph had not even touched the baton until they ran that afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Jesse said in that meeting, "Coach, I've won my three gold medals: the hundred, the two hundred and the long jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I've had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I'm tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Let Marty and Sam run. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They deserve it.‚Äù‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And Dean Cromwell, the <span class="REGION">Southern California</span> coach, pointed his finger at him and said, "You'll do as you're told!" </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And in those days, Black athletes did as they were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So did all athletes, for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So Jesse volunteered not to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I'd always loved the man and respected him throughout my complete association with him;

<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Uh, mostly because of antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The Blacks were winning everything, or virtually everything--uh, the one hundred, the two hundred, the four hundred, the eight hundred, the high jump and the long jump were won by Black athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And it was terribly embarrassing for the Nazi hierarchy who gathered every day in the <span class="BUILDING">Olympic stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Hitler flanked by Goring and Goebbels and Himmler and Streicher, and the rest of that horrible entourage, uh, were there every day watching the events. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And after Blacks would win, they'd get up and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Uh, they'd see the competition, but then they would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And, uh, it's my belief that Avery Brundage, who was chief of the American Olympic, uh, Team,‚Äô uh, didn't want to further embarrass the Nazis in that myth of Nazi Aryan supremacy by having Jews stand on the winning podium before a hundred and twenty thousand cheering people--Germans mostly--and the world's press and the world's radio coverage of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">There's no question we would have won. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Uh, the only way we could have lost is to have dropped the baton during the race--always a possibility, but the likelihood of that happening is really remote because we were experienced runners. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And, uh, we practiced assiduously, and, uh, would have won the race handily. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It developed later on that I ran in a four hundred yard relay with Wykoff, Owens, Metcalfe, myself, uh, in, uh, a meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at <span class="BUILDING">White City Stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We set a world's record for four hundred yards, a record which still stands. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Uh, not many people run four hundred yard relays anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But, uh, we didn't run on the, uh, on the American team. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We should have, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  When you talk about the coaches, you had mentioned another reason when we were...
ANSWER:  Uh, Dean Cromwell was the head coach of the [University of] Southern California Olympic, uh, track team and the assistant head coach of the Olympic team. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">He wanted to make sure that his runners competed. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">He wanted to make sure that, uh, Wykoff ran not only in the one hundred-meter dash, in which he placed fourth, but Foy Draper was to run on the relay as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Uh, Draper, who was beaten by, uh, Sam and me just a couple of days previous. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The...the...the four of us should have run together--uh, Draper and Wykoff and Stoller and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">That's the way we practiced passing the baton for the several weeks we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic Village</span> , practicing for the relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We'd have won the race handily. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">That's the way the relay should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Uh, Mack Robinson was competing in the two hundred-meter run; and the two hundred and the four hundred-meter relay came at approximately...on approximately the same days or series of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So that Mack would be quite busy running in the two hundred meter-relay trials, uh, uh, quarter finals, semi-finals and finals--in which he finished second. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And Jesse also was quite busy during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Jesse did not want to run that four hundred-meter relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And he volunteered, as I said, not to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He was tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">After the Olympic games were ended, he came straight <span class="BUILDING">home</span> --with the exception of that one track meet in in, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in which I told you he ran the relay on which I also competed. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And, uh, he just wanted to get back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He was tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He was beat, 'cause he had been, you know, running virtually every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But as I said, he was told to run and so he ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">The coach of, uh, <span class="REGION">Southern California</span> was Dean Cromwell; and he ‚Äô Brundage was President of the American Olympic Committee and of the Amateur Athletic Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">was, uh, uh, an officious person, who later became an "America First," uh, had no Blacks on his track team. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It's remarkable [that] even in those years, when Blacks were so dominant in track and field and <span class="REGION">Southern California</span> --<span class="BUILDING">USC</span> --had the best college track team in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , there was not one Black athlete on the USC track team. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">All white. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Uh, Dean Cromwell apparently was a bigot. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Being an "American First," he would have to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Uh, Lawson Robertson, the head coach, was an older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Uh, had a severe limp, walked with a cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Uh, I think he was dominated by Cromwell. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">He was still his own man. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">He was the head coach of the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , but he was an older person. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">He might have been in his sixties at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I don't know exactly how old he he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The day following the trial heats, when the Germans qualified but were well out of contention, walking across the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> on the, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic Village</span> I heard a voice calling to me, and I turned. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It was Lawson Robertson, the head coach, perhaps, uh, fifty, sixty yards away, uh, waving to me; and I jogged over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Uh, I didn't wait for him to limp over to me with his cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And he said, "Marty," he said, "I want to apologize to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I made a terrible mistake.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And he apologized. "</span><span class="sentence" id="424">You should have run on the relay.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And so he apologized. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Dean Cromwell never said a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Avery Brundage never said a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Whereas my firm belief that, uh, Cromwell's desire to have his men on the team--which could have been met anyhow--and the antisemitism I engendered by, uh, uh, people on the Olympic Team, led by Avery Brundage, uh, prevented the two Jews from standing on that winning podium in front of a huge crowd and, uh, being acclaimed as the best four hundred-meter relay runners in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">That was the reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  What about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brundage</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="431">What did you know of Brundage, if anything, at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Brundage didn't speak to athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Uh, Brundage, uh, uh.... As you probably saw, motion pictures and still shots of Brundage smiling happily in the company of Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goring and people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Uh, he was, uh, uh, a stern, big... uh, uh, uh, obnoxious is what I'm looking to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">But, uh, in addition to that, uh, he was a truculent gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Uh, a dictatorial kind of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Ultimately, he became, uh, president of the International Olympic Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">At that time, he was president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Uh, I never talked to him; as I say, he didn't talk to athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I never accosted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Uh, perhaps I was, uh, fearful of accosting him. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Uh, he was, uh, an officious, stern, uh, ageressive individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And, uh, he liked to be seen in the company of all the powers that be. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">It was he also who decried...decreed that Eleonor Holm be thrown off the team because she drank champagne on the, uh, uh, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> going over. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And, uh, his word was law. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I've seen him upon occasion literally brush aside people who would walk up to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">If he were walking across the <span class="DLF">infield</span> of a...of a <span class="DLF">track</span> , and a newspaper man--and I saw this myself--uh, wanted to talk to him, he'd literally shoulder him aside as he walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And kept right on walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Uh, he was very difficult...a difficult person to be with. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">At least, as far as the * The America First Committee, of which Avery Brundage was to be a founder, was an isolationist movement which served as an umbrella for anti-British, anti-French, pro-German and antisemitic groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">athletes were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Uh, but as I say, I never talked to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  What did you do after that defeat? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Where did you go from here, after that not being allowed to run? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  After, uh, the relay... There was the...the trial heats, which we won handily; and, uh the final, which we also won handily--as I say, between twelve and fifteen yards out in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Uh, uh, almost anyone could have run on our relay team, and we would have won. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Uh, I was angered, uh, and determined that come 1940--four years hence from the '36 games--uh, I'd be back and win it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I'd win the hundred, then two hundred and, uh, run on the relay team as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But 1940 never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The war broke out in 1939, and so there was no opportunity to, uh, show what I could do, uh, in the Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And the games didn't resume, of course, until 1948; and that was long after I was...had stopped competing. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">However, I was fortunate in that, uh, I had other interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Uh, football in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">The Games wound up in August; and we toured Europe for a short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And I ran in...1n <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on that four hundred-yard relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I ran in, uh, in, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , and, uh, I ran in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Uh, I ran, uh, a number of <span class="NPIP">places</span> ; and, uh, then came right back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and went right up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> to play football for <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And my interest, uh, was, uh, inundated by, uh, the practice workouts and starting of classes at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And, uh, the Olympic games didn't fade away from me, by any matter; uh, but it, uh... uh, the other interests I had sublimated to a great extent, uh, what took place in the the summer of 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And, of course, I had 1940 to look forward to as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I did well as a football player at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I became a...a broadcaster as a result of, uh, my football playing experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Uh, in my junior year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , I had a particularly good day against Cornell. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We were unbeaten, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We were 2 and 0; and Cornell had beaten <span class="BUILDING">Penn State</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colgate</span> and...uh, <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Uh, either <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> or <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They were 3 and 0. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They were a national power in those days, Cornell was. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We played at <span class="DLF">Shoelkopf Field</span> at, uh, uh, <span class="BUILDING">Cornell</span> , at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ithaca</span> ; and, uh, we beat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Upset them 14 to 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I scored both touchdowns. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I ran a punt back for one touchdown. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I bucked over for another. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I intercepted two passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I, uh, made a couple of, uh, touchdown-saving tackles. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Best day I ever had by far on the <span class="DLF">football field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And the following day, because of the publicity upstate...uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Upstate New York</span> , and throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as well, uh, I received a phone call from a local haberdasher who introduced himself to me on the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He said, "Marty, frankly, I want to cash in on your publicity. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I want you [to] do to a radio broadcast for me.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I said, "You don't want me. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I'm nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I stutter. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I stammer. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I've never been on the <span class="DLF">air</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He said, "I'll pay you $15.00 a broadcast.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So I stopped stuttering and I went on the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And (laughter) that's how I started my broadcast career; and I continue that since that time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I was pretty bad, but, uh, I worked at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  What did you do during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  During the war I was, uh, a Marine Corps lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I served in the <span class="REGION">Marshall Islands</span> , uh, on <span class="NPIP">places</span> like, uh, Kwajalein and Eniwetok, Majuro and Enjebi and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I was a night fighter controller. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I was a lieutenant in the Marine Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And, uh, the Olympic situation was far, far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I might tell you a story about, uh, uh, the war, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I...[ mentioned running in a track meet in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It was a triangular meet among, uh, Japanese athletes, French athletes, and American athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And, uh, we went to the <span class="DLF">starting line</span> to dig our <span class="DLF">starting holes</span> again with this trowel, and on my left was a fellow from <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> named Suzuki. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I recognized him, because he had run in the one hundred-meter races. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">He was, uh, beaten in the semi-finals, didn't qualify for the final. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And, uh, as we dug our <span class="DLF">starting holes</span> , we glanced at each other and smiled at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I noticed his warm, lustrous brown eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And, uh, then we, uh, finished preparing for the race. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We shook hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I shook hands with the Frenchman along side. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Frank Wykoff was the other American on the race. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I got off to a real good start, and I won the race. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Uh, Wykoff was second and Suzuki finished third. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I jogged back to the <span class="DLF">starting line</span> ; and felt a tap on my shoulder as I jogged back for my warm-up clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And I turned, and I saw Suzuki. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And his arm was outstretched and we shook hands, and again I noticed these warm brown lustrous eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And he was my friend, I was his friend, and, uh, uh, we had just competed against each other for these ten, ten and a half seconds at a hundred meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We couldn't speak each other's language. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">In the opening days of World War II, when the Japanese were landing on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luzon</span> , I read that a Japanese Olympic athlete, Lieutenant Suzuki, had been killed in those landings. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And I, an American Marine, cried for this Japanese soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I actually bawled. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And, uh, it's just an indication of what the Olympic games and international athletics can do for an individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I learned, uh, uh, that the other athletes from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> --and, uh, the athletes from all over the world--were just like me, and I was just like them. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We were the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We had the same interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We had the same love of sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Uh, we had the same respect for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And it was a wonderful experience, having been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Tell me about an incident that you described earlier in the New York Athletic Club. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And when that took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  When I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , uh, I played as...uh, a season of football at Syracuse my sophomore year. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And, uh, towards the end of the season, uh, when I began training for track, I was invited to race in the Sugar Bowl Track Meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">At that time, the Sugar Bowl had other activities besides the, uh, football game itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And they had the track meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I was invited down to the Sugar Bowl; and I trained on the <span class="DLF">boardwalk</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coney Island</span> in mid- winter, in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And it was just too rough to train there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And I encountered a friend of mine, who ran for the New York AC--a fellow named Eddie O'Sullivan--uh, a sprinter. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And, uh, I told him about my difficulty in working out; and he says, "Why don't you join me down at the AC, and practice with me on the <span class="DLF">indoor track</span> there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I said, 'That would be great, Eddie! </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I'll join you on such and such a day.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And so on that day, I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> with my little satchel and I walked into the New York AC. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I was walking across the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> to go to where the <span class="DLF">indoor track</span> was, on one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">upper floors</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Athletic Club</span> ; and, uh, I was stopped by Paul Pilgrim, the director of athletics at the New York AC. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">He knew me, and I knew him. "</span><span class="sentence" id="551">Uh, what are you doing here, Marty?" </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I said, "Well, I've come down to work out with, uh...with Eddie O'Sullivan. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He's asked me to workout with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I'm training for the Sugar Bowl Track Meet.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And, uh, Paul Pilgrim, this mature adult, uh, said, uh, "I'm afraid you can't, Marty.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I said, "Well...well, why not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He said, "Well, there's no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> upstairs.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I said, "But I've just got my little satchel, and I'Il...I'll share Eddie's locker.‚Äù "</span><span class="sentence" id="559">I'm afraid you can't go up there, Marty. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You can't work out here.‚Äù "</span><span class="sentence" id="561">Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Uh, okay, Mr. Pilgrim.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And I turned and I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And it was then I realized that because I was Jewish I could not work out at the New York Athletic Club. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And that was perhaps the second overt sign of antisemitism that I...I felt; the first, of course, being in the Olympic Games itself, and, uh, not being allowed to run there and not being allowed to work out, mind you, at the New York AC. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I've, uh, been unhappy with the New York AC ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Oh, I...I...J ran in the Sugar Bowl Track Meet, and I, I won down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So, uh, it didn't make that much difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  I'd like to know a little bit more about your teammates, particularly about Jesse Owens. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">You maintained a friendship with him, I understand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Uh, early on, in 1936, uh, Jesse was, uh, almost, uh, an icon, uh, of athletics. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And I looked up to him, uh, as any young man might. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Uh, after we were together on the team, uh, we were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We became fairly close. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Uh, I visited him at his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Uh, I saw him at various sports functions through the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">He and I became good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Uh, we did several broadcasts together; uh, particularly on Home Box Office, where I was, uh, the sports director, and I had Jesse come in and do some programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Particularly the, uh, uh, Bud Greenspan Olympiad series, where Jesse was host--except for one program that I hosted, in which Jesse was the star of the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And it wouldn't do to have Jesse introduce himself, so, uh, he and I talked on this program. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And, uh...but we saw each other regularly and frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Our wives knew each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Uh, I had lunch with Jesse at his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> with Ruth, his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">When Jesse died in 1980, uh, I was the only white teammate of Jesse's at his funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Which shocked the Hell out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I mean, there were many many white athletes on the team; but the only athlete, white athlete, who showed up for his funeral was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">All the Black athletes were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Uh, but, uh, I was the only white athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And, uh, I was, uh, shocked and I was pleased that I was there; but also, uh, astounded by the lack of other individuals not being there at his funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Uh, I worked for five years with the Jesse Owens Foundation, from '80 through '85. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for the first time in '85, to the <span class="BUILDING">Olympic Stadium</span> , uh, to help prepare for the celebration of Jesse Owen's golden anniversary of his winning those four gold medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Uh, he had died in 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I went back in '85 along with, uh, uh, two men--Jim McDonald and Herb Douglas--also of the Foundation, to help prepare for the anniversary celebration at a track meet to be held in 1986--fifty years after, uh, Jesse won in the same <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The <span class="BUILDING">Olympic stadium</span> still stands. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And, uh, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> with my two colleagues; and, uh, excused myself to walk down into the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> proper and walk on the <span class="DLF">track</span> to that <span class="REGION">area</span> which...uh, where I was... where I should have run and didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I walked along that stretch of a hundred meters or so, and I stopped and looked across at the <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> , and saw where Hitler and Goring and Goebbels and Streicher and Himmler and Hess and all those people sat. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And right along side of that was where I sat, where the athletes sat who were not competing; and our <span class="REGION">section</span> was along side of where Hitler's private box was. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And suddenly, a wave of anger swept over me so that I thought I was going to pass out. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I began to cuss and fume, used every dirty word I know, out loud. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Uh, to the effect that how could those dirty bastards do this to any eighteen year-old kid, or any athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Keep them from competing in the Olympic Games. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And after three or four or five minutes--however long it was--I finally calmed down and realized that I'd kept all that anger bottled up for forty-nine years. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I hadn't been back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in all that time, and certainly not back to the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And, uh, I felt purged for the first time of that anger, which, uh, gnawed at me probably all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And, uh, the track meet was held the following year, and celebrating Jesse's fiftieth anniversary of the four gold medals he had won.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Thank you very much. </span>
