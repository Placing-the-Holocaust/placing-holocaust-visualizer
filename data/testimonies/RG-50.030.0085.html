<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  ...the German part of it was just about over and we thought everything was through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Then we felt the more serious part was with the uh Japanese carrying on and and continuing to kill our people in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , and so they said you have more work to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Many of us were hoping that we would be ready to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We weren't ready to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">So I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and I was sent there and all I can say is that it was the most meaningful experience because I never believed I may as well move right into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> - I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , not thinking there were any Jews at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">What would Jews be doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ?. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I announced to my men that we're going to celebrate at least the service of victory, we were going to celebrate the first service of freedom, and we had just...
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I need to back up for one minute, because I need people to understand a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Uh, can you tell us - you came with a group of men and this would be ...
ANSWER:  This group that we, I was part of The Flying Tigers. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The Flying Tigers were that part of the Air Force which dedicated itself to General Chenault (ph) to help him in winning the war in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I was part of the Flying Tigers. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And when I, and after the war I did, I was invited to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peking</span> where at the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> I was given a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> for the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Three of us were chosen as the symbols to show that this, that we had won this war, and I was given with them, with the with the navigator who knocked down forty-eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> or something, uh uh I mean a pilot, a bombardier, whatever it was, three of us were given the Chinese Medal of Honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I value that because I found out that nobody else every got the Chinese Medal of Honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But that was for being in an American serving in the Flying Tigers and in the 14th Air Force and doing my work in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  How did you get to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Really by orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They they wanted a chaplain and they wanted a Jewish chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">They look around and they see where there is no Jewish chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They wanted me to come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So I came to be the chaplain and I announced immediately after I got there when when we had won the war, I felt that we should celebrate the winning of the war, and we took a very big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> - I think I have a picture of it - and we got the various groups together and I sent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> to pick up my men and a lot of non-Jews wanted to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Everybody wanted to come to celebrate the victory. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So I took the largest <span class="NPIP">place</span> I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I knew this would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And I come to into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and I see youngsters there and they look little Nazis - blond hair, blue eyes, and they talked with heavy German accents. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I couldn't believe what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">What were they doing here?. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Why would German kids come to my service?. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I finally found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">These kids were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they came with other men and women - walked eight miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They had no way of getting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">How they got there I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">How they knew that we were having this service I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But there they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">A whole group and my men are standing around - they hardly had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They were standing all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We start the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Children whom we didn't know, looked like little Nazis, spoke with heavy German accents, little English... (ph) and my men standing around - what did I do to them?. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And as I said now we shall turn and sing "Shma. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Israel.". "</span><span class="sentence" id="41">Hear oh <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the Lord our God, the Lord....". </span><span class="sentence" id="42">As I turned to Shma Israel, the kids looked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Hey, these are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The soldiers looked down and saw the kids singing Shma Israel, so with Shma Israel, "Hear oh God the Lord our God, the Lord is one," the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> became one and the soldiers start pointing to the men and the soldiers melted into the crowd and suddenly I saw kids on soldiers' laps. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The whole thing became one magnificent beautiful service of victory. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And when it was over I turned to to to the, who are you?. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So they invited me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So I have a picture here of me the next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I'm in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I found out that these children attend <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So then I went, after conducting a sabbath service, which was very unusual - they would never have taken a non- orthodox rabbi to conduct - they didn't even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They just know I was a chaplain so they didn't bother uh you know - today's world you wouldn't have an orthodox, a conservative rabbi conducting uh an orthodox uh sabbath morning service. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">This is what I did and they were so pleased and that Bar Mitzvah boy was so wonderful, and and the family ...
QUESTION:  Back-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">What Bar Mitzvah boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  A kid from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">A youngster who was turning thirteen and it it was just a delight because a Saturday morning what does he have to do for bar mitzvah - not the speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He gives a portion of the Talmud - he gives a portion where he asks an impossible question, and I myself said to myself, what is the answer to that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Then he answers it on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And while he's answering, he's thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He's going na-na-na, and then he gets stuck because he's a little stuck in his own thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">As he gets stuck, the whole congregation sings ya-ba- bam, ya-ba-bam, ya-ba-bam. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Then he raises his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He's got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They stop on a dime. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He continues na-da-da. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Whenever he gets stuck they sing and then they, he carried through with this dissertation of one hour on an impossible subject with an impossible question at the age of thirteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was visibly impressed that this 1s the way they celebrate a Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They invited me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And I went to the juniors and seniors in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> because they already had learned English. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They were studying English. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I decided to have them write a composition and the composition is "<span class="BUILDING">Home</span> Is Where Your Heart Is.". </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I said where is your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Where is your heart now that you've come from all over the world?. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And how thrilling 1t was to have youngsters who had never heard of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but now they say we don't want to go back any <span class="NPIP">place</span> , any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We want to go <span class="NPIP">place</span> to a <span class="REGION">land</span> that we can call our own and the only land 1n the world that we would trust today would be <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So the 90%, then 10% of course said they'd like to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , so they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But I have used some of their original, their letters to quote from them to show of this universal love that they had to go to a homeland, to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Now here we are in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , and I don't know how - what you want to continue in here, but I have...
QUESTION:  Let let me let ask you if I could a couple of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Can you describe for me uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> as you found it?. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">You have given me two incidents but after the service and after the bar mitzvah, uh you learned about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Tell me what you learned?. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">What what how was it structured?. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">What had people done?. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Well, the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> which I came into and this was already uh this was right after the war, the Joint Distribution Committee and uh of of the Jewish people heard about their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai ghetto</span> ...well first of all, how did we become a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">How did it become a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The Japanese became very friendly with Nazis, and they didn't want to be outdone when they heard what Hitler was doing to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The Jews were living very peacefully in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But as they came and conquered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> they decided that they must follow and imitate uh the Nazi empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Otherwise they wouldn't be uh good allies, so they immediately started to introduce some of the customs that were prevalent in Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They immediately said, here, you Jews have to be within the scope of this.__. _</span><span class="sentence" id="93">.(PH) settlement so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">This is where you have to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You have certain hours you can't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">This is where you will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Your <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> will be here, and they made a complete and they actually had uh II don't know, I remember some of the kids saying they had badges which after the war they ripped off, and had all kinds of symbols to remind them that they are Jews, that they are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That they are different from all other people and this was the stigmata that that the Japanese carried over merely to ape uh Hitler's concept of what should be, this image of the Jew to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And this is what they tried to imitate in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But the the Joint Distribution Committee came in immediately with food and with equipment and I was amongst the first that was standing there and I have a picture with me with little children where we're giving them food baskets and and trying to show them that there are other people out there who care for them, who want to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And this is where I met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And then I have stories of their schooling, and ...
QUESTION:  Tell me some of those that as you know them, as your experiences were in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Well, they had two types of schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">There was a man there by the name of Saul Livery (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Does the name ring a bell?. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Saul Livery was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He was the spirit of Judaism in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He decided that even though we're in these dismal surroundings, there's one thing that we need to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We have to know our heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We have to know our history. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We have to know our literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And so Saul Livery was the spirit that motivated and energized not just the Yeshiva learning, but that the Jews should know literature and history even on a Hebraic (ph) secular level. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Hebrew literature, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He wanted to teach them Hebrew so he formed a series of religious schooling which was the saving grace of these young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Then they had to have their secular schooling so there were there were two great <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> - one was the Kaduri (ph) School and the other was another <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which I, slips my mind but I have it in my notes, and in these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> the children went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> to learn their secular subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">When I came in to the little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , I found out that they had nothing to write on. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The kids would pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of black slate that writes and these were their notebooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I thought I must do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So I sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they sent me books and and paper and notebooks and pencils and so on - the greatest gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Imagine children considering it the greatest gift I could give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">When I came one day to their to their little <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and I handed out notebooks with pencils, with pens, with books, with with all the equipment that they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They said I revolutionized the the school system in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because we gave them pens and pencils. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">When I think of what a gift means to somebody - they they they kissed my hands, the kids, for for the fact that I brought them this. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The same as after that first service. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">At at the end of that first service I'm standing at the <span class="DLF">door</span> trying to see who these people are as they leave to say goodbye, and they started kissing my chaplain's insignia which I have there. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The Jewish, because I had a Jewish star on it - they say you brought freedom, freedom to us and these, the whole the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> felt that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> saved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That we brought freedom to the people from the Nazi empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was a very thrilling moment in in American history when we were considered the proponents of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It's being recapitulated right now in every country of <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> that that that when you .. OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Any other questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Tell me some more about other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the vic...uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that you visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Tell me about <span class="BUILDING">people's homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">What were they like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that I visited, and I'll give you an example of this bar mitzvah - I went into a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They must have had about five or six in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They they they went from hand to mouth as far as food is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Uh some standing on <span class="DLF">food lines</span> and some uh trying to eke out a living from each other, just like in 1n the ancient in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of of of former times, of of three, four hundred years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">What I found most exciting was the fact that the the Judaism which to many of them had never meant anything, I found that the the Jews of the survivors went one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I thought that most of them would turn against their faith and I thought that as I went in one <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after another these were survivors and these were the children and these were children without any parents who they adopted as their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">As I went into these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> I felt why would they want to carry on this heritage where there they were told - by the way some of them are so assimilated, so far-removed from anything Jewish - they looked so German that they could be an example of blonde hair, blue eyes, clipped - an example of German aristocracy, and went into their pitiful <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and saw their lovely children, saw that these children weren't even their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They were adopting orphans who - by the way that's quite a story that these orphans were brought half way around the world and I found out later, you remember there's a story about Hannah Szenes [NB: Sennesh] who who who said I'm a match that was not to be consumed, where she volunteered to help save - I found out that Haganah, that the Jewish underground, had formed a <span class="DLF">railway</span> and taken youngsters and put them into <span class="BUILDING">Christian homes</span> who put their lives on the stake to save Jewish kids where the kids would be hidden in these <span class="BUILDING">Christian homes</span> by day, and in the evening, at sunset they would pick them up and ride them through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and ride them to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where they had another <span class="BUILDING">Christian home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I didn't know that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And here I find that these kids were telling about the Israelis who who from from Haganah, went out there to save these kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">This was a chapter that that that really was hair-raising to me, to find these kids saved from in that kind of situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">As far as the - let me give you this bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Here's a lovely little kid, little boy who would have known nothing if it weren't for the fact that a fellow like Saul Livery so to it that there was Jewish education. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And took the few that knew Jewish education and made <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">By the way, not only <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> - they created a choir, a choir of forty voices that came and sang at my first service. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They had uh men with such beautiful voices - they called them cantors. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They had operatic voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I had an operatic singer conducting my Friday night service. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">With such a voice I wish I had video and I wish I had sound recording to hear that voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">To me it was, an operatic tenor like like Jan Peerce or Richard Tucker the days of...so here was my service where these people walked in and and and they - forty voice choir. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">An operatic singer to help me conduct a service, so at the beginning it was very cold because they did their Germanic music and I didn't get in to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It wasn't until they let me take over with an opening hymn "Shma Israel" that the whole group got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">That that's an aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But the beauty of that experience is that I see this youngster who could easily - first of all, how he survived - he was an orphan - how he survived the Nazi massacre and ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> in itself is is beyond understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Since he was only thirteen he wasn't one of those that wrote my compositions, so I started to talk with him and its another one of those stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">He he saw his - the knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> - he he saw them take his father and his mother and his sister and he were left and then and then two days later his sister was taken because she was a beautiful girl, and this kid saw it at four, five, six years old and he's telling this story and now he's going to be bar mitzvahed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">His mother disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So this is the kind of story that I got in in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and when you get it directly, when you hear it from a kid's lips, it's different than than the whole six million story again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It's just different. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">A bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">This kid to have such a Jewish bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">When they had to celebrate after the service, I, they said come and join us in a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They had one bottle of schnapps, of liquor, which they had kept for the whole year and every time they take a few they fill 1t with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They filled the bottle with water so it says liquor. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I said I don't drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They says this you can drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I said I don't drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They said this you can drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Take a look. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I'm drinking water. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But they have a big bottle of Jewish liquor, uh liquor, and they, everybody drinks it as if LALHAIM (ph) and they make believe they're they're getting drunk on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">It's the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They have five bottles like that, practically all water, but this was their their schnapps. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">This was their SABBATH THING and a little old piece of herring which was this big -
