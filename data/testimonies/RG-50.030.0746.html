QUESTION:  So could you tell me a little bit about your life, your â€” your early -- the earliest you can remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> , which is very much in the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My father worked for the <span class="BUILDING">Henschel Company</span> , so that's pretty much the most important <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">The Henschel were famous for making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> , and later on, they made the famous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Henschel airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">That's where I was, and my mother disliked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">That's where the Lindenhessen (ph) lived there, very, very unpleasant people, mostly Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was the only Catholic, so they called me the Katholische Rattenschwanz.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Catholic rattail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Catholic rattail, and so then my father eventually secured a job as director of Feindliche Industrial Refrigeration Company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , and so we moved there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  How old were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  When I was 11, maybe 12, and of course there was a change then, a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , different environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I joined the swimming club and became part of the Jungvolk, which 1s the early stage of the Hitler Youth, divided in Jungvolk, Hitler Youth and then of course the armed forces, and at 14, I joined -- or better said, I had to join the Hitler Youth, which was an organization from 14 to 18 and it was very much a premilitary preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Did you like the Hitler Youth, I mean what kind of activities did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Oh, it was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We liked it very much because we had, I -- oh, let me explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The Hitler Youth was divided like the armed forces into Navy, Army and so on, Air Force, and as a swimmer, I joined the Navy and was trained to become an underwater demolition expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So what we learned there was rather interesting, spent a lot of time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Didn't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> because services were generally on Sunday mornings purposely, traveled a lot to compete in other cities of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , camaraderie, nice friends, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And Nazis as such or the philosophy of national socialism didn't enter our brain very much; we were a little too young to understand all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We saw more or less the victorious aspect of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that means coming up with something new in the industry and designing a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> and being number one in this and so on, and eventually of course came the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So the answer to your question was I liked it very much, yes, it was very enjoyable. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was like -- like in a way like somebody joining the Boy Scouts here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Well, what was the week like? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So how often would you go to the Hitler Youth, what would you do in the Hitler Youth --

QUESTION:  What was your sport, what was your event?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Iswam 100-meter breast stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">At that time, shortly after I started, breast stroke was divided 100 strokes to swim butterfly and breast stroke, and butterfly didn't have a dolphin kick but it had a breast stroke kick, so there has been a quite an evolution in swimming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  And you were successful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  You were a successful swimmer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was quite successful, yes, and then later on I became the goalie because the goalie of the German water polo team had a fatal accident so they were looking for one, and during a little training period, I played goalie and I was pretty good, so they asked me to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So I became the goalie of the water polo team, and that was more fun than anything, except we played a lot in -- <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and sometimes the water was about 14, 16, ice cold, ice cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So, yeah, but it was enjoyable because it was a camaraderie and...
QUESTION:  Did you have classes in Nazi, you know --
ANSWER:  We had classes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We had classes and learned many things theoretically, others in practice, like the language of the flags and some Morse alphabet, et cetera, et cetera, those. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Learned about Bruttoregistertonnen, what all that meant, the size of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The armed forces or the Hitler Youth equal to the armed forces was also divided into ranks, like the GI and the corporal and the -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So many of the guys I didn't like became lieutenants and captains and I had to salute them, and I didn't like that idea very much because I had absolutely no respect for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I thought they were a bunch of sissies. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So that brought upon the first resentment, the first problems and that --
QUESTION:  How about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Do you think a lot of the boys believed -- believed what they were being told?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Did you believe what were you being told?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Something I didn't believe, I questioned it, because I had such a good experience with the freundlich and the frohliche and the families with whom I had a very nice contact, they were nice to me, so I said why, and I mean we had Jewish neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So of course while this was going on, on the other hand, we got indoctrination in every way possible, newspapers, Sturmer, education, the teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I mean we were fed entire Judaism from left and right, and I assume that some -- some -- some youngsters probably asked themselves whether there was not something true about those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My question was once when the persecution started, I helped once as an altar boy, and I didn't like the chaplain very much because he's always late, I had to wake him up, but one day I asked him, I said, why is there so much hatred? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I mean Jesus was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It's there written on the cross, INRI, Jesus von Nazareth, Konig der Juden. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Walter, you're not allowed to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You have to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So I felt that was rather stupid as anything I ever heard and -- but I didn't say anything, but I was dumbfounded, let's put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And my father was extremely critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My father was in World War I from the first day till the last day. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He was in every major battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He was wounded three times and he was very much anti Hitler, and he heard -- listened to the NBC or CBS, NBC, CBS -- CBS, and my uncle told him, be careful, they're going to catch you one of these days, you'll end up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  So BBC, yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  BBC?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  BBC.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  British Broadcasting Corporation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  British, British, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And so what this little Hitler, what he expects going to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I mean he's going to bleed to death and all these poor young boys will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So that was kind of my father's spiel, but he very soon, thanks to his knowledge of languages, in this case, French, he spoke French fluently, he became the liaison officer for the French heavy industry during the German occupation with <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lille</span> , <span class="REGION">northern France</span> , so I didn't see much of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I had lost my brother in mountain climbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He fell to his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So it was my mother and I, and then I didn't spend much time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I spent -- I mean much time at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And a -- well, the day came when the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> expelled me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Oh, why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Because the <span class="DLF">windowsill</span> of the old <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> , there was a board, and from the all the rain throughout the years and years and years had become brittle, and you could pick itup. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I said oh, that would be wonderful to just let's it sail down, and so one of the classmates, I says said when somebody comes let me know. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Somebody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Well, that somebody was a teacher, he just walked by, and it ended on the back of his head and then of course went into 1,000 pieces, and I was called and Dr. Fettweiss (ph), he was the director, the principal. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Nobody want to say anything, so we had these big lush eyebrows, and he went to one, did you do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Did you do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">When he came to me, I broke down and I said yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So I was expelled and then I went to I think the first <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> I went to -- or the first <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> I went to was <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , went to a very, very exclusive <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> where --
QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Gallen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">When?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  When?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Well, that must have been, let's see, that must have been about '37, I'm pretty sure, and from + and so on and so forth, and those were the kind, and my father was not that wealthy but there was somebody who liked me very much and felt that I needed -- I deserved special consideration, so I think he paid part of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So I went there for a year, but then I painted the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and so on, and so they asked me to leave, so then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bornheim</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  What, you painted the <span class="DLF">walls</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Yeah, I just -- they were -- they were blank <span class="DLF">walls</span> , so I thought, well, I should bring a little color into the environment there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I was always very artistic, even as a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So well, my father had to pay to clean the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , repaint them, and I left and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bornheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I think I wrote about my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bornheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">You want me to go into that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was -- where we slept was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a little out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So where we slept, it was an old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , like the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , old stone building, three story. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The upper stories where the director and his family lived and then the different <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were different <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> where the students lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I lived with the son of a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He always had a little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And the food was absolutely disgustingly terrible, and around Christmas time, upstairs, they were baking. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And you can imagine the aroma going through the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , but the cookies were not made for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So when I found a way, the director had gone I think to an opera or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So I found my way in and emptied the cookies and distributed them throughout the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I said, well, I better not be here when he comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So I told my roommate, I said come on, let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We put sheets together -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed sheets</span> , climbed out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and then he said, I can't go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I can't do it to my father, he'll never forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So we went in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> and waited for the director to come, and I took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And then I didn't have -- I just a few marks, I didn't have enough to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I don't know, I have gypsy blood or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I went down to the -- to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and was successful in convincing one of the captains to take me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> , you know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barges</span> that go down, and that was a very, very pleasant trip because the captain had his wife on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> with him, and I helped her to hang up or to hang her clothes that she washed, and you could see her bra and underwear and everything was flowing there with the wind, colorful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Well, that's how I arrived if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , and when I came to my mother, she already had a letter from the director of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Why do you do that to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Why can't you be different? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Your father, what is he going to say? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">You don't have to tell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Well, so I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Dusseldorg school</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ignazio</span> , and I think I was in the Obertertia, that's when I became involved in the Edelweisspiraten and found a lot of activities to dampens my adventurism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  So what was your father's reaction to, you know, that whole story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Well, he didn't know until he was told that I was arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Oh, I see.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  From the Hitler Youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Yeah, and I don't really know why we at any point in time have a Hitler Youth in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bornheim</span> , and I'll have to think about it, really, but we did not, but when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , then of course I went back to Hitler Youth, and then my activities started with the Edelweisspiraten and that was a new adventure almost every day.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  That I had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  That you detested, that you hated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Oh, several I detested. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">As a matter of fact there was one -- there was one who would ask you a question which had two answers, kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">If you answered A, he would hit you; if you answered B, he would hit you, so you couldn't please him. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We called him a Nilpferd, a hippopotamus because he had one wooden foot, so when he came {making noises}, you could hear him come. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I told my father about it, and my father of course was absolutely sure that I deserved it, until one boy came to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I think father was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , so he came and had dinner with us, and my father asked him, he said, oh, no, he hits anybody, guilty or not guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So my father looked at me -- he was a very radical man. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I'm very much like him in many ways, and he said, he hits you without a reason, you hit him back, you hear, you hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So the word run through the class, Walter's going to hit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Well, the next day he didn't hit me, and the next day he didn't hit me but then he hit me and I hit him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I hit him back and I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I ran to the <span class="BUILDING">principal's office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I said I was crying, I hit the teacher, but he hit everybody _+ My father had to come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my father raised <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The teacher was transferred to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so that was one of the -- one of the big incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Another thing, at that time, I became sexually very active at a very young age. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I found these elderly ladies who -- who took a liking to me and taught me, which was so much more interesting than <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and, well, that's the way it went until January of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Of course by that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It was very much the center of the war and food was hard to come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So in the evening I went to see my friends, the French prisoners of war that I met with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We played pool and we talked to -- about what to do next. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So we would hide their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> or -- see, there's a reflector on the fender of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> on the back so that you see it when you drive behind them, and we would hang condoms on that thing and so things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And we got away with little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We want to do something better, maybe just take one wheel out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> there with only one wheel or take the entire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> away, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I always thought what are we going to do next, and we had a group and let's go maybe during the apple season, we would get together on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Of course we all had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">racing bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I would go to next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> against the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , climb on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and then collect apples. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Swimming in between -- well, until I was arrested and --
QUESTION:  So, again, we're going to get to that in great detail.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  I don't know exactly when rationing started, but I believe that by '43 we had rationing cards and the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> began. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">My father was born in the <span class="REGION">Eiffel region</span> close to the <span class="DLF">Belgium border</span> , I mean next door to the <span class="DLF">Belgian border</span> , and so we always -- he went there and came back with butter and schmaltz and eggs, and so that when he went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> of course we always had coffee and so we did not suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Ration cards alone was I think 50 Klonfleisch, or Fleischnon, or anything that's sausage or meat at 50 gramm per week and, very little in terms of fat, butter fat, whatever, that was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So -- but the propaganda, in which the Germans probably became the masters in the world, was so that people were happy to sacrifice for the good of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so you didn't hear too many people bitch or cried or complain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  My colleague, Ann Millen, said that when you were in the exhibit, The State of Deception exhibit, that you knew the KdF jingle. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Can you sing it or hum it for us now?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Did you ever go on vacation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Yes, I was -- when I went on vacation, I was very anxious to get to my father's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , because I loved to be with animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">My great uncle -- oh, it's hard to believe, when I think about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so highly civilized and tremendous, advancement in industry and so on, well, the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holoratz</span> (ph) in the Schneeeifel, my grandmother, my father's mother, like most girls in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , were sent down in the valley to work as a maid and possibly to find a husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So my grandmother met my grandfather, and I think they went to the haystack together and my father became the result, and when the people realized that she was -- that my grandmother was pregnant, they threw stones at her until the priest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> said may he who cast the first stone, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So then up in that old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which my father was born was building 1640, and it still stands, so up -- what a very poor <span class="REGION">area</span> , 1890, poor period, and out of straw they built a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> and that's where he was born, almost like Jesus Christ, and he loved it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">He was very happy, but to give you an idea what things were like, I asked my father one day, I said something that you remember that really had an impact on you? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Yep. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">One day I was with a friend and we looked up the <span class="DLF">road</span> , the <span class="DLF">Kuhstrasse</span> it's called because the cows were driven up there to go to <span class="DLF">pasture</span> , and we saw the priest behind a tree peeing, and we looked at each other and we knew priests don't pee and we made it very clear they would not tell anybody because they would call us liars. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So the holy men don't pee. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And so in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you would see the blind obedience to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , blind obedience to the Burgermeister, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">This obedience was reflected all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , whether it was the Kaiser or whether it was Hitler, it didn't make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So it wasn't too difficult for somebody to take over and exploit this kind of sentiment, but I went there because I didn't have to brush my teeth in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I didn't have to wash up. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It was ideal. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And I tell you, you had to take care of cows, the neighbor's cows and several cows got together and I had to take them together with the dog and a stick and I had to take them to a certain <span class="DLF">pasture</span> , and the <span class="DLF">pastures</span> had no <span class="DLF">fences</span> , so I had to keep the cows from walking into the <span class="DLF">potato fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">It was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">My great aunt would make a head of bread about this size. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I remember she would put it under her bosom and make a slice of it the size -- everything was homemade, homemade ham, homemade everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  So about two feet, two and a half feet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  Yep. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And she made ciders for me to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Oh, it was so good, and I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And I remember there was a girl in the <span class="REGION">area</span> also took care of some cows, that we became friends and we started -- spoke in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lorbeerblatt</span> , whatever they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It's a shrub.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Laurel leaves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Laurel leaves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  Laurel leaf, yeah, yeah, that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So {making noise} oh, it was beautiful, so I loved to be in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I really loved to be there and I have been there many times even after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Did you know your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Yes, I knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Hated his guts. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He was a devout, stupid Catholic, stupid in the sense he didn't ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He accepted and made it his own knowledge, but he was not very nice to my mother, and he kind of respected me because I didn't agree with him and I openly said so. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I was a tough kid, and he died of diabetes, I think, and he wanted to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I said I don't want to see him, so I didn't go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  What did he do for a living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  What did he do for a living, did he just run the <span class="DLF">farm</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  No, no, he was -- he was Mannesmann (ph - correct), the famous German company, Mannesmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Among other things they built seamless pipes and they had a plant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helenta</span> (ph), which was close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holoratz</span> (ph) and he would manage the horses and take those pipes to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and they wanted him to take over the horses into sort of in the main plant, so that's how we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And then after awhile, he was a rather ambitious -- was in the army and then he joined the police force, and he made a name for himself, because he apprehended one of the most ferocious criminals at the time who had chopped up children and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was an atrocious thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And then he was extremely strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">He looked a little bit like Khrushchev, a stocky old bull, and he would accompany prisoners because they would get extra pay for that, and then he built a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So he was very ambitious and became a lieutenant and was known as the Polizeimeier, and we walked -- I had this chain here with a watch and walked, had no hair whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I mean it was just like, like bald headed old bull, and the kids saw him and said Polizeimeier, and they would disappear with their soccer balls and so on when he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But there he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">His wife had died rather young, and then he had a housekeeper and I believe also his mistress. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I don't know this, but I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So I saw him rather infrequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I didn't like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I liked my mother's father. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Yeah, he was a kind old man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  What did he do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  He was a roofer, a roofer for only <span class="BUILDING">cathedrals</span> and <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , so I have a picture of him was high, high on the upper part of the <span class="BUILDING">town church</span> , you see, and then as SA come, he was a forest ranger for a noble man, so he went hunting and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I used to see him with his long pipe, and he had the longest legs I ever seen, and he was able not only to put one leg under the other, he did one more curve and he did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Opa, do it once -- one more time, and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Oh, I got a kick out of that, and he was actually the first one I did a drawing of with my fountain pen, and my teacher didn't believe that I had done it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Which teacher was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  Which teacher, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Yeah, but I don't remember his name, my art teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I'd say Johans, but I don't guarantee that that was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And when he realized just I did it, then he took me to the Kunstakadmie for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , which is one of the best known Kunstakadmien in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And there I was exposed to weird looking professors with beards, I mean they look like hippies but hippies in the '40s, and my first thing was to nacktzeichnen. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">That means draw nudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Well, you know, at 11 or 12 years old, to see a naked lady in front of you, it rather left an impact on me and I don't know, I guess my pencil was a little shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I remember when I used my single little bit of __ + Everything had to be done with a pencil. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Well, that's where I had my first art instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I didn't last very long, I think three months or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">There was always something. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Then -- then -- then my parents had a friend who was an opera singer and I was a happy guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I always sang, and he heard my voice I think in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> I was singing, and he said do you mind if I give a private lessons? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And he was going to prepare me for the <span class="BUILDING">music conservatory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I had to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I had to sing Schubert's An die Musik {singing}. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Oh, very difficult song. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And they thought I was not quite good enough as a soloist, so I thought that I would be all right in the choir, and I didn't think that I -- I think I was too good for the choir, so I didn't stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So I had many interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I had a problem that I was born with quite a few talents, none of them developed to the extreme, but I knew this and I knew this and I knew this and I knew a little of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I learned languages just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So I had a problem I want to be a movie star. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I wanted to be locomotive driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I wanted to be, you name it, so anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">More questions, please.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Why did you leave the <span class="BUILDING">Kunstakademie</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">You said something happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  Oh, just because. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">That was not -- that was -that was a volunteer thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I went there in addition to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So I just didn't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So I don't want to go back, and since my father was not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there was nobody who could handle me. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">See, my mom -- father handled me brutally, and my mother tried love but she was not quite strong enough, poor little woman, so...
QUESTION:  I think now would be a good time for a break, so...
ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Interview with Walter Meyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So Herr Meyer, you said over the break you had fun in the Junkvolk. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Could you explain, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The Jungvolk was very much like the Boy Scouts, little camping trips, and it would please me enormously that I became a drummer, and so I could show off with my drum and get a little attention that way, which I needed badly, and even my mother said would you show me again, drum a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So I drummed and I sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I was a happy little fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So the Jungvolk was, I would have to admit that it was a pleasure for a young boy to join the Jungvolk, and I repeat, it was just as enjoyable as it is my son to be part of the Boy Scouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  You had an opportunity to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler Schule</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">What is an <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler Schule</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">What does that entail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler Schule</span> was a select -- I think there were two, maybe three out of <span class="BUILDING">Hitler school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they were there to train, indoctrinate young men to become leaders, let's say, with some exaggeration, like the LBJ School of Public Affairs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> who will train people to become excellent in government administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">This was a little similar, but only one sided, in other words, all under the umbrella of national socialism. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And to enter there, you had to go through -- you would have to be highly recommended and you had to go through a <span class="BUILDING">preschool</span> , through a screening process and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So I think my father didn't quite know what was involved, so I went to the, to the first essetapa canâ€™t identify word (ph), the first step of a <span class="BUILDING">screening school</span> , passed that, and then my father got a letter which he had to sign and he refused to sign because he thought that was a little too much for a young man and he just did not agree. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So he didn't sign, so I didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So the <span class="BUILDING">Hitler school</span> was maybe the equivalent, if you want to compare to going to a <span class="BUILDING">Jesuit school</span> to become a priest, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It would be totally a one- sided education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  I mean were you upset that you couldn't go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Why my father didn't like it?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Did you experience any schooling in the Hitler Youth, any schooling in the Hitler Youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Not schooling per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">You had of course theoretical instructions in the branch. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Let's say the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">You would learn about how <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> operate, the size of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and what you do in the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So the theoretical part you would learn, and how to speak with flags and the different ranks, history of the navy, yes, but most of it was the practical aspect of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">You would learn how to -- how to use breathing apparatus underwater. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">You would learn to connect magnetic bombs underwater and you would <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to bomb <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> underwater, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that would be anchored in a <span class="DLF">port</span> and --
QUESTION:  How did you react to that training, did you like it, hate it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was adventurous, because you would swim with clothes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">You would swim with clothes and shoes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I mean there were scenarios where you would think that you under pressure and you have a gun with you and how can you swim with all this weight and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So it was an interesting scenario, yes, and besides you would -- you would be treated as somewhat of a special guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">You were a prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">You were a little champion, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Well, were you treated with a little more respect like -- than an ordinary guy and...
QUESTION:  Now, you were talking about competition in the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Can you explain how that works?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Before the Hitler Youth existed, swimmers or athletes in general would represent a club, let us say that I would swim for the swim club of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and we would have a big swim meet going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> sponsored by the federation -- swimming federation and invite clubs from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , from all around they would come and swim here. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Well, the Hitler Youth took over, so now I would swim representing the Hitler Youth, Section 6 of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , swimming against the Hitler Youth, Section 9 of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , and there whether different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> represented different sections of the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So to find out who was the best swimmer in the Hitler Youth, okay, and it culminated in the Reichsjugendmeisterschaft, that means the youth championship in swimming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  And you participated in that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Yes, twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  How did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  I was third once and fourth once, so I was --
QUESTION:  So pretty high up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Well, pretty high up. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I was -- I was all right but I was not on top, and really I participated in the German championship, the open championship and I was third and that was pretty good, but you had to consider that some of the best swimmers were already in the Navy, so they didn't participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So my competition was rather limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Can you sum up your experience in the Hitler Youth but as a favor or a colleague, can you say it in Spanish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  {Speaking Spanish} 58:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Les juventud hitlerisito pues eres una organization un poquito comos los Boy Scouts, dividido lo mes moque, lo fuerzas armados, lo armado fuerzas eres, lo marina y por su puesto como matodar, y tuve que entrar en lo armada y hi un entrentor como especialiste en colorer bombes bejo agua, y me divedi mucho porque cada dis ero algo interesante y aprende mucho de los barcos, de los uniformes, lo historie de la armada, los diferentes guerres. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Y ...une orgulloro de mi mismo y de lo juventud hitleristo brewso companeros habis muy pocos que critica todo ero uno coso positive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Let's turn to the edelweiss pirates. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Can you tell me about them, how they were formed, how that worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  The edelweiss pirates -- well, edelweiss is the flower that only grows up in the high mountains of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">It's a pretty flower and it represents bravery, strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">My brother tried to pick edelweiss for his mother and fell to his death and they found him with edelweiss in his hands, so edelweiss in my family was something very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">A group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> started the Edelweisspriaten, how did you hear about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  News got around they were persecuted, as you would hear about saboteur and committed sabotage and so on, and that triggered an interest in we could do something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And there was enough hatred, disrespect for our leaders, and I'm talking about our immediate leaders, that means companions who now became lieutenants and captains and we had to respect and salute them and listen to them and obey them, and that was definitely against my nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I found quite a few comrades who, for adventurous reasons, for one reason or the other sided with me and said yeah, let's have some fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So I have to emphasize that I was a little too young, even though after the war, we were considered political prisoners, but really, there was no real ideological reason because I didn't understand national socialism as I would understand it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It was more of a movement based upon rebellious nature, protest against blind obedience, this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So we formed a chapter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> and hoped that eventually we would establish contact with the Edelweisspiraten in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So then we spent quite a bit of time thinking of what we could do to make their, in quote, their life more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Who 1s the their?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Well, our leaders, the ones we hated, our captains and lieutenants and captains.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  In the Hitler Youth then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Yeah, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  So how many of them were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Oh, we were about 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  So 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Your group was 12, and you then, as a group, decided we can do this or that against the Hitler Youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  So what are some of the -- some of the things that you thought up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Ha, well, I told you before we would -- all the reflectors on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , we could hang condoms there, and especially we would put them there in the dark so they would not discover them right away and take them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They would ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and then somebody started laughing because they drove behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So we'd do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Steal the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Deflate the tires, we would do that rather frequently, paint things on their -- put poo poo on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Did you have other fun, did you do other things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  We would generally meet in what was called in <span class="BUILDING">Dusseldorf Cafe Meintz</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="415">They had in the back, they had <span class="INT_SPACE">billiard room</span> , so we'd play pool. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">That's where we had our meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">What are we going to do next, and so fun, as I said I became interested in women, had an affair with our mail woman and looked for adventure of any sort, but in this particular framework, it was generally thinking about how can we make those stupid idiots' life a little more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  So does that mean you dropped out of the Hitler Youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Dropped out? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">That would have been impossible because it was obligatory to join. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">You had to have a qualified reason, like maybe losing one leg or something like that, that you couldn't do it, but as long as you were healthy and you didn't have Jewish blood for five generations, then you had to join.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  So how did that work, being a part of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against them at the same time? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">How did it work being part of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against them at the same time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  Ha. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Well of course we tried to be as clandestine as possible, so on the surface, we were just very loyal members of the Hitler Youth and our movement was rather underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So it was so it was what in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you call Schikane, based upon our dislike for authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  How did your parents react to this? </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Did they even know what you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  They didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">My father was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> so there was only my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I was the only one left. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">My brother had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He died 1n'41. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And so I was the only one left and she never knew what I was and sometimes I didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night, and the poor woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Why are you -- I didn't know, I just -- I should have been born in <span class="REGION">west Texas</span> on a big <span class="DLF">ranch</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Do you remember their names, your friends in the edelweiss pirates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  Oh, there was -- yeah, there was Eddie Violent (ph) was one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Was he a good friend, Eddie Violent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  Yes, he still is. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">He's dying, but I talk to him once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">He's still hanging in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  How did you meet him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  He was a neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  And how did you --
ANSWER:  He's the one, Eddie, who took over -- who took over the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish bar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">When I was arrested, Eddie knew him, so he went over and stayed -- for the rest of the war, he stayed with Eddie.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  So explain that. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">How did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="450">You're in the edelweiss pirates and you decide you're going to hide a Jewish boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Maybe -- maybe -- I don't know, maybe I should think a little more about what I did and how I did it, but maybe one of the things was that we did not enjoy the procedure of the Hitler Youth being helpful in the prosecution of Jews, which they were, and I had these friends, they didn't do any harm to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They were nice kids and so on, and so we were very much interested in helping the underdog. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So we considered the Jews underdogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And so this one guy, when we knew they were being evacuated and sent to <span class="NPIP">places</span> , well, we didn't want him to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I didn't know his parents, and so I just thought one day if you don't want to go, you can stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And so he stayed with me for, oh, I don't know, I would say probably six months or eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And it was not broadcast in my family that he's a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It was just he's a young man who needs a little help and can he stay with us? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Yeah, he can sleep in my brother's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And so in the <span class="BUILDING">apartment housing</span> which we lived in, there were a total of six parties, +. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So they didn't know that he was a Jewish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">It was not broadcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">He was just a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And so when I was arrested, then -- I believe that when I had a visit with -- from my mother, the question came out of what are we going to do with Hans Dieter (ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I said call Eddie Violent he's going to take care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So he took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">That was just one block from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and his situation was a little nicer because he lived a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was his. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So he had a little more freedom and who walked in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And he stayed with him for the rest of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">What happened with him afterwards, I do not know, and I asked Eddie and he didn't know -- oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">He told me one day, he said guess what? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">You you remember Hansâ€™? </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">He died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  What was his name, Hans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Hans Dieter Von Schwejk (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Von Schweyjk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  But I don't know whether the parents ended up most likely in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I don't know details. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I don't know what happened to him after the war, so...
QUESTION:  So your -- your friend, I mean he was in the edelweiss pirates with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Did he have scathingly brilliant ideas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Eddie, yeah, Eddie is extremely, extremely talented with his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">He can build anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I have to ship a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He built a stainless <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I have to ship it, it's too damn heavy, but I have to ship it to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So he would help us many if we want to break in somewhere, he would give us the key or the Dietrich it's called in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It's kind of thing that fits any lock. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So he would do things like that, and yeah, anything mechanical and so on, he would help. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">That was mostly his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He was not a very athletic type. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He was more the thinker and the doer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Was there anything else that you did because it was against policy of the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  I think what was more than anything was that you could not argue. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">You could not discuss. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">You had to accept whatever was said as the final truth, and I liked the idea of asking why and how and you couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So that was a little against my nature of just accepting things blindly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  So where did you get non-government information from? </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Where did you get that information?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  From radio, BBC, from some foreign magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">My father bought some <span class="BUILDING">home</span> once in awhile, books.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Tell me about the POWs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  The POW? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Well, my father was a linguist, and as a little boy, he would see to it that I spoke French. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So he would tell me in French, get me my slippers or good evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And so I know my father or I knew my father only as pere, which is father in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I never called him Papi or father, it's always pere. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And so not too far from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">paper machine factory</span> , and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> were French prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And understand that there were quite a few <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> where they put the prisoners in the bottom and made the enemy -- somehow made the enemy know that there were prisoners so they wouldn't bomb the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and kill their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And so the lower <span class="DLF">windows</span> had these had these iron bars, and through them I could see them and there was enough to shake hands or to give them something, so I went there once and practiced French. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Bonsoir, mes amis. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Comment Â¢a va? </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And so -- Qu'est-ce que vous avez besoin? </span><span class="sentence" id="517">What do you need. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I remember one gave me a little piece of wood and he had written down, when will the French prisoners of war be liberated? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I thought oh, God, I have no answer for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I felt a little bad that I didn't have an answer, but I brought them things to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I didn't have much, but I brought them a little bread or things. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And then they gave me letters to send, and when my father came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town-</span> that was one thing about my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">He was very much in favor of helping the underdog, and you should see the testimony he got from French men after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And he became an immediate chief interpreter of the French military government because -- so anyway, I gave them the letters and he would see that the letters would go to their destination in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and I would get answers back, and so I was the middle man kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And yeah, I was -- I went there at least three times -- three times a week and somehow -- you know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , neighbors know what you're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I mean you cannot do anything without somebody knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Spitzel. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">They watch over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So somehow my activities with the French prisoners of war became known, not to the point where they prosecuted me immediately or looked for me, but it became known. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So that 1s what the judge brought up, and you know, from the police when I was arrested and went to the police pres -- first through polizei revier Polizeirevier, and then to the polizei presidio Polizeiprasidium and then the Gestapo until eventually I went to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but then things came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">You like French, huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">That's how it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So I don't remember your last question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Well, I just asked you about the POWs, what your relationship with them --
ANSWER:  Yeah, oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The POWs. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So those -- those -- that's my POWs. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">That's why I tried to help them with a little food here and there and take their letters and bring them mail from their families, and so they were happy to see me and I was happy to practice a little French with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Did you experience the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  Can you explain how that worked, what that process was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Well, of course the siren, when it started, went {making noise} and then when it was over it would go {making noise}., </span><span class="sentence" id="544">monotone. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Well, when it started, everybody would run as fast as possible into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> or to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">There were <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and then would you hear the bombs falling. </span><span class="sentence" id="547"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> was destroyed 75 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So yeah, and in '43, it became a nightly affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="549"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> or the vicinity was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It's a very <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial city</span> and very close to the <span class="REGION">rural region</span> where all the steel industry of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is So...
QUESTION:  So I mean were you personally affected by the bombing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  By affected, you would wake up in the morning, and these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> over there didn't exist anymore, they were ruins and you would have to go a long way around to get where you wanted to go and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And you heard that such and such family, they were killed during the bombardment. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And I heard once this guy, believe it or not, he survived with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He ended up in the other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And so, yeah, that's how I was affected, and we lived south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was a residential area which was not heavily bombed.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Did he say anything to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  Yeah, he was very angry to me, as a matter of fact, he got behind me an orfieger (ph), and they're going to teach you how to treat a German police officer, and so on, these words, and, oh, maybe an hour later, I was taken to the Polizeiprasidium, which would be equal to a <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> , and there they tried to get the documents together since mine is a rather common name where my parents live, the address, birth date, et cetera, et cetera, and when all that was done and I was asked what I had done and I played kind of innocent, I haven't done anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Well, we will find out about you if you don't want to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So I was at the <span class="BUILDING">Polizeiprasidium</span> and that's where interrogation continued, or let's say it started all over again, the same questions, and I gave the same answers, but then I realized they knew more than I knew about me, and when that verhor, that interrogation ended, I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> , and they then forgot the matter of the shoes very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">That was not even mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They kind of wanted to hear about the Edelweisspiraten, my contact with French prisoners of war and my membership in the Hitler Youth and why I had done that, and one of them seemed to be a little -- what's the word I'm looking for? </span><span class="sentence" id="641">He didn't quite trust me. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So I was asked to undress, and then they looked at my genitals -- genitals and one says, It's a Juden. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">This is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Well, then they called someone who was more of an expert, and he didn't quite know what to do with me, and then they got a super experts, ehnrasseenkundige (ph), and he looked at me and he realized that that no, I was not really circumcised, it was only half circumcision or something like that, and so I was able to get dressed again and one told me boy, you're lucky you got away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">You're lucky you're not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I got dressed again, and then all this took an hour, two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And then I was driven to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> I was given prison clothing and I was taken to my <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , which was going to be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for I guess about a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION:  Was that a <span class="BUILDING">youth facility</span> or was that --
ANSWER:  Oh, no, it was --
QUESTION:  An <span class="BUILDING">adult prison</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">ANSWER:  It was a regular <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , yeah, and I drove by there many times when I went to workout at the <span class="BUILDING">swim club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We drove by the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We made jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We call it the -- the -- it had a special name. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We called coffee so-and-so, <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> so-and-so, and of course at that time I never dreamed that I would become an occupant of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Well, I was in one <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">It was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , with one <span class="DLF">window</span> , and with a little effort I could look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , at least a little part of it, and I saw a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and my neighbor next door, a young man, he yelled all day long, by all day long, liebataten dieant (ph), and God, it was horrible to listen, until his voice got really horse, liebataten (ph), and I heard that later on he ate his own feces and was taken to a <span class="BUILDING">state hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So well, in the morning, we were to take our kubel, we called it, it was a container out of ceramic container, big container and we had to take this one behind the other and go to the main section where we emptied it and rinsed it and then took it back, and in the meantime there, we were able to sit down a row of people and do our business, went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I think maybe the third or fourth day, I was asked to join a group, and we were supposed to sew buttons on <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> for soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Then I did another job with something like weeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And then I have to emphasize this over and over again, that I tried every -- I mean I dreamed of escaping, and so I figured that if I don't eat for awhile I'm going to faint probably and they'd take me to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I can easily escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So I didn't eat for ten days, and yeah, I kind of fainted, but instead of taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they whipped my butt, because they realized I did this not as an accident but purposely. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So that didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Well, I was in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> until April the 12th when I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and that's where I saw -- after awhile I saw my parents for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">My father, my mother was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They looked very stern. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">My mother was crying and my father had engaged the services of two attorneys that didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I assumed the attorneys didn't really have much power. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They had to say yes and no, and be very obedient to the judge who was the most powerful autocrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And so then the ceremony began. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Walter Meyer, stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">You're Walter Meyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">You're accused of plunder. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">That was the prosecuting attorney talking, and I don't know whether you're aware, but this automatically called for the death penalty, and one of the attorneys jumped and held my arm, and said that's not the last word. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And, well, they narrated, esplundern aktivitaten the Edelweisspiraten forbid den know mitsa creeks fangen and so on.(ph) And then they rested their case, and then they excused themselves and went to have I assume a conference of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And they came back, the judge then made it clear, said I cannot call this plundern. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The most I can call it einfacher Diebstahl, simple theft, and I have even questions about that, but this young man needs a strong remedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He obviously doesn't quite fit into into what our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> needs and contact with the enemy destroying state property, all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">However, I have take in to consideration that he was an outstanding athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I also consider that that he lost one brother and -- but I feel that I should give him a minimum or maximum penalty, which means that after one year of good conduct, he can join the armed forces, so he's got a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It all depends upon him. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So it's one to four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">If he doesn't have good behavior then he has to stay for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Do you understand that? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Yes, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">That was the end of the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Then I was taken -- went back to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Maybe three, four, five days later I was called, get dressed and I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and from there, I went what is called a German auft transport. (</span><span class="sentence" id="693">ph) I went first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Klinger Priz prison</span> , (ph) which was rather interesting because we were in <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> that had to be vacated every so often, because from there you could look down at the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where they would chop heads, okay and we were not supposed to see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Well, we heard this - the stotten clerk (ph) bim, bim, bim, bim.{making noises} So we had to move to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and when the storm was over we went back, but that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> was so full of bugs- red bugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Oh, it was disgustingly dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But I was there maybe two days, three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">From there, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coblenz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coblenz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> then by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Butzbach</span> , and from there we walked, that means a policeman and I. Policeman looked at me and said, look, let's not have any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Walk nicely next to me and we won't have any problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Don't try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Don't make my life difficult, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So he delivered to me to the <span class="BUILDING">Rockenberg youth prison</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  Before one more, Walter, do you think you can talk about the trial in Spanish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  Yes, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  So do you want to start?</span></p>

I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">QUESTION:  So you arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">youth detention center</span> , the jugendstrafanstalt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So what did you see there, what did you -- what met you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">ANSWER:  What did I see in the jugendstrafanstalt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  When you arrived, how did that work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  Well, first, I was impressed by -- sounds a little funny in prison setting, sounded beautiful, but this was a beautiful setup because it was not a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> per se, but 1t used to be a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> or <span class="BUILDING">cloister</span> and the <span class="REGION">area</span> was rather, rather attractive, and well, like in every <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , first you surrender the clothes you have, and they give you a prison uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , which would be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for awhile, and we had lessons there of geography and so on and so forth, I mean, not very considerable but maybe -- maybe twice a week or maybe only once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I don't remember too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And my neighbor - my neighbor in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> there after, he was kind of a, like later in the concentration, in the capo, he was a privileged prisoners, his <span class="DLF">cell door</span> was always open. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">He could walk in and out when he want to, and I found out that he had killed his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">But see killing your father was not as bad as helping French prisoners of war, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Anyway in my <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , and then a week, two weeks later, then they found out that I hid -- I had more education than the rest of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They were more of the lower echelon of society, so it was an elderly police employee who was the buyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">He would buy vegetables and things that the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> need, and they needed an assistant and he picked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And as such of course I could have survived forever there and I would have gained quite a bit of weight because the food was at my disposal, and so I did that for awhile until I had the problem with my attempt to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Do you want me to go into that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  Please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  Well, I was supposed to take control over certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">That means I had -- I did a little bureaucracy, what we bought and so on, and nicely organized, and I was in the part of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that was the <span class="BUILDING">cloister</span> at one time, very thick <span class="DLF">walls</span> , but I found a little <span class="DLF">window</span> where the bars, one bar was loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I could take it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I assume -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , and so it was wear and tear over the years and years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So I figured that would be my chance to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And I wrote a little note to my father, whom I expected to visit, and a little map where he would have to expect me and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I mean it was nicely detailed, small letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I folded that, put it in my pocket, and somehow, I don't know how, but I lost the little piece of paper and it was found and I was called before the warden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  What made you think your father would help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  I would climb out and he would be waiting with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  Well, what made you think that your father would agree to that, that he would help? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Did you believe your father would help?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  No question?</span></p>

QUESTION:  So why did you want to work in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> anyway, I mean that's hard work?</span></p>
