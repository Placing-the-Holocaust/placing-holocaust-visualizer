<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Now, if you will state your name, please, where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name now is Jacob Gert (ph) Weiner. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , on March 25, 1917. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">At that time, my name was Copper Gert Sweenetski (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  I think I would like to start by talking a little bit about pre-war life, your memories of your family and what life was like before Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So can you tell me a little bit what it was like growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , which was the second biggest <span class="DLF">port</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And we lived in the southern part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neustadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And my parents had a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father had a <span class="BUILDING">bicycle business</span> , <span class="BUILDING">repair shop</span> , selling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And we had a very nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And my parents got married in 1916. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I'm the oldest of four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I have two brothers -- I had two brothers and one sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Did you -- was your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> a mostly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , or were you part of a larger community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  In the Neustadt where we lived, there were not many Jews living. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> was in the , that means on the northern part of the . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And we had to walk there to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which was about 35 to 40 minutes walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Were most of your friends Jewish, or did you have a lot of Gentile friends as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  We were very friendly with our neighbors, most of whom were not Jewish, and we played together with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> I went to were mostly non-Jewish people, non-Jewish teachers, non-Jewish friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  To a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> first, and afterwards to a kind of <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which ts called an oberealshure (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  So you were very comfortable in the general community. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">That was your world?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  We felt very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We were not one of the richest, but we made a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And my father was respected as a very good mechanic. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">People came to him with repairs and bought <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And my mother was, so to say, the bookkeeper and taking care of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And she had the very good handwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">At that time we hadn't <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span> , and people came from far and wide and had her write letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Were you involved in cultural activities or community activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  To a certain extent, with the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and I had religious lessons there in the afternoon, because we did not have a <span class="BUILDING">day school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So I went in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And besides this, I was very friendly with some people, some youngsters who lived a little further out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hammerlichen</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And those Jewish people whom I saw there, it was a two hours walk, but I went on the weekends several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and they had settled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There was a difference in the Jewish community between what they call the ost stuent (ph) and the west stuent (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And I felt very comfortable with the ost stuent (ph), too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Did -- were you involved in any political organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Not really, but I remember that sometime before Hitler came to power, 1932, I remember, I was associated of going with the Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And in the Zionist organization, it was more leftist. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I did not like this, because they are very close to Communism, and I did not like it, and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And some 30 or 40 other youngsters left with me, and we joined a different organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  This was also a political organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was not really a political organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It was more or less a religious organization, a of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What did you do in that organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  We tried to teach people something about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And we also tried them how to behave in the Nazi -- during the -- in the Nazi time. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And, but we were not political in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We did not want to join any political movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Judaism was quite important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was very important to me, because despite the fact that my father was not very religious and my mother came from a religious family. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But I felt more religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And especially through teachers whom I had there in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish religious school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  And at this time, prior to 1933, there were never any obstacles to you expressing your Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No, not to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">However, to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I remember that already in 1928 when we went for a trip to the <span class="DLF">park</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , the Nazis were very influential, and they just had received 107 people, I think, 107 members in the <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And they came into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> where we were riding, into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> where we were riding, and my mother was very much afraid that Jewish life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would become different, which it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I saw many times that -- that the Nazis had in mind to exterminate all the Jews, especially in the non-Jewish school where I went, they sometimes ridiculed me and they said to me, "Go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> , go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You don't belong here."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  These were other students?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Students, yeah, from the non-Jewish school.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  And this was all prior to --
ANSWER:  This was even prior to Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  So you were -- you were fairly aware of Naziism before Hitler came to power, then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But we never thought that he would get power, because the largest party in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were the social democrats.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  So how did all of this start escalating when Hitler came to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  When Hitler came to power in January 1933, we listened to the radio, and we thought that it would only last a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Because we had non-Jewish friends living near us, and they told us, "Don't worry, it will only last a little while, and it cannot go on this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It will stop." </span><span class="sentence" id="78">However, by that time, many youngsters and many other people had joined the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Some of them joined the party even though they were not 100 percent convinced about Hitler and had no -- much belief in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Why did they join the party?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  They knew things would change. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And there were different reasons, because of the political speeches which Hitler made, because of blaming the Jews for having mishandled and brought <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into such a mishap, like the S.I. and all kinds of things, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And they blamed the Jews on it, because that was one thing in order to get the -- to unite the party against Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So did you sense that the people in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> started to believe this and believe in all of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  There were some people who did not believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , even more than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was more Communistic at that time than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> was still, when they had the elections in 1933, 64 percent social democrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And many times, I saw Nazis coming to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> who told me, "I'm really a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But I have to cover it up, because if they ever found out, they would send me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ," because they already had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  So you didn't feel that 1t was going to be this serious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  We felt -- we felt that every day had got more serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Because in the very beginning, when they had the seven states -- seven days of celebration, when Hitler came to power, afterwards when they had the Reister (ph) fire, the burning of the ragster (ph) at the end of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And then finally, when on April Ist, they had the first progrune, (ph) the day of solidarity, they called 1t, when -- which happened to be on the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And Jews were not allowed to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Non-Jews could go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So we really felt it was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Also, they forbade right away Schreichter (ph), that means slaughtering according to Jewish custom. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So we felt it was getting bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Now, how did the attitudes of your friends, your teachers, start changing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  In the beginning, they still came to our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But as time went on, when Hitler made a law that all the parties were prohibited, except the Nazi national party, national socialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And anyone who joins Jews, who talks to Jews, then they slowly kept away from Jews, from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And it happened before, you see, that they tried to do something against it that we should not have business anymore, and take away the business from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Can you -- do you have specific memories of situations with good friends of yours who were not Jewish, or your teachers, how they started changing toward you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  There were many changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Let's talk about, if I may, so talk about our neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We had a neighbor who had also -- who had been placed there by the Nazis and had also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and <span class="BUILDING">repair shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And he didn't know very much about the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He came to my father, and my father taught him and gave him business and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">One day, the Nazis told him to build a high <span class="DLF">wall</span> near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so high that we could not look out anymore, completely close our <span class="DLF">windows</span> , just in order to take away business from us, even though he came to us and he wanted to -- he needed it, because he didn't know too much about the mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Regarding the youngsters, the children, more or less, they were forced to join the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And as soon as they joined the Hitler Youth, they were not allowed to have any more contact with Jewish people, with me and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But the teachers, if that's what you are asking me, were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The teachers were a different generation, the generation before. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And they felt that it was not right to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And quietly taking me apart, they told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But not publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  So for a while, you still were in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , the teachers were kind to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Things didn't change too much initially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In fact the teacher told me at that time in 1934, they made a law that Jewish children, especially orthodox Jewish children, were no longer allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They used to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And when they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Sabbath, they would not write, would not take baggage along. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Now they said, "If you come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you have to do everything." </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So I went to my teacher and I said to him, "I don't want to come any more on Sabbath." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">He said to me, "Why don't you want to come anymore?" </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I said to him, "You know, when Hitler came to power, Hitler wanted Germans to know about their background as Germans, to give them a certain sense of identity, according to what he thinks is the identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So I want to go a little bit back to my own identity to being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I want to be more Jewish now. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">You want to be more Nazi; I want to be more Jewish."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  This was brave in 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And then the teacher told me, "What I will do to you is, whatever I teach on the Sabbath, I will tell the students to give you the notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And besides this, on Sabbath, I will teach them Mein Kampf, Hitler's book, so you won't be there."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Why do you think the teachers -- was this a risk for the teachers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  It was a certain risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But they did not do it publicly. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They put on the Nazi emblem, which was like a life saver, double ring, with a swastika in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And the teacher told me I had to put this on. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">This is my life saver. "</span><span class="sentence" id="144">They are taking away my job," and many jobs from teachers were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The principal of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I went, non-Jewish, was retired, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The teachers at that time were about between 50 and 60 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  I'm trying to get a sense of how all this started changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And my guess is that every year it certainly got worse in terms of your ability to spend time with your Gentile friends, or your teachers' relationships with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">How did life start changing? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Do you remember any specific people or instances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We were good friends with people, neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And there were some young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We came together; we played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There was a <span class="DLF">yard</span> , what they call a <span class="DLF">playground</span> like this, not far from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And we played together with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I even went on bicycle tours with some of these people and everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I even have a picture at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I am in this picture with the neighbors, the non-Jewish people who were with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They were all very nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">However, it changed because everyone was forced -- two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They were forced number one to join the Hitler Youths. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And number two, they were forced to tell the Hitler Youths of what their parents thought about the Nazis at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And so slowly it infiltrated to the parents and to others, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And they felt it was not safe anymore to talk to Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  And they stopped talking to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Slowly, they stopped talking to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Then later on, they started to avoid us by walking on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or by just not talking to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Were they ever abusive or violent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  No, not in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But you could not complain, because there were still people there who were of the old type. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I remember that one day I went to the -- a fair, which they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> nor far from us, and they showed a puppet show. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And in the puppet show, they showed how the one person went against the Jews, boop, boop, boop. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So I asked a policeman there, which actually was stupid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But I asked the policeman, "Why do you show such shows?" </span><span class="sentence" id="176">You see, "Why do they show such shows here," you see. "</span><span class="sentence" id="177">The Jews are also people." </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He didn't answer, because the answer was simply, "Because this regime is against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">That's why we have to infiltrate the public, and we have to make them aware that Jews are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And they have to be done away with."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  As time went on, were you ever hurt or abused in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Not directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But I remember that one day, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> , the boys came and they took away my hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And they threw it up, and they tried to hurt and beat me. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And, but I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Somehow I got this hat back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Were you ever afraid? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Did your parents start getting fairly worried about the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  My mother was very much afraid of this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And my father, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But, so we started quite early, 1934, '35, or even before that, to find relatives or people all over in the world, wherever we thought we had some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Because some of my mother's relatives had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Some had gone to <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And my father, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was out of the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">To find out if they would be able to help us getting out, because we want to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And the only way, especially after the Nuremberg laws, 1935, and then 1936, they made it like imperative to move out. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We couldn't stay there anymore, because the business got worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Was your father's business closed down?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Eventually, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They made very little -- they earned very little in that business. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And they had something like what's called a community project whereby they collected food and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And we even had to use some of this food in order to live, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Now, you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Yeah, even later. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I graduated from some kind of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  And then you went -- then you went onto --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Then 1936 when I graduated from there, through the help of a teacher, a Jewish teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt am Main</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt am Main</span> for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We considered this, like, instead of military service, Jewish service, you see, because many people there prepared what they called Hashra (ph), which means preparation for moving out to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">At that time it was very difficult even to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because it was under British dominion, and the British didn't want anyone there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  So you went to -- you went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And things -- were things more difficult, less difficult there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , contrary to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , we lived in a Jewish -- more of a Jewish environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And at that time, we did not feel so much about what the outside world did. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But we read, of course, the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> after one year, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And this <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span> was not far from the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And there, I saw every day <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> , dozens of them, covered up with tarpaulin, with machine guns, moving to the front, to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to all kinds of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  What did you make of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  So we thought -- of course, this was done secretly. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But we knew or we thought that this was a preparation for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Of course, now, you were thinking about war. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">You weren't necessarily thinking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">You see, at that time we knew there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Because already in 1933, '34, '33, when they had the Sachsenhausenbergerhomme (ph), we heard from friends of ours, Jewish friends, that they had received urns of ashes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And it said, "This person was killed while trying to flee," or, "This person committed suicide," or, "This person had been ill." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And so we knew something was going on there, but we didn't really know what was going on there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Do you -- do you have memories of any of the book burnings or any of some of the more violent outbursts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I remember the book burning was early in May 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And just because of curiosity, I wanted to go and see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So I went out, 1t was in the evening, about 9:00, 10:00 o'clock, I went out to this big <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they had all the books and they were burning the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And I was standing from afar. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And I saw all of the -- thrust all of the books into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookcase</span> , into this fire and burned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So I saw the book burning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  What did you make of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  I only thought, "They don't know what they are doing." </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Because these were some of the most intelligent people, you see, that burned the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They probably don't know anything about these books, you see, just to burn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I say, by burning books, you cannot really do much, because other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> have the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And so the books wouldn't get lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Was it frightening at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Europe was frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Do you have memories of <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> closing down, or any other violent outbursts prior to Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  Prior to Kristallnacht, we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> what we called great big <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And there were two or three <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> in the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And they had actually built <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> which were new at that time, you see, were the newest kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">There was one <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> by a Jewish person who had for the first time this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And this went up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And people went there a lot, just because of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span> , I think, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And they were closed and taken over by non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Or if they were not taken over directly by non-Jews, a non-Jew was made the chief manager of that <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I think it was Bamberger's department store, if I remember, and certain others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Did -- I mean, did this make it more difficult to start getting things to have a normal life? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Not just the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , but in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  We tried to live a normal life as much as was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And we tried to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as soon as possible and to find some way of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">You could not change, because since we had this business, and my father knew this business, and we were helping him in this business, that was a way, you see, we could make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You couldn't just change and do a different job. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Because eventually he was thrown out of the , which means the trade union, and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And they even tried to -- to find something out against him, like they came in and they bought certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And then they said, "These things were stolen." </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And they want to accuse him of having stolen these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They came in and buying things at a different price, and just to say, "He oversells, he overprices," and things of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But thank God, he was -- they couldn't put anything on him, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But they tried.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  How did you all combat this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  It was very hard, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I was not then so much involved anymore in the business, because I was living away, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I was more in a Jewish environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But my mother felt very bad about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And my father, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And they tried to handle the situation as best as could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And with the little they had, they continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Actually, Kristallnacht did not start at Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It started, I think, on the 28th of October, when a number of students from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I had been at that time were of Polish descent, and they were sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And that's where the story of Herschel Grynszpan comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They were sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">First they were sent to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And we went there and we threw packages of food in there, and we tried to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And we tried to tell them so-and-so. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Then when the Germans and the Poles concluded their contract, I mean, the negotiations, then suddenly it stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which had been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was like this: A part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they could go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they could stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Even the Polish were just as much anti-Semitic as the Germans, maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And the people in the middle were in No Man's Land. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And that's where Herschel Grynszpan came. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But two weeks later on November 9th, the 10th, was the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">No one thought of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">What happened is this: On the day before Kristallnacht, we were studying 1n <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a test which should have been the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I had already been a student and a teacher in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the same time, because I spoke a little bit of Spanish, so I gave a little bit Spanish classes in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from October to November. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then in the night it happened, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> early on that evening, because I wanted to study some more. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And besides this, I wanted to have a good night's sleep for the test the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You want to hear more about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So we went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Then in the middle of the night, about 2:30 or 3:30, I don't remember anymore the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I think it was -- 1t was the night that I remember, the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We heard noise coming in, into the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> where I stayed, which was in this little side <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And I woke up my colleagues, and I said to them, "What shall we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">There is noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Shall we go and find out where the noise comes from?" </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So we waited, and we heard -- the noise got louder. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So I said to them, "Let's make sure we are safe." </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So the <span class="DLF">window</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the top, barricaded so we couldn't even go through that <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Outside, there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And outside the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So I said to them, "The best thing is we get dressed now. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And if anything should happen, we are ready to encounter whatever there is." </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And I said, "Let's get our bags ready, if anything should happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And then I said, "Let's maybe hide under the -- under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , or in that corner." </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And then I decided, "No, we don't -- shouldn't hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We should just meet it head-on." </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So there was a <span class="DLF">door</span> , one <span class="DLF">door</span> , with a little lock. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">First I tried to lock it, but then I said, "It's no use. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">If they come, they come." </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And they did come. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They made a lot of noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They came in, and they saw our suitcases there. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And they said, "Take these suitcases and throw them against the <span class="DLF">window</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They wouldn't fall outside the <span class="DLF">window</span> anyhow, because the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were barricaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Then he said, and I said to them, "What shall we do?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="330">Stay here and wait until we give you orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And you should know, we never even bent a hair of a Jew, and we won't do it this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But eventually, you will all be exterminated," something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I don't know if they said the exact words. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So we waited, then said, "What should we wait for? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Let's go downstairs." </span><span class="sentence" id="336">That was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We went through the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , and we saw in the big -- there was another <span class="BUILDING">dormitory place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We were on a small side room with lamps hanging down. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They just took their swords, or whatever they had, and cut off the electric lamps that were hanging down. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They cut the faucet so that the water was just coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And they said to us, "Go downstairs." </span><span class="sentence" id="342">There was a non-Jewish janitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And he said to us, "You better get dressed and get ready, because we don't know what's going to happen," because they didn't tell anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Then the caretaker of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> thought it would be good idea to go to the police and tell them what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But that was a joke, because going to the police, they just kept him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He never came back, and probably afterwards was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Then the woman of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> downstairs said, "What I will do," it is 4:00 o'clock in the morning, 4:30, "I will make some coffee for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I will give you something to eat." </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  This was a non-Jewish woman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  Yes, it was a non-Jewish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There was also Jewish woman there, both. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Then we said, "Let's wait and see what's going to happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="354">The people who had come into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , 10, 20 people, left. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And there was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But the non-Jewish janitor said to us, "They will come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And they did come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">About 6:00, 6:30, they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And they told --
QUESTION:  Excuse me, this is the same morning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  This is the same morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">On November 10th, it was a Thursday morning, they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And the Nazis who were not dressed in Nazi uniform, because they wanted the people to believe it's the foixvut (ph), the anger of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And this does not come from the party, but comes from the plain civilian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They were in civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They told us, "Get a little bit together." </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We thought we should pack all of this. "</span><span class="sentence" id="367">No, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">You will come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Of course, it wasn't true, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So we took a few things along, and they said, "All of you assemble in this <span class="NPIP">corner</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And so we assembled in that <span class="NPIP">corner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And then about 7:30 or so, they said to us, "Now let's go and march." </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They marched about three or four, maybe even six in a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We were about -- I don't even remember how many people there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But there were 50, 60 people or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we walked, it's a narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> , through this narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And we walked toward the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> they led us. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And while we were going through the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the populace, the people were standing at the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I think they were all Nazis, because they spit at us, and they threw stones at us and all kinds of -- and they made noise and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We went through the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we passed by the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We saw the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And we went all the way, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where there used to be a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> of the Bavarian king. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We passed by there, and they led us to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And they were -- the Germans were very methodical. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">When you came in, they took a picture of you, on the right side, from the left side, from the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And they took all your money, or all kind of things which you had in your pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And they made a complete record of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">They were very meticulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">They were very orderly in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And they gave it to us, and they said, "Sign here." </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Okay, we signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Then they led us into <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">prison cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I was in prison cell number 99, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And there were about 15 boys in that <span class="INT_SPACE">prison cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They put us in there, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">water cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And there was, like, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bowel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And there were <span class="DLF">windows</span> on top, with iron bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And there was -- I don't think anything else, maybe a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And in the <span class="DLF">door</span> was a little <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And through this <span class="DLF">window</span> they gave us food about an hour later, like water with a few beans in it and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  How long were you in this <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  From that Thursday until the next Thursday, eight days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  It was fairly --
ANSWER:  And we always thought we would all be sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Because every morning and every evening, they took us all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Once a day, they led us around the <span class="DLF">prison yard</span> to give us a prison walk for an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And then they led us all out, and they read a list of names to make sure everyone was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And every day, the number had come less. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And we imagined, because no one told us, that they probably were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And then came the last day of the seven days. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They called us a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They called us a list, and they read all the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Then they read seven names, and I was among the seven whom they read. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And they said to them, "Stay at the side." </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We stayed at the side.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  What were you thinking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  I didn't know what they would do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I think they would send us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But what happened was, all the others were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And these seven, I among them, was stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And they said to us, "You are stateless, and we are going to send you away," not telling us where. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So I thought maybe they send me to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , because my father came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And I said to myself, "It's better to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> than to stay here," even though I didn't know that at that time it was just as bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And I already made up my mind to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="424">Within 24 hours I will be in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="425">That was at noon-time then. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Then they came back in the evening, and they called us again, the seven people. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And they said, "Go downstairs and report to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">prison office</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I know now that all the others were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> because they wanted to empty the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">All people under 15 and over 60 were sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">They only kept the people between 15 and 60, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So when we came downstairs, they told us, "You are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Sign this." </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And they gave us back all the things which they had taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">They were very meticulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And they said, "Return within 24 hours to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home cities</span> , and report to the Gestapo."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  Now, how did this feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I mean, it must have been a fairly strange feeling that you were so close to being sent away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  I didn't -- I felt -- I said, "Whatever is going to happen to us, we cannot do much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We can maybe pray a little bit," and that's what we did while we were together in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="440">But what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We hope for the best, you see, and we know bad things -- bad things are going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We hope that a miracle or something would happen, and things will change for us." </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Well, it was very bad, and nothing helped us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Now, while you must have had a certain immediate relief at not being sent away, what were you thinking about the other people you had spent time with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  We felt very bad about the other people that were sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And we hoped that maybe they wouldn't have to stay there such a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">At that time, they had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but they did not do the killings in such large measures as afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They killed a few people, as I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They sent the urns to those people about -- Jews and non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I even know non-Jews whose urns they had sent away, back to them, to family. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So we thought -- and beside this, when we came out, we knew that Greppels (ph) had called off -- Gurling (ph) had called off the sending away the Jews on the day afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It didn't make much difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I only felt, I only thought that maybe I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I would see what's going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">But for eight days we didn't know what was going on in the world because we were completely separated from any news.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  I'm going to ask you, do you want a glass of water?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  No, thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  I want to talk to you about what happened when you got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">You were from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> ; is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">After I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , I needed to go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I needed money for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I had none. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But as I say before, miracles happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">The miracle happened, I met the secretary of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And I asked her, "Can I have some money?" </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And she gave me 20 marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to find out if any of my belongings were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I met another fellow, and -- but I couldn't find anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">It was all locked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And so I went straight to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And it was late at night, because we came out, it was in winter, November. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It gets dark early. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I came to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> was packed with Nazis and other people at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And I went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> , and I bought a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But during the train trip, I was afraid if they would find out that I'm a Jew, they would beat me up or throw me off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So while I was traveling on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, I was walking always along the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> in order to walk around and not sit at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Because I was afraid of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And I was probably the only Jew there on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">When I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , it was a Friday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">You can figure out, on the 10th, 17th, it was probably the 18th of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I came to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> to where we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And I thought everything was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I tried to call my mother and my parents from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , but there was no answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So I said, "Okay, I walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I will go there myself." </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I walked over. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And when I came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I saw the whole -- all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> that barricaded with wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And the <span class="DLF">side door</span> had a note there, "Get the key from the police department." </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So before I went to the police department, I saw a neighbor of ours on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> who had a <span class="BUILDING">furniture business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And he was really a good friend of ours, non-Jewish person. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Because as I told you, we had mostly non-Jewish neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And this man just went to me with a finger, "Come in, come in." </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He was afraid to say anything or stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He did it from inside the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and he took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And he took me in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> which was farthest away from the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I think it was a safe -- he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">safe</span> , I'm not so sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I don't know whether his wife was there or not, because we were also friends with his wife and his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And he said to me, "I want to tell you what happened on the Kristallnacht." </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They didn't call it the Kristallnacht then. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They called it the progrun (ph). "</span><span class="sentence" id="503">In the middle of the night, these people came," and he mentioned the name of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And they are mentioned in what I showed you, the Heid's (ph) Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  What was the name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Henreiz (ph) was one name, and I don't remember the other name. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But it's in the -- in my records. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And they came the night, and they were standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And they were screaming, they were calling up, "Joe." </span><span class="sentence" id="510">My father's name was Joseph, they call him, Joe, "Open up." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And when my father heard this, he fled. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">He ran over the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and this man told me he went to the <span class="DLF">port</span> , to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , and he boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish ship</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I don't know, probably that's what he told him. "</span><span class="sentence" id="514">And your brother, your younger brother, who was just barmitzvah in October 1939, '38, he went to call a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But he never came back." </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And my sister, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">She was like a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- household help. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And so then he came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">They broke in. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They broke everything, because later on when I came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I saw everything ripped up and pasted and broken down, all glass <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And I had -- it was not easy to get up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And they asked your mother, "Where is your husband?" </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And my mother did not want to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So she said, "I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="525">When she did not tell them, they just shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I don't know how many -- how many times they shot, but at least once, because afterwards I found the bullet there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  That was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  And then he said to me, "What happened afterwards, two ladies came, and they buried her in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And he was afraid to tell me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">That was all he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , which wasn't too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And I asked them for the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">They gave me the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And they told me, "Write down where you are going to be," and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I said, "What do you need to know this for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So they said to me, "We want to know where all the Jews are in all the world, because eventually we will come and we will conquer the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And we will kill all the Jews in the whole world." </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So, "That's what you think." </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I said to myself, "That's what they think, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">But it's not always going this way." </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So I had the key, and I went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I saw everything was broken, and pictures were torn. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And I looked there, and I found a little passbook picture of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Probably she had taken it just before, because we had to send away to the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> so they can get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">That picture I took later on, and I had it remade by some company in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and made a big picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">You saw the picture in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And they wrote a book about this later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And then --
QUESTION:  So your mother was already buried?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">She was not there, because this was already a week after the Kristallnacht when they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the business were wrecked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the business were all torn and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So what should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I said, "To stay here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> is no use, because there is no one there." </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> again, to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and I went to see my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And again, I was afraid, you see, there were Nazis there, all kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So I came to Nazi -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , just about twilight in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And I knew the people where my sister was staying with. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And I went over to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and it was already getting dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So I -- so I came there, and I knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And they were all there, the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And they had about five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And my sister was there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And they were all standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">As you know, the Jewish custom, on Friday evening, they make Kadriche (ph), you see, for Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I came just at that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And I asked them where my father had been, and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I found out that my father was with some other relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He was sitting shiver (ph) at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And my brother had been sent to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And I went there, and I stayed there for the rest of the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And other things happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  I did want to ask you, and I don't want to break up your train of thought here. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But eventually, you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  And you got involved as a representative from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  Intermediary, I guess you termed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about, what your responsibilities were, why you were doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  After a while, after the Kristallnacht, after a while in December, some people came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Some people were released from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Some came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And they wanted again to make some kind of community, and the community took place at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They moved to a different <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , not anymore in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">community house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">They moved to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a private family, Greenberg, which was on <span class="DLF">Kohlhage Strasse</span> (ph), but you don't have to know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Anyhow, it moved to a private house, these people who had already emigrated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , who had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And they had donated this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and afterward 100 or more people were living in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because they made every little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> into, like, a family place. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So that's where we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And one of the people became, so to say, the president or the administrator of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And I was working with them, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I was working with them to prepare for emigration, misheighers (ph) is the translation. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I even went to small <span class="NPIP">places</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremenhoffen</span> (ph), and Weizamenda (ph) in certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And the Gestapo wanted to know everything that the congregation is doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So I was appointed, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I don't know if I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Maybe I did volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But I think I was appointed to go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So I went two, three times a week, and sometimes more. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And then they wanted to know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The first time when I went there, they showed me a bunch of papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And he said to me, "These are the things which we found in your <span class="BUILDING">parents' home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I don't know if they ever gave it back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But they just showed it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">They wanted to show they are honest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They keep people's things and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And then I asked him, I asked him, "Where is my brother?" </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So my brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But somehow, through circumstances which I don't know, he was released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and sent to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So my father and I, we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">My sister was -- remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and my other brother was in the <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> , as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And we were living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Everything was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , we were sleeping there. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And many nights, there was a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Especially one night, I remember a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And I saw people in civilian uniforms, standing on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And they called again, "Open up." </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I said to them, I said to them, "Okay, I will open up." </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So I opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And they came in, and they were looking all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So I said, "What are you looking for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They said to me, "We are looking for your brother." </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And I said, "My brother is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But they didn't believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They looked all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">They looked under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> , and over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> , and in all corners. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So they came all within the middle of the night, as if they didn't know it, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Conclusion of Interview </span>
