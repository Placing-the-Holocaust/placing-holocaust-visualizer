QUESTION:  Was your name Henny Fletcher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name was Henny Fletcher, and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , in 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  The date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  November 25, 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Well, are you already recording me? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I had a younger brother, who was three years younger than I was, and I suppose we could be considered an upper middle class family, because we had a lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my brother and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> which was a rarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Basically, I was not lacking in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I was pretty happy go lucky young kid, and we were both growing up like average two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We used to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the summer time, and in the winter time, I used to spend my days after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on the <span class="DLF">ice skating rink</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macobie</span> (ph) because I like gymnastics. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And my brother was a nuisance, like all the other little brothers who were always in the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I cannot tell you that I had any difficulty growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What was your father's business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  My father was a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He was actually in <span class="BUILDING">manufacturing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He didn't, he people who did it for him, educational toys, like chess, dominoes and all the other ones and also children's games. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The highlight of my life was in December, my father used to deliver all the -- have the orders delivered to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> on our main <span class="DLF">street</span> , which is the equivalent of <span class="DLF">Park Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , which , and all these <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were <span class="BUILDING">Gentile stores</span> mostly, and I was the one who used to deliver all these packaged orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I had friends of mine who were looking forward every year in December to accompany me because my father used to hire a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> with two horses and a driver, not a driver actually, whatever you call him, and he used to put all the boxes in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> and put my friend, the one which I picked, and me in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> cover with a heavy fur cover, and then we used to stop near every <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I used to walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He used to deliver the box. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I used to say I am Fletcher's daughter in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and they used to give me the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was the highlight of me and my friends period usually before Christmas time. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I had an exceptional father, really, because he had tremendous confidence in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He just thought at the age of 10 or 11 that I could do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I remember when I was 11 years old, he called me into his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and he opened up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk drawer</span> , on the right side, second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> , and he showed me a bank book and there was money in there, written down how much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I said to him, "what's that for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He said, "that's for you, for your dowry." </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I said to him, "dowry, you're not going to pay anybody to marry me." </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was so furious then. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">As I said, he instilled in me tremendous confidence, self confidence, and I think that helped me a lot during the war and after the war because he was a great optimist. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He was a very funny man. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He always had interesting jokes and interesting stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He also designed calendars -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> -- I don't know Lithuania-- but every single day you tore off a page. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I think they have it here, too, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And on the back of the page of each day there was a joke, and my father was the one who wrote all the jokes on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> of each day. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So, I grew up in a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> with almost like a funny man and he always made life very happy and amusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Were you close with your mother, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I had a wonderful mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She was the opposite, very quiet, very refined lady who always looked for me to help out, but I was never around because I was busy, as I said, having fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But she had help, but she was a lovely lady, unassuming and very gentle and very kind and I loved her very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She was a very pretty lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I remember on high holidays she used to get dressed up always in a grey wool suit with a silver fox fur for not a collar, but it was called a shawl. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And she was blond, and every year she used to go to the women who used to make hats and the hat was always open on top so her blond hair would show and an large, large brim. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And whenever she used to walk in the <span class="BUILDING">synagog</span> for the high holidays, people looked at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">She was tall and a very nice lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Were you religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Well of course we were kosher in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I wouldn't say we were ultra religious, but we were kosher at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we celebrated the high holidays and Hanukkah and Passover and traditional, I would call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Then, of course, when the Russians came into <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , we were kind of on pins and needles, because my father was a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He was afraid they were going to send us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So, he started planning on how we should get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It wasn't easy, actually, for people who are more or less established to just throw away everything and pick up the family and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">That was in 1939, and at that time, we had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and one time they sent us a letter asking us to help them, because they had this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They were store keepers and one day the Germans came in -- that was written in the letter -- the Germans came in, took away the head of the family from the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and told the wife, he's going to be back in a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We just want to interrogate him. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The next day, two days later, they came back with a little box, which in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> peppercorns came in little boxes, and they came back and handed her the box, put it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> and said, "this is your husband." </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So, this was the letter we received in '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And of course, my parents tried to help them to leave, and they did arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , but is didn't sound real. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It just didn't sound that people could do that to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, my mother definitely felt that something was wrong with her, but my father kind of believed it because there were quite a number of Polish Jews who kept on running away at that time from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, he started somehow plotting things out how to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So, the first thing he did, which he wasn't silly, but he went to to see his family because he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I'm just digressing because I just wanted to show you what a great man he was in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He wasn't actually, he wasn't demonstrative, but he was exceptionally supportive of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I don't know, but he really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Before the Russians came in, I had a beautiful coat made for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was grey wool, fur collar, a trench coat with a belt, very sharp. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So, my father took the coat and said he was going to see his family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , and he came back and the lining of the coat was removed and behind the lining was all mink -- filled in with mink. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He felt that in case something 1s going to happen to him, I should have something to fall back on, to sell the coat or sell the mink for my mother and my brother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That is the kind of family I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I really and truly feel personally that I cannot, how should I say it, I could not let this four years, or actually three years, actually horrible three years, ruin my life, ruin me for the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was a period where actually the world went mad, and I happened to be caught in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It could have happened to anybody who was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That to destroy the rest of my life and to feed my children with experiences of madmen after the war and live in the past, I couldn't do that, because my upbringing was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a little bit more about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Was it a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> to grow up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Yes, I had no difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I mean, were there things to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">There was this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we went to, they had all kind of functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And then of course in the winter time we had the ice skating rinks with the music, and we used to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and play and dance and do all these wild things, which were wild then. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Then I belonged to Macabe, which is an organization, which is a sport organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I used to spend my days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I was the ping pong champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And in the summer we went to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where I used to hike. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I really, maybe I never encountered any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I was always exposed to Jewish people, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , except for the people who were dealing with my father, who were exceptionally nice, too, because apparently they needed his product.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  So you didn't have any difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  I really didn't, but it turned out worse with the Germans, eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  You had a nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Did it ever occur to you that that would be taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Not only did it never occur me, but even when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I always expected to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I really attributed it to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I'm serious, because in retrospect, I mean I thought about it before you came. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He really instilled in me a tremendous amount of self assurance and confidence, and if you just do your thing, you'll make it if you want it badly enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Now, you were mentioning that you were starting to get concerned after the Russians came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  What sorts of opportunities were taken away from you at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">How did your life change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  You mean to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  No, just in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> when the Russians were there, were certain things prohibited to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Could you continue to practice your religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Did you still go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Was everything basically the same, or did it change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well, the first thing that changed was the Russians had a theory that they had to relocate the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Never to leave the same people in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, what they did, the first thing they did was to move me from my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I didn't know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I did know some, but -- and the people from the other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were moved to my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So, they kind of mixed the whole thing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And, they also, of course introduced all Russian history and Russian, and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I wouldn't say -- the only problem as far as I recall is that we were fearful that any day they'll come and just take us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> because everybody around us, whoever was in business, that's where they wound up. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> used to come, just like the Germans actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They had the same system. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Without warning, they used to knock at your <span class="DLF">door</span> and say, "Come, take whatever you can just take with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Put you on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , put you on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">a train</span> , and send you to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So, that was our only fear at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Did you know people that were going to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , did you know where they were going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Well, they knew, they knew that's what the Russians are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They did have some inclination of what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The people, especially who are in business, who are employing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So, that was the only fear which I recall my father had. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But, otherwise, and as I said, I got used to being in the new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I kept on doing my own thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Did you continue to practice Jewish holidays and all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  I don't really recall, because we were not that religious that it affected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Probably the people who were religious it affected them. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But I don't recall going to <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> that year for all the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That's something that is kind of murky in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first day of the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Yes, I do, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It was 1941, June 21, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">That was a day that I was supposed to go to my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my original <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to pick up my diploma because I had graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I had a pair of silk stockings, which I kept for that special occasion, to put on a pair of silk stockings. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I walked to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was quite a distance, and I picked up my diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was all rolled up with a ribbon, and I walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and as I passed where the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> lived, suddenly something fell out from an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , because they bombed the <span class="INT_SPACE">President's quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I fell on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I got up. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I wasn't really concerned about the bomb more than that I tore my stockings. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we knew something was going to happen because we really -- in spite of the fact that we did not want to believe that the Germans are going to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and we hoped that it would just pass us by, we knew that they are there and we had no choice at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We were already caught between the devil and the .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Can you describe the atmosphere in the <span class="DLF">street</span> at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  It was chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It was very, very chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It's very difficult to describe the chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">People really didn't know what to do, because they were trapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We were really just trapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We didn't have weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We didn't have anybody on our side. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It wasn't only the Germans that were against us, it was actually the Lithuanians started before the Germans started. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, they started looting and screaming and yelling and beating us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So, we didn't know which way to turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  You saw this and this was just all around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Oh, all around us, all around us, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We kept our <span class="DLF">door</span> locked, and we were lucky that they must have got enough from the people around so they didn't manage to break down our <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They were terrible, unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was such like, like I said, I never had any contact with them before, but they turned like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was just neighbors, people who you dealt with. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They suddenly -- it was almost like they waited for it, like hungry dogs and so it was rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was really rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You know, I read a book by an author by the name of Bothenheimer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He's a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I'm just telling you a little story about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I belong to a study group, and in the book it described about a bunch of Jews who believed they were being taken by the Germans to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and that eventually they would be staying there until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I was the only survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The rest of the people in the group were Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And after reading the book the discussion was going on, how stupid could you be. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Couldn't you just stand up against the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Couldn't you just stand up against the Lithuanians? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">There were so many and there were only three or four soldiers around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I was absolutely furious, because it wasn't a matter that we were weak, or that we were like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">How can you just protect yourself against a bunch of mad dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You just can't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I mean people did it, and they were immediately killed in front of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So you just hoped against hopes that you will make it without making any waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Now, in the first few days after the bombs were dropped and the Lithuanians were running around beating people, can you describe what else was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Not really, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Just trying to figure out what's going to be next, and we were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We wouldn't dare walk out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until they came around with those loud speakers directing us what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But we packed. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We packed mostly silver and mostly valuable things because, you know, in spite of the fact that we hadn't experienced things like that since almost 1924, for I'd say almost 20 years or so, or less than that, we lived a relative normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Really, a normal life, but when something happens to you you kind of know it's the survival of the fittest. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You kind of know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And you start thinking, you don't need a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> , you don't need extra clothes, you need something that you can trade eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So, we took the silver and some of the jewelry, which my mother had and every upper middle class family had something, because there was no stainless steel and there was no other kind of this stuff which is sold here now, so whatever you had was kind of silver or gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">It was not synthetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And we knew that the farmers <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> will be glad to acquire it, to exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Not that we ever experienced it before, but like I said, it's something that you just know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Now, I know a lot of people were herded up, right away taken outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Was this something that you were aware of at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  No, no I found out later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Like I said, we were just lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact with the Jewish part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> (ph), at this point, or were you separated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We did not live -- we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Actually we lived behind the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">There was the front of the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> and behind was the <span class="INT_SPACE">interior</span> where they had <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We lived in one of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> behind the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So, maybe that's why, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe they just didn't want to destroy the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They thought maybe the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> not too many Jews live. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I don't know, but we were not bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We just waited to hear what the next step would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  It was several weeks, and then did you have to move from where you were living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Then we were told that we had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> because they were going to have a separate <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">All they kept on yelling was and we took whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Now, I don't remember how we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I totally forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I mean I remember so many details, but this is one thing that I just do not remember how we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I know we didn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It was quite a distance, and I know that we had quite a lot of stuff by the time we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , so maybe Father arranged -- I can't really- it's blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">All I know is that we wound up in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was called at that time the Small Ghetto and which was actually this is where most of the Jews were brought in that particular part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And then after a short period of time, they started coming in and asking for silver and whatever you have, all your valuables, the ones who brought there, and I remember my parents handing over a box of something with stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They saved some of the other ones and then after that there was the big which was called, they decided to shrink, that was their method to shrink up the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and we were told to come out on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , four in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Actually eight in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We started out, and my best friend and her brother and her father and mother were in the same row with the four of us, and they were the other four. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And they said, everybody eight in a row and just walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And the Germans, young, absolutely young faces, must be 18 or 19, inconceivable how you can motivate young people to be so cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">They just walked and they separated in half, four and four, and they send my friend and her family on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and my father and mother and brother on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It turned out that her <span class="NPIP">side</span> was the bad <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and these people from that particular <span class="NPIP">side</span> never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They were taken and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Now, all I can contribute it to is luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">She certainly -- I wasn't certainly better than she was and her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We were both the same people and so, I'm here probably because I was just lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So, when they shrunk it, when they eliminated almost half of the population, we had to move to another <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  This was when, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  This was only 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">It was quite early.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Soon after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was formed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, because at the same time they also called out, they asked for 500 people who are, I mean, personalties, who speak German, who are educated, who are so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They had names and these people who were actually dealing with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for years, my father almost went because he represented a Germany company too in 1932, and who were professional people. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They all went, hoping that they would be able to do something to negotiate with the Germans or influence them. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They were called out, and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">This was known as the 500, the top, the cream really of the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So, that was all in the same period of time, and they were trying somehow, in retrospect that's the only way I can understand, to kind of shrink the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Now this action that you were talking about where 500 people were taken away, this was in the beginning days of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">My uncle actually was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He was taken away, and his wife and a child lived with us in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about when you lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Who was with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Well, we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">My brother and my mother and my father and my aunt, who's husband was taken away with the first 500, and her child , who was five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">My father worked for the guild it was called, and I went in the morning to the <span class="REGION">area</span> where they set up people to go to work, and I used to get up in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">My mother used to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my brother was younger, so he also stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a short period of time with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I used to get up and go out to, what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It was a large <span class="REGION">area</span> where everybody got together near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and there there were leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The Germans needed people, and it was like groups that they took them outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> to do some labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I was lucky enough to fall into the group where my husband was heading that particular group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  You mean you met him? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He wasn't your husband then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  No, of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I was standing there, actually I was standing there 1n the group, and he had a group of men, and he said he needed a secretary, and he asked me to join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So, I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So, I was working in his group. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">What I was doing at that time, I wasn't doing secretarial work. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I was working at an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They were building the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and we had to carry wood and drag things and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But, it was not too difficult because eventually I helped him to other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Like what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Well, the Germans, they were kind of decent, and they said if you will accomplish your, what do you call it, if you'll accomplish what you're supposed to do, your quota, you will be able to get some extra flour from the farmers around. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So, that is what everybody worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Whether you do or you don't, you don't get anything, but here you are told what you will be getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We certainly were very conscientious. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So, we got flour, and what I had to do, I had to divide and kind of weigh the flour and divide the portions to every single person. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But, I was so generous that a few times there was none left for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, my husband told me, at that time he wasn't my husband, he said don't be so generous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  You were also doing the heavy manual labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But this is once in a while that they wanted to be kind they would say, yes, but I was working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  What other kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">work brigades</span> were you on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  That's the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I was waiting most of the time, and then, of course, I was taken to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The Germans needed, for what reason I don't know, a group of young women to take on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> to apparently pick vegetables or plant vegetables on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They dragged me out of this group, and we found ourselves on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I got up in the morning and walked out on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and a German came galloping on a horse, a nice big horse with a saddle, and he looked at all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We were about 18, 20 women approximately and he picked me and he said to me "Have you ever ridden a horse?" </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He said, "Good, it's time to learn." </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So he got off the horse, and he removed the saddle, and he made me get up on the horse, and he must have talked to the horse or did something to him because the horse started running like a madman, and I thought to myself, you're not going to lose me off that horse, and I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Then I finally came down, he said, "Now you learn, now you can pick vegetables." </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So, I was there for a couple of days, and then I was lucky enough, because I don't think they came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Why did he ask you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  It was fun for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I mean, can you imagine a young woman going on a bare back horse who has never ridden a horse, and a wild one. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">You know what it means to holding onto the horse, not to fall off and break your neck, because that was what he was probably hoping. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Who knows, they were mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They were creatures from <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They were absolutely mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I don't think they looked at us as humans and that was exactly what I decided at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They didn't look at us as humans. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I never looked at them as humans, and I'll just try plain and simple to survive because you couldn't look them in the eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I know a young woman looked them in the eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They slapped her to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They couldn't touch us, thank goodness, because they were told they would be poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Otherwise they would have raped every single one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We were 18 year old kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">That's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They did all kind of things for recreation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit more of what life was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Well, life went on when it was quiet, kind of normal in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We met, we kissed, we drank, we had fun when we had the opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The young ones, we really tried to live as normal a life as you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">You're talking about people who are 18 or 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We have no responsibilities, we have no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We have no family. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now, my mother had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I mean she just, as a matter of fact, her brother was killed, and then they had the children here, and they made my aunt take her child to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">She saw her child being killed, being put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and I think -- I don't know, I heard gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">When my aunt came back, she was mad for a short period of time, and my mother had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But she survived, and she was pretty good and that's thanks to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He really came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He was three years younger than I was, but he was a very smart determined young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">First of all, he was tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He was blond and didn't look Jewish at all and that was in his favor because every time he used to go to work, he used to just leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and go to Lithuanians, whom he knew, and traded some silver or whatever my mother gave him. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">My mother used to give him a piece of silverware at a time so they would wait for the next piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He really supported the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">When my mother had her stroke, I was married then already, so when my mother had the stroke, he was really there for her, and he brought her everything, and he brought her to the point where she could walk and talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, you ask me how was life, if you asked me or all my friends, it's different. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Because you know youth, we'll overcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You cannot help it, so we'll do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It's careless, I don't think 1t was an adventure because it was probably miserable because this one is gone and that one is gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The whole thing was kind of scary, and the guys also, they are afraid they were going to die tomorrow, let's have fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">For young people it was bad, but not as bad as for my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  Were there cultural activities, political activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">No cultural activities, no political activities, you just try to live from day to day and work, and if you have a chance to have some fun, get married because you were safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I think we got married after that incident on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> because I wouldn't say it was safer to be married. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I mean, I liked my husband and he liked me and he asked my father for my hand and my father said by all means if anybody will take care of you, he's the one who will, and my father was absolutely right. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So, we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Not that it mattered much eventually, because they separated us eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But everybody felt that if you were married you were kind of safer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Did you move in with his family or he came where you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We got married on a Saturday, must have been because we worked on Friday, and I moved in -- actually I couldn't move in right away with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">His family consisted of his mother, a brother and a sister-in-law, and they lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">His mother was in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I remember an iron <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">She was a semi-invalid. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">She had arthritis, a very bad case. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">She was 1n <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">My husband used to sleep on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> , and then my brother-in-law and sister-in-law slept in the corner on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">When we decided to get married, my husband decided to build a second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , above my brother-in-law's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He built a very good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">He even cut in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> a step for me to get up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So, it took him a while to build it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So, eventually I moved in with my husband in the <span class="INT_SPACE">upper deck</span> , and he built a little shelf so I could bring my dowry with me, which my mother gave me before I left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">She gave me about a pound of hard sugar, which was very valuable, more so than diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I don't know how she kept it or where she kept it, and I brought my dowry up there on the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  You had mentioned a little while ago, about the Small Ghetto being liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">That's where you were living at the time, wasn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  When?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  When did you first move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  Actually first we moved -- it wasn't the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> , it was where everybody was. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I don't know if it was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Eventually they eliminated one and maybe the second one was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Are you talking before the liquidation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">In the beginning you said you were moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> , and even in the beginning, as I understand it, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was in two parts joined by a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> or something, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">There was no <span class="DLF">bridge</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Well, I don't know, there was some sort of <span class="DLF">street</span> , but there were two parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Yes, right, you're right, there were two parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I must have been in the small one originally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  The one that they got rid of?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I heard something about it, but I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">This is when they liquidated the small one, and they separated my friend and her family from us, and we wound up in the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Okay, then I won't ask you about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  Because, you know, I remember it vaguely, but I really can't contribute much to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I do know many people disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  All of a sudden a third of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> is gone?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  When was that, can you tell me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  This was the most horrendous time. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It must have been in 19-- we got married in 1943, in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It must have been in the beginning of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">It was -- I don't know the exact date, which is immaterial really. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I wasn't working at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I was off that day, and my brother-in-law, my husband's brother was also <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So, the two of us were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my husband's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Suddenly the loud speaker started screaming all the people and children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And my mother-in-law, as I said was a semi-invalid, a wonderful woman, an exceptional lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">She used to teach me how to make gourmet dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">She was a fabulous cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">She was a pharmacist by education, a wonderful lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We knew she could not walk, so I looked at my brother-in-law, and he looked at me, and I said, let's hide her someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But before we had a chance to do anything, they just broke into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">As I told you, we were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , all five us, and they said out to her from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I stood in front of her and I said, "She can't walk." </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So they gave me a Slap. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">She can't walk, so carry her. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So I said to Miska, my brother-in-law, let's put something on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">She was wearing a nightgown. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Anyway, they wouldn't let us do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They made my brother-in-law grab her by the shoulders, and I had to grab her by the foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I tried to pull down her dress-- it would break my husband's heart-- her nightgown, and we carried her out and the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a nightmare because all you could see were young people carrying these old people like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And we carried her to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> were stationed, and he told my brother-in-law -- they are so young, it is unbelievable, the milk was still on their lips -- to stay, and I'm the one who should carry her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Now, she was a frail woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I must have picked her up, and I walked up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and I figured that's the end of me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , so I had to put her in the <span class="DLF">aisle</span> , and I covered her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They looked around to find a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So, they pushed me down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and said, "you get out of there." </span><span class="sentence" id="431">That was my memory of this particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I think this 1s when they took them to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  You had a little brother at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">What happened to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  He wasn't so little anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">You grow up awfully quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">He must have been 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">He was an organizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He kind of supported the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Immediately after I got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and I started running, because I was hysterical, because I was sure that my mother was gone also. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So, I ran back to my <span class="BUILDING">mother's home</span> , and there's my mother sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> with makeup. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I don't know where by brother found makeup. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">She was 39 years old, my mother, or 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">My father was completely beside himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">My father got lost in himself rather, so my brother who is the one who fixed up her hair and put makeup on her and told her to sit in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and don't move and smile. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So, when the Germans came in, she was young, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">She didn't get up, she didn't blink, so they just let her be this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">What happened to him, was when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno Ghetto</span> was liquidated, we all were taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and he walked out from the march, he removed his yellow sign, and apparently he had friends, we knew he had friends, because he kept on dealing with them, but he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">We don't know if a Lithuanian saw him walking out and immediately arrested him and some of his so called friends, but we never heard from him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">That was the end of my brother.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  You know, I used to get up in the morning and go to work and then used to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">How much more brutal can it be what they did having to drag their mothers or fathers or children burning in front of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I mean I didn't see it every day of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I don't think I'd be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I'd be mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I mean you can get hardened up to a point. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">They used to beat up people. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It became, they beat you if they didn't like your face, they used to slap you and hit you. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They needed us because we were laborers, especially the young ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And of the old ones, they just periodically got rid of. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The only brutality which was cruel is out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> when we wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the political organization of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I mean, how were things run? </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Who was running it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  That then you really knew you had to do something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  That's right, but we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We tried -- there was nothing we could do because the people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> were not willing to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So, as I said, we were cornered. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We couldn't do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The underground -- there were all kinds of rumors going around. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We just hoped that the Russians were going to come back soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I mean on the radios they kept on saying the Germans are running for their lives, and they were already by then, so we were hoping they were just going to leave us alone while they were going to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But they decided to take us with them, and that is when the two of us decided maybe we should build a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> for the two us, because the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> which some of the people built, were sophisticated <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> which were under the ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It took them quite a while to dig. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">When we came to ask if they would let us in, they said it was filled up. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">There 1s no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So, we decided to do something on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So we decided to dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> for ourselves because they kept on saying the Russians are at our <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They are going to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> any day. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So, the two of us worked through the night, and we dug a nice <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and we put a large pitcher of water and some crackers, and we made a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> for ourselves down there, and we covered up the <span class="DLF">hole</span> with a green pillow to make sure it kind of blends in with the landscaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And then the next day or two days later, the Germans were rounding up the Jews to take them -- don't worry, wherever we take you 1s going to be better than here. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So, we got into our <span class="DLF">hole</span> , and we covered it very gingerly. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We put the pillow on top of it to make sure that some of the leaves and branches could cover the pillow. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We sat down, the two of us, and we figured we would last for a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">There was enough <span class="DLF">air</span> and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">The next thing we heard were people walking, making noise, Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They yelled, "look here, look there, there must be somebody here because there is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it looks like the <span class="DLF">door</span> is open." </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And suddenly we had a boot coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">One of the Germans stepped their foot on the pillow, and they started screaming, "come on out of there," and suddenly a rifle was put into the <span class="DLF">hole</span> , and I came out absolutely muddy, dirty, and my husband came out absolutely muddy dirty, and luckily I have to say they were Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Not that they are much -- not that I understand, I'm not sure, but one of them was an older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He must have been 40, he said, "how many more are there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I said, "just the two of us." </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He became hysterical, it struck him so funny. "</span><span class="sentence" id="519">Why should you want to stay here and be dirty and filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Go get washed and we'll take you to a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="521">That is how we were actually saved, because when the Germans left, they completely destroyed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> by fire and by bombing it and by all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So, the people who were in the sophisticated <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , they choked to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We definitely wouldn't have made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
ANSWER:  When you work outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , you have an opportunity to bring in some more food, because the food was limited in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So, therefore, one of us, when I didn't want to work , | didn't have access to anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Do you remember there being any kind of qualitative change when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">How that came about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  Excuse me, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> did not become a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  I thought that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> they enclosed, and they called it an official <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> a little bit later on before the liquidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Pardon, before what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  In November of '43?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  No, they called it an official concentration -- who called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  I don't know, the history books, the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We refer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but basically it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Here we just lived in our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We had <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , despite of the fact that they came around every so often to eliminate a number of population. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , we were completely under their mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">You lived in their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">You got up in the morning, and you were given a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> with some sort of a spoon, and you got a cup of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So, it could be called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I don't recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  So, were there any other events that really strike you while you were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">This was the worst that could happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Towards the end, when they were trying to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , I guess, what happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  Like I said, this is when we hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , and they took us to where everybody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">That is where I met my mother, and father and brother, because they were already in that large <span class="REGION">area</span> where they were going to take everybody to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  Where was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> there was a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which it, how should I call it -- they gathered everybody up there, and after they emptied out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , they went from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , told everybody to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were full of people, I mean the handful of people that were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I don't know numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And we all went except for us, the two us. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We were the last, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Most of the people were gathered up already for the last two days while we were busy trying to save ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So, there was a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and that is where they distributed old people in separate <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , groups of them, and then took them <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And then my husband and I, the two of us, were brought to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Lucky enough, I found my mother and father, and Ralph found his brother and sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So, we all stuck together, and then the Germans -- it was like a parade -- they opened up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and said "Now walk." </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And we walked out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> where they took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because the Russians were chasing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Did you take anything with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Yes, that is what I wanted to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Yes, you could take something with you, and I had my coat which my father -- I had my coat with me which my father made for me, I mean filled the lining up with mink skins. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And we walked through the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and as my brother walked out, removed his sign, his yellow star, and walked out and disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And eventually we came to these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , all of us, the whole family, and they brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  Before we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , I want to understand a little bit what the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was like, how many people were on it what that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  There were many people, like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Everybody was pushed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">One woman was mad there. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">She was outrageous. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And of course, everybody eliminated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">It was very very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">It was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">How can I describe it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I was wearing my warm coat, wouldn't let go of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And as we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , they told the women to get out, and they said we don't need you. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">You'll meet up with your husbands and fathers later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So, my sister-in-law, the two of us got of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I think, I'm not sure if they had transportation -- I think they had open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> where we were piled in, and we were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And then we were told, of course, right away my coat was taken way, and whatever else I had, which was very little, I suppose, because I didn't have a chance to take anything with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I held on to my mother, and then they told us to disrobe. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">You know, they had all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and young Germans sitting behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And they said to us, "Okay, go into this large <span class="REGION">area</span> and disrobe." </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I mean by disrobe take everything off. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So, here I am next to my mother, hundreds of women, and we had to be totally naked coming in in front of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> with a bunch of young hoodlums. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So, what do you think in a case like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They are creatures from another <span class="NPIP">planet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">There was no <span class="NPIP">planet</span> then, but creatures from <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Why should I bother worrying about them, whether they look at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">How demeaning can you even feel standing with your mother and relatives and families --my sister-in-law -- and here you're standing totally naked, and they look at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So, I just stood there, and they just looked at us, and they told us to go in the back to take <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and they gave us the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and this is how our ordeal started. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">This 1s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Then they put us in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> which you have in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , it's exactly how the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has it, in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and I don't know how long I was there, but it was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">It was totally terrible, because mothers were taking the food of their children, not children, there were no small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Daughters were eating up the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I mean people were destroying each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">That was actually their idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Whoever was weak and who could not overcome really were taking advantage of their own kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Anyway, I was holding on to my mother as long as I could, and then one day they told us to come out in one of those <span class="REGION">areas</span> which is similar to fairground, except there was no fair, for them it must have been a fair, and they did the same kind of system. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We were walking, and I was holding onto my mother, and she walked pretty well, and she looked pretty good, and they took her away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">They pushed me on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and they pulled my mother on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I ran to my mother, and I was beat up pretty badly, and I was pushed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">That's the last I saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Then we were put into open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , my sister-in-law and myself, and we were taken to some sort of a --
QUESTION:  I need you to say that sentence again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  We were put into open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , always open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">This is why for the life of me I cannot understand how everybody around there didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They always saw us. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The farmers around us, the people around us, they always saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And the Germans were showing off or whatever, and they were taking us to an <span class="REGION">area</span> where they divided us into groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And there I was with my sister-in-law, and a very young woman about my age, walked over to me and she said, "Do you mind if I join you because everybody was taken away from me." </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I said sure, why don't you join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And then about after a half an hour or so, because we had to wait to be distributed wherever they were going to send us, two other woman came over, both of them actually were nurses, a little bit older. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And they said," You look like three nice woman, do you think we can join your group so we can stick together." </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So, we spent the rest of our time together actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So, then they put us again in one of these open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and took us to work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , to build ditches for -- what do you call those things -- I can't think of the name at the moment, but it will come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So what they did is they housed us in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , in regular <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , as you see here. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">They housed about 50 women, and in the middle of the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , one of those wood burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> , and they gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> on straw which this is -- so the five of us plopped down together in one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> , and we stuck together the five of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Where were they from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  All of them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> , and we really stuck together, really stuck it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  Were most of the other prisoners from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Lithuania</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">This was -- you see we were the last ones to be taken out of <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , so basically <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">political concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So, probably it was just so late in the game that they didn't take us any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So there were some gentiles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So, we were taken there in one of the <span class="REGION">areas</span> , which was kind of in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , it was mostly in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , where we were digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> -- <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , that 1s what it is, <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We dug very deep <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , and that is really where the labor was hard, because they stood over you and made sure that you don't even take a breather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION:  And if you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">ANSWER:  Oh, they hit you. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">They really hit you without any mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Were you hit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  I was never hit, because I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I told you I just decided at one time, especially when I was standing there naked, that these are devils from some <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I'm going to look at them as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So, this was my -- I brainwashed myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I figured they are not going to bring me down to their level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  So you didn't stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> that long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Stutthof, I think they kept -- I was there I would say about three days, approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">It wasn't long, or maybe a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I mean time -- I cannot tell you time. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was one thing I didn't think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But it wasn't long, because I didn't work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We didn't work there, but the rumors were that they were going to sterilize us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And we were lucky to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Unfortunately, I couldn't get my mother out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  Were there any children there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  No, but they wanted to sterilize us, because you know women, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I mean, we didn't have our period. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Thank God there was something in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , somebody was watching over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">We didn't for two years, but the rumors were flying around that they were going to sterilize all the young women. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So, when we finally got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , got up every morning and got our soup and went to work, and we dug those deep <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , and then it was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And it was cold, and I used to break up the ice when I went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">There was a break once in a while, and get into the ice and wash myself because the biggest killer almost, and demoralizer, was the filth. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">The filth, the stench and the lice, and the five of us decided we were going to try to eliminate it by hook or by crook, because the people around us were unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Especially older people, also many young ones that gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They just didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">That was the biggest destruction, the filth, and this 1s what we -- two things we promised ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We were going to keep our feet covered, and winter was coming, and the snow and as soon as you got sick this was the end of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">They did not tolerate anybody being sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So, they watched how to kind of decrease the population there. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So, when somebody woke up sick, if you went to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> , chances are you'd never come back, or if you were too filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">We decided we are going to keep clean, and we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  How?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  As I said, we broke up ice, got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and washed ourselves, and at night we used to dry our underwear on the pipe of the woodburning little thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I think we were the only ones who did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And then, I was the brave one, I used to run out in the middle of the night, when the soldiers were kind of resting or not expecting any kind of movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I used to run out to -- if we were -- we were continuously being moved from one <span class="REGION">area</span> to another because we finished one to dig those <span class="DLF">trenches</span> in another <span class="REGION">area</span> , then we were moved to another <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And you could see <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> not too far away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I used to run out and go to the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">They used to give me some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">At first I used to fill myself up with as much food as I possibly could, and then they used to give us loaves of bread, and I used to bring the bread to my four buddies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  You could just sneak out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">ANSWER:  You couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , but it was a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">There was a large <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , a very primitive kind of a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> and around they had the very primitive kind of wires, which they were not concerned about anybody going to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Where would you run, 50 women or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  And the guards were sleeping?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  It was -- they could have shot me, I'm sure, but as I said, I was a little bit of a daredevil I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I didn't do it too often, but I tried it quite a few times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  And the farmers were--?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">They give you a piece of bread and tell you get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They were terrified you shouldn't stay long, that you shouldn't be caught--they shouldn't be caught, not I shouldn't be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But they knew, they knew they were willing to give you bread and feed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I never had any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I stopped quite a number of them, maybe four.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  They knew what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  Of course they knew what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">You had to be absolutely blind or live someplace, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  Who were your guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  Pardon? </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Q; Where were your guards from, what nationality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">ANSWER:  Oh my God, Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">You never talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You didn't even look them in the eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">You look them in the eye you get beat up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  Did you have a like a block elder or somebody just in charge of your <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  You didn't have that much --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  No, no because we were mobile. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They kept on moving us. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We just kept our nose clean and worked, and that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So the only time I was beat up was when I wanted my mother back. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">After that, I just figured I'm not going to mess around with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I'm going to try to stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And then the end came when they decided to take us on the "death march." </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And they knew, rumors started flying around that the Germans are retreating. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">The Russians are going to destroy them, so they decided to take us with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">To this day, I cannot understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I would really like to know what their -- they didn't have any reason for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They just did what they were told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Did you know that's why they were moving you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  Of course, absolutely we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And we started the "death march", it's called now. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It wasn't called then, because we didn't even think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And they started taking us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We stopped in a <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> at every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and they kept on losing people on the way, especially people who didn't have shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And I happened to have a good pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Before, this was the most terrible experience of my life -- one of the most terrible experiences of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Before we were taken on this death march, they delivered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Somehow, luckily some German threw me a pair of good shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I don't know if he meant me or he meant somebody else, but I grabbed it, and I had a good pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And I could see people that we lose are the ones who freeze their feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">It was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">It was in March or February, February I think, the end of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And we kept on losing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">We came to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">In the morning they used to wake us up, and we walked again. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , the names that I happen to have, and one day one of the women who were part of my group said to me, "Why don't I try to go out and see," -- it was after the third <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- "to see if I can get some bread for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">You always are the one who has been supplying us with some extra food. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Let me try, except my shoes are very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Why don't you lend me your shoes and I'll leave you mine," which were smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">She had a smaller foot that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">She left. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">She never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And I got up in the morning when I had to leave, and I looked at her shoes and I said, I'm not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And my friends say yes you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And I said I'm not going to die like a dog on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Let them shoot me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I'm just not going because I knew this was going to be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">You don't walk out barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Now, I just want to tell you about human nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">In the one of the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> where we were, there was a woman who was a loud mouth and a very disliked person, but she always seemed to be able to get more than anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">One of those, you know, and everybody kind of stayed away from her because she yelled at everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">She was rude, she was common -- I don't even want to call her that. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">She was a very disliked individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And I'm standing there with my three buddies, and I said to them I'm not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">She appears from no <span class="NPIP">where</span> , and she said to me, "I have a pair of shoes for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I have an extra pair for myself." </span><span class="sentence" id="753">She handed me a pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">She saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I don't know what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I've been looking for her for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I never spoke to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I never exchanged a word with her through the months that we worked together. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">But she saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I put on my shoes, and I kept on walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Eventually we wound up in the , which was the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of this "death march." </span><span class="sentence" id="762">By then they knew, the Germans knew that they had lost the war and that the Russians were on their tail. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They put us in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and that was really -- that was real <span class="NPIP">hell</span> because everybody was dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I wouldn't be surprised that 85 percent of the people died there because the diarrhea and the stench and the frozen bodies were unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Every <span class="NPIP">place</span> you sat next to a corpse. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And one of my friends I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, actually she was not in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> I was, this was kind of a -- they decided to gather all the rest of the <span class="REGION">area</span> of these people in . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">It was like the last step, and she was in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">She came over to me and she said, "Henny you are still walking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Would you help me bury my mother?" </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And I helped her carry out her mother, because the first thing they did was make us dig deep <span class="DLF">ditches</span> because they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And I dropped the mother on a pile of bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And I went back -- I went back to this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and surrounded by death, except my two friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">One escaped, two escaped on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">The one with the shoes and the other one kind of also, she escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So two of them left, so the three of us, we're still holding on to each other and suddenly we hear voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They closed the <span class="DLF">barn doors</span> , it was like 10:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I remember because we were liberated, it as an hour later. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">It was 10:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">They closed all the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">They poured gasoline around, all around, and they were going to burn the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">The next thing, it was a matter of I don't know -- the next thing, we hear bagging on our <span class="DLF">barn doors</span> and Russian spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And they opened up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and of course, the ones who could, walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And my friend, my two friends, immediately ran out, and I don't know, not too many ran out because as I said, I wouldn't be surprised if 15, 20 percent of people made it, were able to walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I mean maybe they carried them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">End of Tape #3 Tape #4
ANSWER:  I don't remember exactly but all I know is that when we were brought in there quite a number of people, but when we left, there were only a handful who could walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So, I ran out. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">A Russian grabbed me, and he handed me a rifle and he had our guards, these young shnooks, I think two or three of them or four of them, I think four of them, few, because some of them run away, lined up along the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And he said, shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">He handed me, it was clicked, the whole thing, he said go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">He said do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I held the gun in my hand, and I thought to myself, that's ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Should I become like them? </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And I threw away the rifle, and the Russian he yelled to me in Russian , Stupid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">QUESTION:  Did other people shoot at the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">ANSWER:  No, they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I'm telling you, I was the first one to run out because I walked luckily. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So then they took my two friends, I think one of them could hardly walk, so we dragged her, and they went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , at that time, was deserted, because all the Germans ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And you could get in any <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">So, we found ourselves a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">The three of us settled in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And the first thing I did, I went to milk a cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">There was a cow in the back, and the cow kicked me, lucky, and she kicked the whole milk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And if that wouldn't have happened, we would have died, because that was the first poison to drink milk or butter or anything of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">So, we opened up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinets</span> , and it was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there, it was under German occupation, this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> , there was food there called , the things you put in jars for the winter with the rubber seal, and they had all kinds of fruits, so we started with cook fruits, a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And the next thing my two friends came down with typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I didn't -- I wasn't very sick, but I was also sick, so I took care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And then the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">The Russians were in the Army, and they needed women, and they were going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , disregarding anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">That time we decided we weren't going to let anybody in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  How did you know this was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  You know, that's a very interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">You really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">It's an instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">It's an instinct you find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">If your life depends on it or if it's something, you just find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Probably somebody knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said don't let in the Russians, even if they say they are Jews and they want to help you, because they are like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So, finally somebody came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and kept on banging and banging and started speaking Yiddish, "please let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I've been on the front for so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I'm a mess." </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I said, "we're all sick with typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">There is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep." </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They did not have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">They didn't have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> because the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , were taken up by the survivors which weren't many. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And some of them, the Germans still were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I don't know, but they said they were exhausted and they had to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And he kept on speaking Yiddish and I decided I'll take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So, we let him in, and he happened to be a very nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And he laid down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">He was totally exhausted, and he just wanted to help us and see what he could do for us, and in the morning he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And then I took sick, and then the three of us kind of made it, and we decided to keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Now, I don't know -- the Russians, that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">After we got well, they said they were going to take us to . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And from there they were going to send us wherever we want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Since we are from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , they'll send us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I knew that I wasn't going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So, we came to , and we worked there all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">We actually watched the Germans load <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , and we were actually the drivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">We were guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  For the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  For the Russians, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And then I decided, I heard rumors again, they were going to send us -- we were five women, they were going to send us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , not <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">They'll send us to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> someplace on one of those <span class="DLF">farms</span> , and I decided I'm not going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">So, I took whatever I had, next to nothing, I threw it out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">There was a guard watching the <span class="REGION">area</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where we were actually housed, Russian stayed there and people who worked for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And they had a guard and a <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and you just had to announce before you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">There was a curfew there. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">You couldn't leave just whenever you felt like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">But my <span class="DLF">window</span> faced the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , so I threw whatever a small bundle out, probably some underwear and whatever, and I just went to the guard, and I told him I'm going to the movies, and he said okay, go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So, I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I picked up my little bundle, and I ran to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going anyplace, no matter where you wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And I really didn't know where I was going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I said I wanted to go west. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and there were two underground soldiers sitting, and they said they come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , and they heard that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> there 1s an organization, an organization was established to find out who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">It's like what do you call those <span class="BUILDING">centers</span> , where everybody sends their family -- but it's a center for all survivors so they can find people whoever tells them who they were looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">There was no mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I mean it was really only word by mouth, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I said okay, I'll go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">So we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> at 6:00 in the morning, and they wanted to take me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep over, and I didn't particularly care for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So, when I got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I decided to make it fast, and they yelled, "we fed you with chocolate." </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They gave me chocolate, that's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I went away, and I got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> at 6:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">My Polish was kind of rusty, so I asked the driver where is the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> , and he said, "I'll take you there." </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So, I arrived there, and I walked in there and that was around 7:00, 8:00, and I registered, and I told them I want to work for you and they said okay, go behind there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So, that is where I wound up. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I was bald then because we were all shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And I was wearing a turban usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And then one afternoon when I got through working, I went upstairs in the common area where there are a couple of dozen women are sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in some kind of makeshift <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bags</span> , and I removed my turban. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I needed some fresh air, and I walked out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> to go over to a friend of mine, and there was my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So, he even met me without my turban.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">QUESTION:  You must have been stunned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  Yes, that's putting it mildly because I really didn't know what happened to him, and I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I figured what the heck, I speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I don't have anybody any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the world so I might as well go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And they would have sent me awfully quickly because many <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> young people in '37 and '38, and I figured I would try a nota , but I will try it, and then I will take it from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And then my Prince Charming appeared, and 1t was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And then we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We decided we were going to start our lives all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It's no use living in the past because we had nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">The world had gone mad so what should we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">It could have happened to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">So we're not going to let that ruin us and bring up our children with complexes. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">They probably have other complexes, but certainly we didn't spoon feed them about our experiences and about the world that everybody is terrible, because there are some decent people in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">It was just a terrible experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  When you do think about this, because even though you want to live in the present, you have to think about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  Well, sure I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">QUESTION:  Are there certain memories that haunt you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">ANSWER:  Except that time when I knew I was going to die without my shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">That's my worst experience in my life -- that's not the worst, but for personal -- I have never felt as close to death as this moment, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Because, as I said I always think that things are going to turn out all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Everybody calls me Polyanna, but I just hope it eventually will turn out all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a strange question. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">How did you feel about being Jewish throughout this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">ANSWER:  I never thought of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I never thought specifically about being Jewish, why it happened to me you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  Well, I'm wondering did you wish you weren't Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Did you feel more Jewish than ever?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">ANSWER:  No, no I didn't feel more Jewish than ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I'm going to tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I don't if it has something to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">We have a son, and a daughter and seven grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And our son married a catholic young woman from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And my friends were telling me -- it was a long time ago 21 years ago -- friends were telling me my god it's terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">How can you take it? </span><span class="sentence" id="909">How can you live with it? </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I went to my rabbi and had a long conversation, and I said, you know intellectually I can understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">She's a nice woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">That's what he wants, what the heck, who am I am? </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Emotionally I don't think I can take it but I'll probably take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And as the years went on and people asked me I said, you know the more we have on our side, the better off we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So, that is my philosophy in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">The more people think of Jews as equal people in this world, the more chance we have of not having something like that happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Because he was a madman and all his nation went mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I mean these people went mad and the ones -- there are a lot of nice ones there I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I'm not going to condemn the whole German population, but the majority of them said they didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">How could they not know about it, and how couldn't they foresee it, but I'm not a philosopher to try and figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But it's terrible that people in power can motivate young people to become so unfeeling, so beastly without any remorse, and they can really turn them into terrible human beings, so it shows you. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">So, I can't tell you if I felt bad being Jewish or good being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I didn't think about 1t much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">QUESTION:  Anything else you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  I'm glad you are here because I was going to write a book, and I know I'd never get to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So, I had very mixed feelings when you said you were going to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I knew I'd have to go through that ordeal, but at least our family and all our grandchildren and great grandchildren and so on and so forth, if they want to know something about us -- although they all asked through the years, the little ones and the big ones, but we always answered them what they asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">We never gave them more information. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But now at least they can go to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and press a button and listen to their grandparents if they want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">If they don't want to, just let them be nice human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">That's all we want them to be, and I thank you for coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview </span>
