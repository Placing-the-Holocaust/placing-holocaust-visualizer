<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Well, that was -- that was a dramatic turning point. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">To begin with there was the hope, the persistent hope that if we don’t get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> today, due to some administrative technicality, we would be -- we would be allowed to get off tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It -- 1t should be -- I should not fail to mention that the Hapag-America line, the Hamburg<span class="DLF">-America line</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">shipping company</span> did compel the passengers to pay for a return ticket, because we did not have authentic visas, as the - the entry permit is known --is -- is known today. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We did not have a -- a resident visa, we had a landing permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And -- which was sold by a Minister of Immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And that, in the political arena, resulted in a jealous confrontation between various segments in the Cuban government, and the ultimate rejection of -- of the -- of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> to disembark. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And so when then went past another day, and the American Jewish organizations used their -- tried to use their influence to somehow have Franklin Delano Roosevelt, F.D.R. as he was known, to -- to admit the passengers, which he failed to do, had he known that two-thirds of the passengers would end up in gas an-and g -- be gassed in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and so on, he may have -- in my view, he may have had -- taken a different sort of action. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">As it was, he -- he refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">In fact he marked a note with the comment, no action. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">He turned back every effort to allow these people to disembark. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">He and his administration sent the 937 victims to -- for most of them, to their death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ultimately appealed to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , to -- to every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world for asylum and the response throughout the world was the same, in th -- terms of not allowing these people into their respective <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And this is precisely the reason that the Saint Louis became a -- a world event. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Not in the same way as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> , because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> was sunk by an iceberg and the Saint Louis was sent back to Europe for an uncertain fate of their passengers by reason of politics and racial -- racial confrontation and discrimination.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1414">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> I worked through my connections at that time in the hotel industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I came close to the management of the Fairmont Hotel company, which was based at the time 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And they had a t -- a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">But that was in 1975, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> had not as yet become what you would like to call an international city. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And they were not used to -- and the -- they were not used to those prices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And so when I said that I -- first hand experience, I -- I came to manage the <span class="INT_SPACE">Venetian Room</span> , which was the <span class="BUILDING">nightclub</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Fairmont Hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And Tony Bennett appeared there and -- and well, and a number of other entertainers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And when the phone rang for someone to make reservations, they would say, well how much does it cost to get in? </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">So I would say, well the cover charge is 15 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">And the response on the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> would be, and what do you get for that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">And without trying to -- without -- trying to avoid to sound sarcastic, I would say well, you get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and you get to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">But how else -- what else would you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Th-That was the logical answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And consequently the entertainment of that -- that caliber of entertainment again went the way they did it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">And so Richard Swig, who was owner of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> decided that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> -- the only thing that would work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> would be western entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And so they brought in Loretta Lynn and a couple of other -- and Alison Krauss, some people with a [indecipherable] with a reputation in the area of western music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And so you had a lot of -- I don’t want to use the term -- I -- I think that to say rednecks, you know, would probably not take -- take too well, so let’s say country folk, or whatever you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">But they -- the western music in -- in that -- that kind of caliber of western music didn’t do it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And del -- later on, a number of years later, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> got very fine <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and it built tremendous <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and what was expensive at tha -- at that time turned out to be cheap because prices went up and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> grew to be an international city, and they built a new <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and it is what it is today, you know, a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
