<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  (both talking) Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Everybody and in a sense with hindsight I think I would have been lynched if I hadn’t shouted Heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">In the first row. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So it was, but I didn’t do it as a survival strategy. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I was literally hypnotized. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">There was millions of people screaming their heads off so you know what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">You join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">But then when I got to and there’s this Jewish queue in front of the <span class="BUILDING">Yugoslav embassy</span> and they all looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">What do I do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">You know Otto hadn’t sort of prepared for me for, all he had said was take our passports, get our mothers to give you all our passports and go and ask for Mr. Miderman. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">That’s all I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But he didn’t tell me how he knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And you know what should I say when I meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So at that point really I became another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I told my second lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">You know when I saw this and I managed the guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And the guard, my second lie was. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I still remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">The guard said well what do you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I said I want to see Mr. Miderman. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And he said do you know Mr. Miderman. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I said yes of https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 course. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">You know but you know at a moment’s notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And then when I saw Mr. Miderman and he even said how did you know about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Why did you come here? </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So I took out my passport and said to him I’ve come to collect visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He said who told you about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And it was at that point that I thought, but before this I had seen that he was packing so I thought I didn’t know what he was but he was packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He didn’t seem resident there. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Otto hadn’t told me but immediately I said Otto can’t have known him. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He is obviously somebody that is going somewhere now. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And then he told me he was the ambassador for <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and since <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was no more an independent state he was moving back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">That was all and he couldn’t give any visas then. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">But he said well who told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I think Otto. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I don’t know how but ultimately you know how he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Did I say that in the — he signed the waivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We’d been to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He signed them so he read Mr. Miderman signs the visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So she must go and see Mr. Miderman. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And for him it was simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But that I wouldn’t know what to say didn’t occur to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So I thought at the spur of the moment if I say my brother had sent me, he would say well who is your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And how do I explain that? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So I then produced Uncle Willie. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And said my uncle rang me last night. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I was lying right left and center. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">The sort of moral behavior disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  But that I never found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">But once I had said he rang me and he had said I should meet Mr. Miderman at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , he didn’t ask me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Whether he knew him or not but I think I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">But I’ve worked out that he might not have known him but might have thought he should have known him. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And he was I said to, he is one of the biggest textile manufacturers in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">You must know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">What he, what went on his mind I don’t know but it was that, that he then put his arm around my shoulder and he said well I’ll try and find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And he walked me to the counsel and just knocked and (inaudible) pushed me in and said I am bringing you a young friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">She needs visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Well it took three months, but I went there when you know and then when I got the visas he said, the counsel said well how did you know Mr. Miderman. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And I said he was just a friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  Did you tell him that you were Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION:  Ok so you got the visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , for the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  The thing is at that time before that Otto was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">My father was in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and we, there was supposed to be a plebiscite for the Austrians to vote yes or no, whether we want, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> wanted to be in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Now I think now when I remember that crowd that I saw that Hitler needed have no worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He would have been voted in anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">But he didn’t wait for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But all the Jews, by that time, my father knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I mean he had known that he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But he also knew what the Jews were suffering in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So he then knew, you know he must come, all the Jews who were outside <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , but were Austrian citizens were all making back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to cast their vote in the hope that they would influence the result. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So my father had rang us by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">We had a telephone and said I am just going on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but just then about five minutes before, we had just heard Schuschnigg’s last speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And that was horrifying because he was always, he made a lot of speeches, all <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> must vote and must vote for independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">That’s what he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And he was making another speech and all of a sudden you heard as if things were knocked about and you didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I mean you listen to the radio and you heard knocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And then you heard him say, people are just coming in and they are taking me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">This is the end of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">God bless <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and Horst Wesselneed [ph], you know the German which goes today <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , belongs to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Tomorrow the whole world. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So we knew the Nazis had, but what had happened was that the Nazi, German troops Hitler had already arranged for the German troops to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , I mean <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> didn’t have a (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So this was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And my father then rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And Otto answered the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">My father said I am just going to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to catch the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And Otto said well you know it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Immediately you felt the Nazis would be listening to what you say. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I mean they weren't that efficient to hacking, phone hacking, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Murdoch now has been doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">But this was sort of mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So then Otto said don’t come back and my father said but I must be with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Don’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I can’t tell you anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Listen to what your radio is saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And my father was never in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> after that which was very difficult for https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 me because to him, I remained his little girl that can’t make, little girls don’t make decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You know important what you should do, what you shouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">But before that after that, when Otto was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , he wrote to me that he had a network of friends also Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">But they were all social democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">It was that that bound them together, not their (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And one of them, he actually died in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He was a close friend of Otto’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And he was married already and he had, they were living in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So he wrote to, Otto was trying to get Kurt out but he couldn’t get him. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Otto then flirted with one old lady who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">British home office</span> who was in charge of giving visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And he had a reason why he flirt, and he ultimately got a visa for Kurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But he didn’t, couldn’t get it quick enough and he too knew that Kurt was really very frightened and it was hard there. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So this friend said, because Austrians didn’t need a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> but if you went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> you could cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">But not if you had a passport with a big red J. The Italians didn’t want that. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">But ordinary Austrians, not Jewish could just go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So he then, this friend from him, who settled in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , wrote to Otto and told him send your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">He knew Kurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And he actually stayed with them in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They said send him by <span class="DLF">air</span> , because the Italians had not yet realized that you can fly and that you can arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the border people, the border police was trained. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">You see a passport with a red J, back, no you know but they flew. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">At the <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> they hadn’t trained police, trained people who spoke there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  So Kurt flew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  I got Kurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Kurt wouldn’t go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I, so Otto wrote to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">You went to the chet [ph] the Italian travel there and then book a flight as early as you can for Kurt to fly to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Once you’ve got the ticket tell me and he will get, arrange that he will be met on arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And I was very cross then when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Kurt then flew to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and second week in May and the Anschluss was in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And he was very cross with me that I hadn’t got him a flight the day after. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So that’s why there was never a very close relationship with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">QUESTION:  So Kurt is off to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">You stayed with your mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and your father was in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011

<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  No, no because there were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , sharks. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">When I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">Yugoslav embassy</span> , there was one guy that asked me what I had been doing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And I said I’ve come to collect visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I had and he said have you go them yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">He said well if you convert, I can get you a birth certificate of grandparents, because you had to have at least two, grand, non- Jewish, Christian.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes, yes and I mean I, Otto didn’t tell me about him so I didn’t bother. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">But it wasn’t only me that he stopped because he knew all those Jews that were in the queue, they are unlikely to get the visas.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="837">QUESTION:  But you didn’t consider converting in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> for example because <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> also gave certificates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  No but not for your grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">You have to think of the total implication and yes and they convert you. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I mean there was the book Michel, Michel, did you ever see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">A little boy whose parents were Jewish in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Whose parents gave him in to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> through the nuns, say. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And after the war, the parents perished but some relative were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and they then went to find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">They had to fight because the nuns wanted to keep him. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And this little boy obviously, I have here actually a very interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I go swimming to the <span class="BUILDING">Metropole</span> which is a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Have a <span class="BUILDING">leisure center</span> and they usually have fire alarms and usually they have training. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So if you are in the <span class="DLF">pool</span> , you go and just put the dressing on and you have to go upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">reception</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And then it goes all clear and that’s all finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">But once at last a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">We were all from the pool standing, we were in the, all <span class="INT_SPACE">dressing room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And there was a young woman and I was sort of shaking my head showing that I was impatient. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">It wasn’t, why do they keep us in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But actually then the fire brigade came and there had https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 been an actual fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And one person had lit an electric fire and that had caught something and so there had been a fire in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But there was this young woman who somehow, I don’t know why it is when I find a fellow Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I somehow feel that they are fellow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I don’t know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Do you know?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  Well [ll tell you what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">When I got there even the Greek Orthodox and even the Christian women would all go around veiled and would not go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , except prostitutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Other women would not go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> without a chaperone, a male chaperone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">So there was I coming with socks, short dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I mean my school uniform and what I used to wear in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And there was a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And you see the richer Albanians sent their children into <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> for education to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So then they came back so there was a group of young Albanians who really didn’t have to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">They didn’t have to do anything to get money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And they really didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">They were bored stiff and when they saw me they came and they surrounded me and I didn’t know Albanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">They talked Albanian and I didn’t know Italian or any and, andI felt scared and they touched my shoulder and then I said in French, I could do colloquial in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And they spoke French and I said what are you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">What do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And they said well are you a real girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I said I’m a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I know that you know why am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">So then they said well women don’t go like you so I then said well I come from a different culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And there was a famous actor, an Albanian called Moishe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">They knew him, who was very famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I knew of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">He played in drama performances in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And he was very good and had a big reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">So they asked me did I know him and I said yes, I know of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">So I then, they wanted to know for them it was sort of Austrian in general, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in particular were sort of the center of sophistication and education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">It was, they built up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in like a dream setting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Not the way I remembered it.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Well I was then 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Going on for 17 and they were 14 and 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">So that I wasn’t much older than them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">But I wasn’t going to miss out on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">So he then took me to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which was right opposite the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , opposite the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">It was lovely and they had like the Muslims, the women live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">purdah</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">You know there’s women, there’s a female section of the quarter, <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> and the male one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And so obviously the girls were in the female one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And I fitted into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So I remember I was really very cheeky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">I did, I mean I knew French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I had done colloquial French, but I wasn’t perfect, by any means. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And there are many things that I didn’t know the French for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Well I was teaching it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Well how do you teach a language to others when you have no language in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">If you and I know English and I want to teach you Albanian, well I can tell you the English words and learn like I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">But if, if we don’t have a common language it is very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">So what I then did was to point this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and I would say the English, the French and the German word, if I knew the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">The German I would know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And they would write it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And the next day I would say what is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And I’d expect them to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Well sometimes they asked me for the French word and I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">So you know what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">I invented French words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">But I said the words so quickly that they couldn’t write them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">So the next day then I went back and I had a dictionary all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I knew the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">Next day I would say well what is this, French, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">You know it in German, yes, you know it in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Now we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Well write it down now properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Now I have been trying to find the heirs of this Dowana family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">Because they were wonderful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">The women of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , their mothers and aunts and all the relatives that were there, they were all very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">First of all they always served me with coffee, Turkish coffee and biscuits which was great really for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And secondly, from their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a lovely big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> right opposite the <span class="DLF">port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I sat there with looking out well obviously this is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 I would look out at the <span class="DLF">port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">And I always loved the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , and I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I told my mother I was born at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">So and they were all so nice to me and I had a nice environment and I had regularly something to do and they paid me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">But I was the only refugee that they all saw
QUESTION:  Where did you live? </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Was there a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for all the refugees to live or did you stay with families?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  Well that’s where the Joint came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">These two men that met us, told, first of all they said, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which was the dirtiest and filthiest <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I mean this was for my parents you know we had to say go and have a bottle of eau de cordel [ph] which we had to the loo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I mean it was, and the linens were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">And it was really awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">But these two men had said you must just stay there for a week because we will look at your credentials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">But if you pass, which we think you will, you can then move, because what they had done, the Joint, there were some <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And there were also Jewish salesmen from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , selling to these Jewish shop keepers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And the Joint was sending money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">However many refugees turned up and lived because they had rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And they got, and the shop keeper that got the money from the Joint always had to get a piece of paper from the board of guardians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">These were elderly Polish or Austrian Jews and to send it to the Joint that they would always continue sending. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">It was very, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">I mean really as a growing girl I was starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And I, and there was a larder which was always locked and once they had forgotten to lock it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And I saw it open and I sneaked in and I got a big piece of bread and I was delighted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">But next day I was hauled before the board of guardians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">That you don’t do and my father burst into tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">You know his little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">He couldn’t supply enough food that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">I mean it was natural, but I didn’t feel terribly guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I was angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">There was bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">Why shouldn’t I?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1321">QUESTION:  So the Joint was paying for this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the refugees were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">How many people were there in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">ANSWER:  Well when we got there, there were about 35. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011
QUESTION:  35. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Did you manage to either keep in touch with any of those people or to find them after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  Well now you see after we left, then Otto got visas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1327">QUESTION:  So you left for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1328">ANSWER:  We left but wait a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">He got me one as a hairdresser apprentice and my mother as a domestic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">Well we weren’t terribly delighted but better going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">So but not for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">So we tried to delay leaving him because he was really suicidal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">He would go along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and was ready to jump in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And you know it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">So we felt that my mother didn’t want to leave her husband and I didn’t want to leave my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">But Otto kept extending our visas, but then he sent me a letter and he said listen, unless you arrive before the end of April, 1939, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I cannot extend them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">You will never be able to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">So you better come with mother and he said I promise you and mother, you talk with mother and tell her he will do anything just to get a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">My father came a week before the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">QUESTION:  Wasn’t there also a story where you were giving language classes to the Italian counsel or ambassador that become very important later on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">The Italian counsel heard that I was teaching German because these were elite families and I guess there were evening dinners and they must obviously have been together with the local elite.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">QUESTION:  So there would be what associated with the royal family or the aristocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1345">ANSWER:  Yeah so and he was a very nice guy and he said, they told him you know that I was teaching their daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">So he said tell her I want to see her and so they told me and I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Ad he then told me that he wanted me to, he wanted to learn German because Mussolini and Hitler were in https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and it was when they were together, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">I mean Mussolini was Hitler’s role model. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">He really, he wasn’t anti-Semitic at first, for a long time but in terms of his — you know that Mussolini invented the term fascisma [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">So you know he was the role model. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">So this counsel thought it would help him in his career to know German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">And so I started teaching him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And I think you must remember this out of my autobiography. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">Then we were still there when Mussolini occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">And this counsel became the first governor of the <span class="REGION">coastal region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So the war, the Jewish — we thought that Mussolini would hand us refugees like a present over to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Because it seemed obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">We were the only thing that Mussolini got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">That Hitler may want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">So we were all terribly -- I mean they were just everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">We were sitting in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> when the fighting was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And what was really moving was the next door policemen were worried because they told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">I mean you could see the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">warships</span> on the horizon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">It was a <span class="DLF">port</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">The only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had was the private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yacht</span> of King Zog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">I mean that couldn’t defend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And the policemen told us all they have to defend Durrés against the Italian onslaught is three machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">And there, the roof of their <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> was flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">And one of these three machine guns was standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">They told us that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And they said well when the Italians will come ashore we will have to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">That’s our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And the Italians will want to knock out these three machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">And if they fail, if they miss, then they will kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And we don’t want that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And we thought, we sat together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And we thought we would, Hitler would throw us out and treated us like nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">And here were these little policemen worried about our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">It was really very moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And I tell them that now too so they then said well tonight they told us, the onslaught was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">They would come ashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">So first of all you have to find a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> because not many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Only the richest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And the richest had gone inland, the Albanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">But they left their servants to take care of their — but we you know we went in and we checked that they have a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">The servants wanted to stop us or they weren’t too strong, strong enough to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">So we found a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not too far from where our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">But before this I must tell you, there were Salonika salesmen, Jewish salesmen selling goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And well one of them was called Major. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">Very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">He was 45 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">For me he was like he had two feet in the <span class="DLF">grave</span> because you know when you’re 16, 17, 45 seems — but he fell in love with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">You must think everybody fell into, that was my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And so he asked my father for give information so that he could marry me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">At first he had asked me and I said I don’t want to https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 marry anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">And then he asked my father and my father said no, she was far too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">But he, then he also came to see -- but he had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">So he was always getting me presents and I didn’t want them because I thought that make me dependent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And anyway when it comes then a little story and a little lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">So we stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> during the onslaught and we heard the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And they then said we, our guardians had a meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">And said let’s surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Let’s not be sort of taken, but let’s surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Let’s say we know we are going to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but let’s do it with our heads up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Let’s show them that we have courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">So ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">So they said well then the shooting stopped and so they said well now we will go and somebody who has, who can speak Italian must lead us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">Well who could do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">I was the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">In teaching German and French I picked up, I’m not fluent but I picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">So they gave me a stick and a white handkerchief for army and I should lead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">So I led and I was trying to say in Italian, as best as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">We are a group of German and Austrian Jewish refugees and I kept repeating this in my mind as we were walking along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">And we must have been a really crazy lot, looking, you know these old men and women were shuffling along and wearing different kind of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">Anyway, and then came three Italians, one an officer with two guys from around the corner and saw us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And shouted halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">So I said stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">So we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And then as I had expected, he came up to me and said who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And so and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">So I then said in my, in the sentences I had rehearsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">I said we are a group of German and Austrian -- and he didn’t let me go any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">I didn’t get, have to say Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">He put his arm around my shoulder and said Tedesk1, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">Italian, friends, amigo,. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">amigo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I didn’t disillusion him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">And so in a sense that was another saving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">So then he put his two soldiers in charge of walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">He said where do you live? </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">And I said over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">I didn’t say that was the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">And so he walked us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">But on the way back I thought well if they look through our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and if the police had wanted to hide their guns, then they might have put some into our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and if these Italian soldiers find them then the friendship will be off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">But they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">They let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">They looked through them but the soldiers said the police hadn’t hidden anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">But then I heard somebody knock at the back, where we had the <span class="DLF">window</span> looking out at the <span class="DLF">wasteland</span> and there was a guy standing in Albanian uniform because they had a very small unit of soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And he made me understand that he wants clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">He wants to get https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 rid of his uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">So I gave him one pajama of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And he stuck, changed there and this was my contribution to the freedom fight of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">But then the next day the, who was then the governor, the Italian ex Italian counsel, his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came to our <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> and a uniformed driver, chauffeur had a letter And he had, the guardians went to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">And it was addressed to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">So they were all excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Says now we mean, we are being sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">And I opened it and it said now I need you even more and he sent me a letter with so many stamps and he sent every day his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , was picking me up and there are so many guard posts on the way because they had just occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">I actually went last July when I made this film because King Zog’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was at the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and of course King Zog had fled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">So this new governor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had moved into King Zog’s <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">So we went, I got in touch with the grandson and I said well they want to film it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">So they allowed us in because there weren’t many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">So this is and then I have to -- and then my Greek boyfriend said, and he knew we had the -- among the young lot who were my sort of I was the pied piper and they followed me was a travel agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">Because I had gone, since we had the visas for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I went to the French ambassador and said can I fly because Air France was the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airline</span> that would fly from <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , fuel, stop there for refuel and then go on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">So that’s the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> that I thought we were taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">But they told me I should go to the French ambassador to make sure and do you know they were bastards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">We would have, my mother and I would have just stayed the 20 minutes that it would have taken them to refuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">But they did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">And they said we do not want refugees in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">At a later date they may have had different stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">So then among this lot of young men, was one travel agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">So I asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">I said well how can I get from here because I can’t go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I have to go you know flying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">I can’t fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">So how do I get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">So he then said there is one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> that goes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> and if you board that, there was one coming that would get you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> on the 25" of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">So that was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">So and we paid him and the Joint sent money for our friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">I had one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">But this Salonika guy said my dear I want to give you 500 pound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">I want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">And I thought no, I’m not being bought for 500 pounds and said no I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">He then said well look don’t be so silly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">I'll give you the 500 and you take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">If you do not need them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">If you don’t have to use them I’ll give you my, the details of my bank account in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and you pay the 500 pounds into that <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">And that is what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 But I am sure because all the Salonika Jews went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and it was this, he was the general secretary of the you know, the Austrian . </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">He was then the officer for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">And they occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> and ordered them all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">So I’m sure that this, not only he had an account that I know because, but I can kill myself for not writing it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Because I am sure there is a lot of Salonika money invested in the British and <span class="BUILDING">American banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">But no, I mean the heirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">This guy was not married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">I don’t know how many were married, how many had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">But the second generation wouldn’t know the details . </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">So why don’t the American Jewish -- ’m trying here the Jewish community, why don’t they sort of write to the — they said I should do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Well I can’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">But a Jewish community representative can say you know the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">The American and <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> have really been very tough and gotten a lot of money out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">But they themselves have never said we also have some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">And they must have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">Because you know the rich Jews in Europe and particularly a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> will have invested, will have bank accounts here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">So the Swiss had to pay up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Why don’t they, why don’t the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">Or the American money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">But no, nobody wants to take that on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1498">QUESTION:  So then you did eventually come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , the both of you, your mother and yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">But tell us about the journey to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1500">ANSWER:  Well that’s what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">So my brother said I must be arriving with my mother before the end of April so this travel agent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durrés</span> gave me a voucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">I paid with part of the Joint money for the journey and I had a voucher for two <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> , for two people to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> that was supposed to arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> about 25, about in the first week of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">So off we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">And my mother, Otto had said you must come because if you do not arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , before the end of April you won’t be able, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">So I wrote (inaudible) for him to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">So I took my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">We were crying a lot and she, you know it’s very sad really if you leave by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> because the <span class="REGION">land</span> gets smaller and smaller as you depart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">You know air flight is quick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1509">QUESTION:  Did you like traveling by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1510">ANSWER:  Yes I do, but not if you leave somebody behind who you would like to have with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And my father was getting smaller and smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011
QUESTION:  But there were other refugees who stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">You weren’t the only two who left then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1514">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">But most of them were hidden during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">For most of them you can see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">You want to see the rescue in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">Most of them were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">And there is actually one who married an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">She is called Joanna Newman with whom I am in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">She said, I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">She said that she arrived with her parents also from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">They were from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but then they made it to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> they were thrown out and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durrés</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">But I had, I must admit I have no recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">But that doesn’t mean that, she was obviously there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And in that film you can see her in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">She seems a very nice lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">And now I’m on the Albania Mafia and so because there is a lady in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who 1s called, she is a dentist, a doctor, Anna Cohen and she now also wants me to come and tell my story to her American Jewish lot and we are on very friendly terms but I have never met her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">So I now know quite a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And they all, she you can see her on that film. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">She was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> during the war and her mother was saved because they also -- what she has been doing for <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> is when there are youngsters who have been diagnosed with a disease for which they don’t have any treatment in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">There are quite a lot of such individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">That she will arrange, she will get the medical report. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">And if she knows, she will then establish whether if they are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they can get the treatment that will make them well again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">She gets money, she’s got money in her fund. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">She pays for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">They fly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">She arranges their treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">Once they are well again, back they go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">So also during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">She also feels in a sense she was born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And if the Albanians hadn’t saved her mother, she wouldn’t be there either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1543">QUESTION:  So then you arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">By <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1545">ANSWER:  So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> we stayed for the first, and while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> the men made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> out of orange boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">My father made <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">We slept on hearths or in boxes or <span class="INT_SPACE">cupboards</span> and but the Joint money helped us to stay in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">Not a posh one but so I left my mother in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">For her this was, she was still broken hearted, having had to leave my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">But she felt for the https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 first time she was sleeping in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">We were both there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">And I said you stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">I’Il go and get our tickets for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">So I had the voucher and I went to this address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">I found it and I produced my voucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And they said oh it’s a pity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">What date do you have to be in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">I said end of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">They said well this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is two months delayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">You know I tell this story always to the kids and when I will say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">It’s oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">When you feel you —there’s nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And I didn’t know a soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">I mean how was I to know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">And I knew my mother, if I tell her she wouldn’t say really that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">So I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and had a good cry for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">And then I said well then I said I must let me Otto know what the problem is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">Because I realized I mean if we can’t get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> then he can’t do anything but at least he would know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">But then I looked up and you know this Italian travel agency, cit, C-I-T is still was then still working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And it still, you can still see Cit Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">So I looked up and there was Cit, so I said well maybe this is a sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">So I went in with our passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And I said I need a flight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">Can it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And he said no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">He said have you got the money to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">I mean I was a young one and I got out, I had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">Dollars so, it was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">So he said no problem at all and so he rang Air France. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">And he said well the passports I wouldn’t be (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">We won’t tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">Well he rang other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airlines</span> , but of course the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> needed and couldn’t fly such long distances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">Everyone had to refuel on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">So we had a tough time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">But the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airline</span> that would take us was KLM. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">But KLM was, we were boarding and we had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> we could get onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">KLM flight</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">KLM flight</span> went, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">So I knew so that is when I wrote a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">I mean in a sense like Horst Teers mother when she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , writing her last letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">I wrote a letter to Otto and I said we were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flight</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">KLM</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">We are supposed to arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> but if we can’t get through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , then you know where we to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">But that’s all I could say and I gave him the time we were due. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">But then I said well how do I get it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">So I went to talk to the KLM steward and that he is another one who had saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">Because really when you come and see you know taken every step, it was really true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">Somebody turned up that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">Because I said you know I said you know we are Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">You can see our passport and I said do we have to get out when we dock at <span class="DLF">German ports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">They said yes, the Germans don’t allow anybody to remain on https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">So first stop was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and I said to mother and as we landed we saw all those swastika flags and all those SS young men and SA brown u — I mean it was really, you know it brought back all we had seen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">We thought we got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">And my mother was terrified so I said listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">We’ll walk straight and we will show we are not scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">So we all had to go through immigration so when I showed our passport, he said (German) you know what are the requirement, (inaudible) have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">So I said no, we’re not returning to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">I said you can see we have an English visa and that’s what our tickets say and that’s where we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">So he said ok and thankful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">And we sat down but then when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , we all had to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">And the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> was full of people from passengers from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">And they announced over the loudspeaker Frau Und [ph] report. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">So I then thought well couldn’t we disappear in this , how would they find, but then I realized with our passports because everybody had to fill out so then that’s when the worst (inaudible) in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">Because two Nazi bitches, really you can’t use any other term. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">They were in the female SA, SS uniforms, black skirts black, jackets, swastika and they took us into a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and then said now strip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">Strip? </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">I felt you know I couldn’t say, but what they were after was what we were smuggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">They went through every seam in our you know skirts and I mean I can’t describe and then they were beating us and my mother collapsed and I had to pick her up and they would then say stop helping this cow of a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And I mean it just, I don’t want to remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">But then fortunately I had this letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">I had forgotten that I had it in one of the pockets in my jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">The letter from this, what used to be the Italian cultural and it was in the government, with all these stamps and the letter said that you know Miss senorina, senorina Trude, it was all in Italian is a friend of the governor of the coastal area of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and should be allowed to pass because that was for their know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">And when they saw this one of them said, what’s this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">And I said, I then so again I must say when I think my daughters or my granddaughters wouldn’t have but they hadn’t been through everything that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">I said that’s the only thing that we’ll say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">So I said don’t you understand Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">And they said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">I said well then you’re very stupid and I got a big beating but then she said well what does it say? </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">So I then said but I read out something which wasn’t there at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">I said and I know the governor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">I know that they are on the flight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and that senorina Trude Grunewald will let me know when she arrives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">And if I don’t’ hear I will check up on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">I made that up on the spur of the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">And she said you’re lying and I said is there nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">I said everybody like you who doesn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">Tell him tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">https://collections.ushmm.org November 17, 2011 it should be in Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> is your friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">So what are you talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">I got a lot of bashing, but I don’t — so one of them said to the other, look after these two Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">And she went out and she came back and she obviously had found somebody who had read this and understood that it was the Governor of Italian governor of the coastline of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">So she said get dressed and so we were bleeding and we were not in a fit state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">And my mother certainly wasn’t so when I helped her to dress, they stopped me from helping her and it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">And then we were dressed and they said now you can go back on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">So I said our passports because they had them on the (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">They said you have no right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">You can call yourself very lucky that we let you go so don’t ask for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">If I were you two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">So we sort of go, went very slowly and trying to get back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and the steward that I had given the letter was standing, of course there were steps up to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">And he was standing at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , sort of waving, being very happy to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">But then I sort of shook my head so he came down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and said what’s up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">So and I said yes, we can go back to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> but we don’t have passports and if we don’t have passports I know we will never get in for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">So he said leave it to me and he went and he retrieved our -- so you know I felt like kissing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">But foolishly I never tried to get his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">To say thank you because if he hadn’t got our passports we wouldn’t be here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">So there are so many people who all the way have done a good job and have really been helpful.</span></p>
