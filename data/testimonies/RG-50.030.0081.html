<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tell me your full name and when and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Antoni Golba. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born on November 7, 1918 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockniytza</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your childhood and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where you grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Tell me what it was like and what your parents did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My father was manager of the <span class="BUILDING">town Administration Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My mother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We were brought up in special circumstances in that city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockniytza</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We inhabited mostly, I would say, in 85 percent by Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So, we had contacts every day in every situation, most of all with Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father, on account of his functions in the <span class="BUILDING">Office of Administration</span> , dealt with a businessman regarding taxations, all kinds of permits for commerce, permits for trade, and in addition they had some contacts outside of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They used to know -- because they used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together with Jewish people, like my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">She was always, even after she got married, she had Jewish friends with whom they used to sew some clothing, fixing decorations at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">They used to live across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , so they would for a cup of tea or something like that it was a very common thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">They saw each other once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Naturally, at that time, I was maybe less than four or five years old, so I didn't realize what was going on, but I took it for granted that that's the way it should be and nothing is unusual about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Then at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I met also a number of Jewish friends, boys and girls, and particularly with one . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We shared one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">school bench</span> for a number of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">For five years we are sitting next to each other and, of course, very friendly, as a rule, but occasionally little fights, nothing harmful really. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">On top of this, one day we decided that we like music. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So, we started taking lessons on the violin by the same teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Since then, we participated in all kinds of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities, concerts, plays, etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="22">next to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That was going around until the year in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , we separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We went a little bit different ways, because we were getting older and you know had different friends, but still friendly, still playing together. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I used to go to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we used to play duets, classical music, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We liked it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I liked his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very much, very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">His father was a lawyer, very well known lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Unfortunately, he was blind, but that, of course, it didn't mean anything for me or anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He was still one of the best lawyers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1936 and it was starting to make a decision to what profession to take and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So, my father -- originally I wanted to go and study music, but my father said no, it's no good, because you're not going to earn any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">After all, I wasn't anything outstanding, I mean like talent, but I thought I was but my father said, no, you go study accounting and that's the way you will survive this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Sruleck (ph), he decided to study medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">At that time, also, there was some liberal art courses, more advanced than what we had at our <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and he had to take some of them to pass the entrance examination to start the medical studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That was the last time, in 1939, that I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">After that I lost completely track -- I tried very much through friends in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but nobody knows what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He was a very good friend, one of the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That's where he went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  That was before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He started -- he took several liberal art courses between 1937 and 1938 with certain interruptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I don't remember exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Was your family religious, very religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My mother was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My father was very religious too. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He was a member of Parish choir, he had a very good voice, base, and he was participating in all kinds of ceremonies, church events, stuff like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Tell me about the baker you knew named Hiam Gorskey (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Well, Hiam Gorskey, he was actually a baker, but at the same time he was a council man. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So, my father knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He had sort of a business contact with him, but nevertheless, he was extremely friendly and he liked me over a hundred of other children, he liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He used to come to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I used to sit on his knees and play with his beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And he liked that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Of course he had some cookies with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There was no question of bribery or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was simply I liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I liked to play with his beard and I liked his products, his baking. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">His bagels the best in the world as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Of course, at that time he could have been in his sixties, and I don't know what happened to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Tell me what happened when the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in your personal memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Tell me what you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  That was September 1, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I happened to -- I meant to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another from to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busko</span> because I was involved in some Scouts organization so I wanted to see what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busko</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">After all, it was a very important day, and going by it's like a <span class="DLF">highway</span> , not particularly -- the traffic was not too heavy, actually it was nothing really, but what I noticed and that made a very important impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I saw an older woman with a cow in the meadow, not very far from the <span class="DLF">highway</span> with a little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The child was playing probably with flowers and she was probably a grandmother because she was in her sixties. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">All of a sudden an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> came, German, and the German lowered his flight very much and started shooting at that cow, at that woman, at that child. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Naturally in no time he killed everything, the cow, the woman and the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And he kept coming back and he was shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I mean he probably went in some kind of hysteria I should say because no sane person would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was extremely cruel, and I was so shaken by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We heard so much about Germans, you know, how they were going to treat us and everything, but to such an extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">When I arrived to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I was supposed to go, I told them the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Everybody they didn't believe me, but later on they had the proof because someone told them the same story that there was reckless shooting of innocent people, you know, just like this particular one. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That was one event. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Later on, I joined the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I actually was not drafted, and actually I was waiting to be drafted, but everything was so sudden and the administration was mixed up, everything was collapsing, the administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Anyway, I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I joined the Army, a certain unit which conducted some skirmishes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bathos</span> , in the Eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  That would be in about the middle of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  1939, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Everything was interrupted the hostilities were in that particular <span class="REGION">area</span> because not very far the Russians crossed the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> on the 17th of September and of course, we never expected something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We were not prepared for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We understood that we had one enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and that they were going to invade us and probably destroy as much as possible, but all of a sudden, at that time, we didn't know what actually was in that agreement, and that was the story, to participate to divide <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> into two spheres of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Then everything stopped, so the Polish units, some of them were able to go south to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">You know, they were taken there as not exactly prisoners or war, but they were isolated and kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Eventually they let them go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but in my case I decided to return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Unfortunately, of course, there was a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was taken prisoner by Germans and I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> for a couple of hours and I decided not to stay there any longer so I took advantage of a guard that was not paying attention to what was going on, so I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to to my parent's place at the beginning of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">That was my end of the struggle, the unofficial war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the unofficial war started then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Now, in the early German decrees against Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and you and your family tried to help, is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Can you tell me what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  In 1939 there was a panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Of course we expected things to come because the fear that we are going to destroy you, everybody is going to -- we need this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , we need that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for our German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We are growing now. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">My assignment is to extend <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as far east as possible so we'll destroy you Poles and Jews and everybody has to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We knew that there is nothing good coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And of course, they need the manpower for work, so they were arresting a lot of Polish young people, men and women, and sending them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It wasn't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , yet, just forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They used to work on <span class="DLF">farms</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">As far as Jews are concerned, they were very restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They couldn't change their place of residence. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They couldn't move, they couldn't communicate, letters or stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They would have to be controlled by the German officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Every little thing you have to apply to the County which was, of course, in charge by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The Germans were in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You had to get permission for everything, for food, for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">For clothing, there was a shortage of clothing, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There was a shortage of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And, of course, from time to time they demanded from Jewish people to surrender some valuable things in an official or unofficial way, like bribes, you know, trying to get a permit for something, so it cost in the form of gold or something valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Those restrictions, they couldn't move from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In that situation, many young people, Jewish people, people say 20 and up, they knew what was going to happen, so they decided to run away from that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The Polish partisans started organizing so they joined them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , or they simply moved to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> with false identification documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The one case I remember, the next door people his name Shpinrot(ph) had a daughter about 18 years old, Mauka Spinrot, she actually was a friend of one of my brothers, so we talked her into accepting a forged 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">card, like a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I mean, it had more value than just an ordinary 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">card. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was like a passport, showing all the details, names the date of birth, religion, her age, and something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So, we issued the card for Makur (ph) I believe, a Polish name, and of course, Roman Catholic and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So, she took that. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They were very grateful for this and she volunteered for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, this way the Germans treated as one of Poles and no questions asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I'm not sure because I wasn't there, but I'm sure that she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">This was the first case I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">After that, we started doing this more often. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Of course, my people, I belonged to the underground organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">That was the organization before , and of course they wanted to know everything and of course they were helping and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They liked the idea because we kept stealing the forms just for the 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">cards and giving them to the whole county. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So, I am sure that quite a number of Jewish people got those forged 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">cards and they were able to move around to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I'm sure about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  So, mostly what you did was steal the 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">cards, and other people did the forgery?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I mean I could never, writing, some of them were dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Some of them were typed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There was a seal to be applied to that kind and the signature of the chrishelpman(ph) the guy in charge of the <span class="REGION">county</span> , the German fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, they had specialist that could fix that. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They looked like original, there was no question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  In the Polish underground that you were in at that time, were there also Jews in that group? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Did the Poles and Jews work together in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  If I remember correctly, we used to send, because there were some partisans, I mean not very much activity there because they were just organizing everything, so we sent some young fellow, at least two people to join that partisans group, because they were good soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I believe they used to be in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The rule was two years in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They were very well trained soldiers, intelligent guys, so I think we were doing very well there with Polish partisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  You had a lot of Jewish friends, your family did, but did the other Roman Catholics in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> try to help the Jews too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was like everybody had one favorite Jew, a family or one -- like say, my mother, my father, they had a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Anyway, he was the owner of a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> , so we started buying stuff and then the friendship developed gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Other people and actually we were new in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Before the war I think my father was transferred from other <span class="NPIP">place</span> in 1937, so we were not able to know too many people but they accepted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I mean, after all, my father was proved that he was an extremely good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He was self-taught, my God, unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He could do anything for anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So, naturally we were helping people. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The people who were well off like the owners of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , <span class="BUILDING">food stores</span> or <span class="BUILDING">hardware stores</span> or <span class="BUILDING">clothing stores</span> , they were well off people so they were able to disappear simply from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They used to hide in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , but their main belongings, their most valuable things they used to -- they left everything with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They used to come at night, to pick up some parts of clothing or money to buy or we used to buy medicine for them and at night they used to come and pick up the medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">What else was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Food, even shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I remember we got a pair of shoes for a , because it was winter and he needed a pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So we bought, with his money. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We kept his money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  What were you risking by doing that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  A death because that was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">At first, we just couldn't believe that such a thing is possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I mean it's an innocent thing to help to buy some food for somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">This situation is tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We were scared because --especially after they closed for Jews and they prepared -- they moved them from to another bigger <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">This was another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I witnessed, it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I remember the beatings the old men, the old women, children. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They were reckless. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Those Germans were like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Of course, the bastards, they even -- first of all the beatings were one thing, but then the searching for valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">If somebody, of course they assumed since he's a merchant, a well off merchant, he must have something of value hidden, some gold or other stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So, they were crazy, searching the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> was turned upside down and with beatings and kicking, shootings. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They assembled everybody on the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I am talking about one particular day when they decided to move them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , to a bigger <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">That was a terrible thing I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So much blood, I better not talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  Where were you going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  I was hidden on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> on one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We just observed everything that was going on in the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> , you know, down below and I saw many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And then somebody, people who were closer, they were watching all of this from a shorter distance on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> or say next door neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So we collected, for our organization we wanted to have a report of what was done to people on that particular day and so we prepared a written report to the , how this particular procedure was performed in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> of . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">It was early in April 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Was there a round up and they were taking them away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Yes, they formed a column, women, men, children, and they were marching to the next <span class="NPIP">place</span> about I would say about twenty miles away on foot so that there was a lot of old people, of course, they were sick old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They were dying like flies so that was a terrible thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Did the people who were being rounded up try to fight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  No, they were taken by surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  The Germans came with guns?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Naturally, they surrounded the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The best they had, the troops, the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They were quite experienced in those things and very well trained and they hated everybody so naturally that was a reflection. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They were just behaving exactly the way they were asked to behave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  So, after that, most of the Jews were gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  All of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  All of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  All of them, because that was the idea, to clean the <span class="NPIP">place</span> from Jews because of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> , organization of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They moved them, I think to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kyertza</span> (ph), which is about 50 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shedowuf</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So, you can imagine what happened to that column. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I don't know, in that column could have been 1,000 people originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">If 500 reached that <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , maybe more, maybe 600, but the rest small children, no food, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I know because I was in an evacuation like that in 1945 from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to another, so I know how it goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">No food, just shooting, that's all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  But it wasn't executions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  There were executions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  There were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  It was not like executions -- let's say he didn't like the color of your hair or something like that, or in many cases there were quite a lot of old people, in their seventies or eighties, sick, old sick people so they couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They couldn't leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">assembly place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They couldn't go there because they were simply sick and not able to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So, they were shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> , whatever, they were shot and that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They didn't bother -- and after they left, so naturally the town people had to clean the mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So, naturally they had to bury the dead people, to put them together in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It was quite a procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  How did that affect the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  It was a terrible thing, because we had a taste of things to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They used to say, "Oh my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Today they are taking care of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Tomorrow they will come to pick up and start the same thing with us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Everyone was convinced that this was going to happen like. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Young people, as a rule left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They were no longer with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I was not in my parent's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I used to sleep two blocks away in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Every young fellow at that time, just after this, there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Many of them moved to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Some of them they joined the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">What good was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I was there because I was told to stay there because of the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I was responsible for a number of things, and of course, I was hiding but acting. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Gradually things were quieting down, gradually, so I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">There was some of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , old, formerly owned by Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They were opened, but that was the government's property, but they still need people to service. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">In addition, there was a system of distribution of food that especially applied to farmers, the compulsory reporting of agricultural production, what each farmer produced, corn or potatoes or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So, he had to report this, and he had a certain portion, actually the majority of what he produced had to give to the Germans because they need food for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">As a bonus for this, they used to give coupons to buy some hardware on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , stuff like that, ordinary nails, anything, some food stuff, or clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So, they distribute for the produce delivered to the Germans, grain or potatoes or anything, they used to get those coupons so they could get the clothing or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It was something like extra -- of course the prices, they paid very little for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The official price was something unbelievable, low. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">On the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> the price of meat or bread was much higher than what you could get officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">The official price was low. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So, to compensate for this, they issued those coupons to make them more willing to deliver that food stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  While you worked in the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> you were still part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I was told you stay there because many things were going on at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The organization started growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Training was intensifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">There were a lot of things to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We needed <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , <span class="NPIP">place</span> for people who used to come from the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Special messages, so it used -- it was necessary to have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that so I was told to stay there and be in charge of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  So you mostly hid people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  What about weapons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We started collecting weapons in 1939 as soon the hostilities stopped in October after I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we started looking for whatever was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Because in the <span class="REGION">area</span> there was a couple of battles that were Polish forces were defeated because they were not well organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They were not strong enough, so anyway they lost a battle here, a battle there. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, the weapons were left on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , so we decided to collect those weapons and ammunition and keep this and clean it, maintain it until the proper time will come and we'll eventually make use of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So we were cleaning them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">There were special sections who were doing just this, cleaning the weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Maintenance, hiding this in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It was quite a big job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  Then you got caught sometime in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">How did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  Before I got caught, there were many things, -- this <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shidoweouf</span> (ph)_ got a very bad name as far as Germans were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They kept coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They were searching for illegal weapons, food, illegal food, meat, stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It was a center of very unfriendly activities as far as Germans were concerned, so they didn't like that <span class="NPIP">place</span> very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Constantly young people, there were a lot of young people there, mostly university students, like on a vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">It was 1939, so they were not able to return to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Like one family Mr. Kacherofsky, he was the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He was a very well known person. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He had three sons, each of them was a student, one was studying chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">One was a pharmacist I think, and one was medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They wanted to get those young fellows, arrest them, because it is obvious if they are young, and they used to serve in the Polish Army, they are reservists, so naturally they are no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So, what they did just a couple of weeks before they got me, they surrounded, they had a very nice a sort of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with <span class="BUILDING">farm buildings</span> , because they had a little <span class="DLF">farm</span> , they surrounded this and they started shooting without asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So, they killed Mr. Kacherofsky, the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , his wife, and his wife's sister, and there were only two young sons there in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but one was able to escape from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">In spite of the fact that there was a ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The father was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">The mother was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The aunt was dead, and the oldest son, the student of chemistry is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">One of them escaped, so this way they destroyed the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And of course, there was not even a mention or a suspicion that they were helping Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They had nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They probably were, but officially later on they simply wanted those young fellows, because they were Poles, nothing else, and valuable, intelligent, promising, young fellows, so they wanted to destroy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">That was one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Another family on the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in similar way they surrounded it. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They burned down the whole thing, and thank God, as I mentioned before, no young fellow was staying in his original place of residence. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">He was hiding some <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So that was very intensified action against Polish young fellows. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So, no doubt that the Gestapo knew about my activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I mean after all, so many things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So many 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">cards were issued, stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There is something not very clear going on in that <span class="REGION">area</span> where he works, so why don't we get him. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So that's why June 12, 1943, they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and they took me and my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He also was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Actually his father was a couple months before arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they already knew that he was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auscwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I met him, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in April, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">That was the Jewish Ghetto uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I remember hearing the battles going on at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  You were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  No, I didn't participate but we just knew that something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">That exactly was going on, the uprising of Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So, I took this young fellow, a friend of mine, and I brought him to my <span class="NPIP">place</span> and said you have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go so you'll stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It wasn't very long that the Gestapo came and just took us, him and myself, and that was the end of my being a salesman in the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It wasn't too long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  I think that I want to go back and ask you to tell me what you know, tell me as if I never heard of the Polish Home Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Tell me what you knew of the organization, how wide spread it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">What kind of things you heard that were going on nearby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  Well, it started right after the end of hostilities in October 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I have a feeling -- it's a very well known fact that they were prepared for things, for the defeat, because after all, the Germans were very well prepared and we are a poor nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We were not able to be prepared to such an extent as Germans were. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So, they made plans for underground activities because they were hoping that the Allies in the West, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> would definitely help. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Sooner or later, we'll have to be prepared, officially if the Army is no longer in existence at least underground is active. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So, they started organizing right away, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">On two levels, first of all the most important level was the military preparation. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And the other <span class="NPIP">level</span> was the civil administration because they had to keep a network of people for the administration in case of the German occupation will collapse we'll have to take it over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Did everyone know about it then and how did you find out about it and how was communication take place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  Well, one day in , men I used to know when I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , came and he says that he reprsents the underground organization would I be willing to join that. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Things are -- with my background because I was active in boy scouts for all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I was a boy scout, scout master at the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Military preparation and training, so you will have to join us and help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So, I agreed, and I had to be sworn in and originally we started with a small unit like I'd say 85 people that we could know of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The first assignment was just to take care of the weapons, prepare the weapons, hide them and keep them. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">That was quite an extensive activity and many people were involved in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Another <span class="REGION">area</span> was training. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Of course other guys like say myself I was about 22 years old at the time, so I didn't have to be trained, but I had to be an instructor in a little group of say ten young fellows. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I had to train them. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Later on I was asked to join the officers group because I wasn't an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So, I took part in the training of that <span class="BUILDING">underground officers school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Of course we had lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We had all kinds of assignments <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">All kinds of instructors, professional officers from the Polish Army, experts on explosives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  How did your group communicate with other groups? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">How did you find out what else was going on and how long were you training the small group you had; a long time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  That was training after the level of sergeant, but I was there about six months maybe, and in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was about seven, eight months, at the <span class="BUILDING">officers school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Of course, that was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We are meeting -- only once I remember they decided to do some exercises in the <span class="DLF">field</span> so we met, about twenty people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Some of them friends, some of them from different areas, from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , but anyway no more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Besides the assignment was to concentrate on the communications to interrupt communications, to destroy telephone communication, to destroy some of the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So we concentrated on the explosives, theory and some exercises with the real stuff, but not too much because it was very expensive and dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It was dangerous, so we kept this to the minimum. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We took part in the organized group we took part in certain things like I mentioned that the compulsory collection of the farm products, of the registers. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Each small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had a register, extensive control of the people, of the farmers, of the amounts of farm products to be delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">There was official record of that and they kept that in those <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So, at one point, the underground authorities decided to destroy all of this just to show that the Germans will be helpless in case like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They lose control of what was delivered, what is supposed to be delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">They lost control of it so we worked on that systematically. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We are destroying, and it worked very well, because people were able to hide more food for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The Germans started panicking because so little food was delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">OF course the communication, the communication was a very important thing in a case like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We had our own communication between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , so in other words, we knew in advance that the Gestapo 1s coming to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But the official way, there was no telephone because we destroyed the telephone connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But we knew because we had our own networks. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Let's go back and talk about the communication and how you knew the Gestapo was coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="375">How did the communications get to you? ---</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  We had a person working for the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">local Post Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">She was my future sister-in-law, and she was a member of my group, and at the same time she was in contact with a similar person working in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hymernick</span> (ph), which is about 18 miles away, and it was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of German police. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So, of course, every movement of the police was observed and they have some people who were interested in knowing what they were planning to do next, where they were planning to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So, there was a connection, and the intelligence knew roughly, I mean in most cases they know where they are going and when and so they would notify the person working in the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hymernick</span> (ph), who in turn would call our Zosha (ph), my sister-in-law and she would know in say half an hour they will be here so get ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">She would send a message on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">My younger brother used to come to me and then we spreading, used other people, so we used to disappear from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the duration of that visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  Tell me what your parents knew about what you were doing and what they thought?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Well, my parents, of course, they knew that I was involved in something, especially early in 1939 and early 1940 because some strangers were coming, people they didn't know from my organization used to visit me on special assignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I used to disappear for a number of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So, naturally at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there were always questions, where have you been. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">You better watch out. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">This is not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You'll have to pay for this one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So, they knew quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Of course, I wasn't going to tell them the details, obviously I am involved and I should actually -- you should give me your blessings not to criticize me on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">My parents understood and they were 100 percent behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">My father, naturally, was very much affected by what was going on because the Gestapo used to come a couple of times a month, at the beginning especially, and they used to call him and they used to ask him questions about my activities before I got arrested, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They wanted to simply to coordinate things which they know with what was happening, but of course, my father didn't tell them anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But he paid, with his health forms, because this was too much tension, too much aggravation, and he was suffering from some heart problems, and eventually he had a heart attack in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He couldn't take it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So, that was -- my mother survived, she was probably physically stronger and was able to survive that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Tell me about your arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Why were you arrested, do you think, in 1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  After the war, I met some of my friends, we used to work together in those <span class="REGION">areas</span> and they told-- nobody knew exactly why. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Of course, there were notes that men with my age, my background, he will be involved in something so why not take him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">At least it will be quiet here. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">This is a trouble maker, a typical trouble maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Get rid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Let's get rid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I had all kinds of ideas and thoughts, especially when I was interrogated in <span class="BUILDING">Prison</span> , by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">At one point, the man in charge of the interrogations said "Listen, don't be stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">We know everything about you, about your activities, particularly you did a very bad thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">You helped Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You issued 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">cards to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">In that next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , next <span class="DLF">door</span> here, is a group of Jews, young fellows from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shedoweouf</span> who told me everything about you, how many cards you issued. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Just tell me and we'll finish this," he tried to be funny, "I'm sure you'll like to go rest a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Iam tired myself, so let's have it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I said, "No, I don't know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But I was seriously shaken by that, that next <span class="DLF">door</span> he had a couple of Jews that could support his suspicion. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But I said no, definitely no. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I don't know anybody Jews, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Don't bother me about Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I hate Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">There was nobody next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Nobody, no Jews, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was just one of his tricks, trying to get something out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">They repeated the same thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because the case was continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That was say about July 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They moved us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Of course, the file went with me as a case, not like any other average prisoner, but a prisoner with a case of helping Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They used to call me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> a couple of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I got a little Chinese torture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but of course, nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I didn't tell them anything because I knew for sure that that was bologna. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They didn't have those particular people that we helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So I was sort of secure as far as this was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> there in , they interrogated you on and off during that whole three month period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Membership in the illegal organization, underground organization and banditry, and helping Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  When they interrogated you they tortured you and they threatened you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  Yes, well it started with a simple beating with a rubber hose down in on my behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">That was an opening in each case, it was just a little introduction. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Then you get up, one guy was particularly interested, a powerful man, he used to hit me in my ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">He liked my right ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">He used to hit me so many times and of course I don't hear any more in that ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">That was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Then another interesting approach was to put my fingers into the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">They used to squeeze, ask me question and press the <span class="DLF">door</span> to try to close it. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Naturally it destroyed, I used to play violin, as I probably mentioned before, and after that, even after I recovered reasonably well, I couldn't play violin because I had no touch here in those three fingers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And of course I lost three or four teeth, that was in , and they beat my -- another, beating testicles. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They used that at the beginning of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I remember that because when the preparation for a transport for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> came my testicles were the size of a soccer ball and when we were in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> waiting to move to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I couldn't move because it was so heavy I had to hold my hand like a basketball or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">They were very swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I thought I would probably die on my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but somehow I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I, not at first, with all this I went to it's not exactly a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> but something like first aid station. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So, they gave me some pills and they sent me to work naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I was able to -- I met a friend from my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and he was working at that particular first aid station, and he helped me to get into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for my testicles to perform some surgery or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  Was he Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  No, he was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He got me into that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they performed I think they call it puncture (ph) or something, drawing that fluid or infection, that subsided a bit but I had always trouble with this <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in what did they say if you had given up and given them information, did they say they would release you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  No, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  So, you knew if you talked you would be killed anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Well, besides, that was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I was prepared to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">There was no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Things were going very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So, when I was so sick, what's the difference, you die today or in a week, or two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I was very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Infection here, infection in the back, my kidneys were not working right. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The fingers are bothering me. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I'm not hearing nothing, so what's the use. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Here I lost two or three teeth in , later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I lost another four, so what's the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  When you knew that you were going to be taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> did you know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  How did you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  It was a very well known fact in the underground press actually there were some people taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on previous occasions from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , so they stayed there for a month or two maybe and all of a sudden a notification would come that he got a heart attack or something like that, he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So, I knew, of course, with the background with the underground papers, we knew everything, what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">In may cases that meant just the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  So, tell me how you got transported there and how you got registered there and you were in a <span class="DLF">block</span> with other political prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Well, there was a mixture, well, when I arrived there naturally you have to see a show, they produced for you, not so much Germans, but the prisoners in many cases are criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We had red triangle, they had green triangle, mostly German criminals and some of them -- in most cases German criminals they got the best jobs there were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">You know, like copo, or block elder stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So, everytime a transport came, they used to show what they know what they can do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">With of course a huge sticks they used to beat everybody and I mean first of all there was the that means the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There were some unbelievable things going there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">A lot of beatings an stuff.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  No, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">In that particular -- you see every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is detailed, is marked, the date. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The reason I know is I asked -- they have a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I asked for a certificate to prove that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">On that certificate it says 1t was a transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiertza</span> (ph), and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">In other words, there was a number of people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It could have been Jews because there was plenty of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Why not, there could have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I don't really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">At that time I was not aware of what was going on ten feet from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I was sick and just looking around and trying to escape as many blows as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">It was quite an experience, but of course, thank God this was done by the criminals, not political prisoners, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">That's what you expect from that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  So initially you went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and then when you recovered what happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  They sent us right away to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">In that <span class="REGION">area</span> , there was not very much to do there except, I don't know what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">There was a group of I don't know, 20 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They could have been ten Russians, five Jews, a Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , oh my God, skeletons really, three or four Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">About twenty of us, and he told us to push a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> on the rails, usually for <span class="BUILDING">constructions building</span> and stuff to move building materials, stones or cement, stuff like that, a triangle thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">It was loaded with stones and it was a little bit uphill area, not much, but it was so heavy that with four guys on this side and four on this side and two in the back and we couldn't move that. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So the SS men got crazy, started beating us and I don't know, I was very ambitious, those guys are beaten but everybody was holding this somehow because if you would drop that that the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> would go back because it was a <span class="DLF">down slope</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Finally I show you and he threw everything -- because you can move, everything that was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> goes out, stones and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And I was on that unfortunate side where he put all the stones and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He was a powerful man, a very strong man that he could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Ten of us couldn't do it, he could do it himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And again, unfortunate thing, everything went on my right foot and it was completely destroyed, damaged, some nerves and the muscles. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Everything was damaged severely and to this very day, I have some loss of muscles and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I never recovered from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It's another souvenir from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And of course, the foot was black and blue for a number of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I could hardly move, but I had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But that was the basically that's what I got from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  In the time that you were working, you were also questioned again in connection with your --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">In the very beginning for about, I don't remember, about three times maybe I was called to a so-called polishok tilo ,(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="528">That's the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">That's where my file was. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">They asked me similar questions from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiertze</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Anything new? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Did you change your mind, because if you changed your mind we'll be very generous and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We'll appreciate this. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I said, "No, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">How can I tell you, I don't know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But later on, there was --the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was getting a little bit disorganized. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">In the meantime, there was an uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Some Jewish commander, those fellows who took care of new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , transports of Jews, preparation for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , there was one very well very selected group of Jews, young Jews, healthy, strong, good looking Jews, and they used to work on that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  Did you know about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  I knew about it because the <span class="REGION">area</span> where they were running -- they tried to escape, was not very far from <span class="REGION">area</span> where I used to work, my commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And, one afternoon we just saw something. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There was a lot of noise, shooting, and you can distinguish guns and some noises not very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It could have been less than a mile away, much less. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So,we knew that something was going on, and we found -- and of course, once this happened, everybody is going back in the middle of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Forget about work and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They form the columns and you go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , because that's a dangerous situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They were not sure what was happening at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">If the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is going to start a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So our guards, SS men, they drove us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as fast as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They were behaving like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We knew it was something and then when we arrived they told us what happened.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  All the friends, the prisoners, <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We had some connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I mean later on I developed -- I knew some people that had underground organizations, connection with the outside life and they're quite well organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They helped people to escape, were very seldom successful, but they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">That was the assignment they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And eventually prepare for a little uprising as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">the situation was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">That was late. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">The Russians were moving like crazy from the East. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They were very close to the -- they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> not very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So, the camp commander, they didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So, they decided to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> gradually, and that's how I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graustroiten</span> (sp).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Once you were out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they helped you get a little better, you were in a <span class="DLF">block</span> with the German criminals and political prisoners or what was your <span class="DLF">block</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  It was a mixture. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I would say it was mostly Jews and percentage wise, I don't know, 70 percent Jews, 10 percent Russians, the rest Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The Russians --whatever was left, they were destroyed a couple of years before I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">There were just behaving like animals, the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They were destroying themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We used to work on the damaged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , German, American, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They used to bring to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we used to take the good parts from that, and of course they wanted to save that, from the inside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> from the motor. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">In many cases, there was a special kind of alcohol but strictly for the function of the operation of the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">For some parts of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , steering, I believe it was a combination of oil, alcohol, of course alcohol for consumption. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But the Russians, once they found that this was alcohol, they started drinking that and I witnessed myself, once during their lunch break they drank that alcohol and they died in terrible pains, because you know it was a poison and acted immediately after they drank it. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But of course, they had a good time before. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I saw it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I remember that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> about I think it could have been October, the beginning of October to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> , and we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">SS organized a commando because "tza legga bat reiber" (ph) going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> , just like a <span class="DLF">subdivision</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">It's not at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> itself, the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it was like a branch or something like that, not very far from the center. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Anyway, it was a subdivision, or subbranch or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">We were there until I'm not sure February I think of 1945.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  The reason was because the Russians were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">They were very successful in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">There was very heavy fighting at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sylitzea</span> (ph), the Polish part and the German part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stylitzea</span> (ph), and there was some very important battles going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Of course, they didn't wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They wanted to remove as many people as possible from those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And they were times that you could hear the artillery, shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">One day more, one day less, anyway they decided to move us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Then, did you work there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Yes, something not very, nothing specific. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">There were all kinds of jobs like cleaning, sweeping, light jobs, because there was already a disorganization. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The camp commander didn't know what to do and we were trying to organize some secret defense group. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I came across some Polish communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They used to be participating in Spanish civil war, and they were -- but of course involved from the very beginning was created by Hitler for communists, German communists and communists from all over the <span class="REGION">area</span> from the <span class="REGION">European scene</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Those guys were very well organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and very well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They had good food, because top management were communists_ so they took care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">In April, when we arrived there -- before the beginning of April they started looking for people, able bodied people with some military experience who would be willing to participate in a little fighting with the SS people, soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But, so I agreed to participate in that, but nothing came from that, because there was not enough, they were promised weapons and they never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Something like that, nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">In the meantime, I believe, April 7, he decided to organize the evacuation, not of everybody, but of a large group of prisoners from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchnwald</span> , and he moved even the first part I remember went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaminetyz</span> (ph) by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaminetyz</span> (ph) there were Americans started bombarding the transportation communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It was completely disrupted, so we could no longer go south using the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so we had to go by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So, everybody out, and march, south. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Possibly, two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , but later on we found out that it wasn't supposed to be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , it was supposed to be a place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> in nice beautiful picturesque <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , they prepared the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and everything, they were going to liquidate a whole group. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">But of course they couldn't make it because George Patton was first. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He liberated us the twenty- first of April, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I remember exactly, a 11th tank division, and I met some people there I used to exchange letters for number of years after that, soldiers, Polish soldiers, Polish American soldiers and the picture that you have in my story, it was taken by him. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">The whole group we arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">That was roughly the end of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  You say you knew in 1943 what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but a lot of Polish Jews didn't know what was happening when they were transported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Do you think you knew because of the underground?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Important thing is this. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> because they started with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was originally for Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So, a vast majority of prisoners were Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">In the year of 1940, '41, '42, it was absolute majority. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Later on they decided to enlarge the <span class="DLF">field</span> , the area of activity so they started <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , if I remember correctly, was mostly for the Jews, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as such the majority of the prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were Poles, but things were changing all the time, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , the prisoners from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were working on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">When I arrived in 1943, there was still construction going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">It wasn't finished, not everything was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So that's the reason that Jews were not aware of actual -- the Auschwitz place. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They were more aware of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  And a lot of them didn't know even when they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> usually?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I remember when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I talked to some Hungarian Jews, that was 1944, in the summer, a huge transport of Hungarian Jews came, and I remember that we had some good times because a lot of good food came with them and our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was using rice, my God, what rice. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">We were -- and they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">They told them that they were going to a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> , secluded, and you will be able to work until the end the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Nothing is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Of course, give us your valuable and everything because we have to maintain a certain comfort for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">You have to live like people, like human beings, so nothing to worry about. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">They did the same with Czechoslovakian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">They did the same with Hungarian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They did the same with Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They were my neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I knew I saw them, Hungarian Jews experience very badly because they were burning them day and night, day after day. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It was unbelievable smell, and of course we had a better soup, but my God nobody could eat that soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">But that was terrible, really, summer of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  The punishment for collaborators, if the AK found out what then happened, and tell me about your specific knowledge of specific cases?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Well, the organization was the smallest unit, was I don't know how it was equivalent to a post which would be corresponding to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Several posts would be a <span class="REGION">county</span> , more or less corresponding to a <span class="REGION">county</span> and several <span class="REGION">counties</span> again, would be like a <span class="REGION">district</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">On our level, it was the smallest unit in the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Of course, we had a division of activities was first of all the military activities which included training and preparation for a specific assignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Collecting of weapons, ammunition, maintenance, and that will be the military part, as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Then would be a part like a diversion of sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Sabotage would have to perform certain tasks, disruption of communication in general or in particular cases according to the situation, according to the needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It would be run, usually by soldiers, former soldiers who used to be on active duty in Polish Army, because they used to be most of the time Junior Officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Then there would be the political side of it which would be the distribution of press or preparation of future needs of future administration, organizing of future councils which would be planning supply in case of uprising, would be in charge of preparation of food, supplies of food or medications, <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , but there was a unit also that took care of unfriendly acts of some people who were cooperating with the German authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">It could be done in various ways, the most common in situation would be to report some experiences some SS acts, some facts to Gestapo as an act of well loyalty I would say to Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">For some stupid reason he would discover that he was loyal to the German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He started to cooperate with them and he would be reporting all kinds of trespassers like , with the collection of food by farmers, stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">He would be sabotaging deliveries, so this is -- he would be reporting to Germans all kinds of irregular activities in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , engaged in which actually were in the interest of Polish population, so these people were not too friendly to Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So, I remember two or three cases that one case was a policeman of Polish nationality who was too eager to please German police, and he hurt so much Polish people, that he was reported to higher authorities, the underground Polish authorities, and the accusations were collected and facts were collected and he was executed in due course. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">A similar situation was with another Pole that also was cooperating with German authorities, but not on a more or less on an economical level, like smuggling, stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Smuggling was an important part, because a lot of people depended on smuggled food because the official quota that you got of food was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">In certain circumstances you have to smuggle, or in many cases they were doing this for gain, but it was a necessary fact, necessary activity for the benefit of Polish population in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So if somebody was trying to disrupt this or report some activities of smugglers to German police, the act was unfriendly and if it continued for a number of occasions, so the guy deserved a penalty and in that particular case that I remember, that guy was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Of course, a due course of law was applied to that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">There were certain underground jurist, lawyers, judges, of course not employed by the current German administration, but they were original members of Polish jurisdiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So, they were knowledgeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They knew the law and they were able to issue a proper decision based on their experience and knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">One case I know also, a third case, a Jew who was very friendly with the German police also reporting all kinds of activities to German police and he was I understand the story, he was warned several times not to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He was even warned by some Jewish -- as a matter of fact, his family were telling him to stop that nonsense, but of course he was hoping that this way he will be able to survive, and his family, and so he was also killed.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I don't -- you see for me I would have to if things like that took place of similar nature, it was probably after I was arrested because a lot of activities -- I mean the situation was getting more active in the second half of 1943 and the beginning of '44, and I was no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I don't know, and frankly from people that I know, from those days, there was no such a thing as 1n a group, in a small group, not many Jews were participating, but if there were and I know of one from a friend of mine, there was not anything anti-semitic about that particular, I think 1t was two brothers or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">They were visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">They were visiting a friend a mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">He had a huge <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> they were able to come to that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> were they were members. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They used to come, they used to take some food for the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">My friend trusted them, and they trusted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">They even used to have a radio receiver. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">They used to listen to the broadcast from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , together, in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , that particular <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was those two Jews and this friend of mine, and they were very close to that particular partisan group and there was nothing unfriendly because I think they knew each other when they were very small children, like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They were more or less of the same age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  Now, going back to the deportation from you <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , after all the Jews were deported was the Jewish population the majority?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  Yes, it was majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  So, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was sort of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghost town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  For a little while, yes, but the vacancies you may say were filled by Polish people who were deported from the area of the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">There were some people rom the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">There were also in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , very rich area as far as agriculture was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They were very good, very rich farmers so Germans decided to deport them and put some German people mostly I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">In other words, German born people so because they were deported from or simply they asked for better conditions, better kind of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They expected that from Hitler because we're doing some small -- maybe I'll say it was quite a common thing, many of them were spying for Germans before the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">For a number of years they were in touch with German intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They were collecting intelligence for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">So, if the guy was not to rich, just average, small farmer or something if he was able to get a <span class="DLF">farm</span> like in that <span class="REGION">Lublin area</span> , SO he was very glad to do that, to take over that <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And the Poles from that <span class="REGION">area</span> , from the entire family was sent to small places like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shedowoeuf</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="801">There was not very much they could do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">They were completely destroyed, poor people with their children and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">So they did some, maybe I don't remember exactly what they did, maybe they were just common laborers or something like that but they took over the possessions or <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> originally occupied by Jews who were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I know a case of a guy he was a living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> (ph) before the war and when the war came, he was no longer they simply told him go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">We don't want you here because this is German reich and we need only 100 percent Germans here. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">So, he was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">He was an intelligent guy, he was a professional, some sort of an engineer or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So, he got one of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> originally owned by Jews not as a property just as administration, management, for the management and he was paid as a manager of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">QUESTION:  Did any of the Jews that were deported come back after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">ANSWER:  I wouldn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I think maybe, but I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I was in touch with my friends after the war, but the first time I came to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shadoweouf</span> (ph) was last year, for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">You know, I could recognize that <span class="NPIP">place</span> because number one, there was very heavy fighting, the Russians were fighting with Germans in 1945 in the beginning when the main offensive was moving from the East to the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Everything was destroyed, so now everything 1s rebuilt and the people maybe here or there I could recognize somebody, but it's very, very difficult to. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Nobody really knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">New people, new faces, new <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , like a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  Now, can you just tell me just very short what your losses were in your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  Well, I mean the reason my father died is absolutely the reason I was arrested and the Gestapo was trying to interrogate him many times and that's how he paid with his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">He had a heart problem and that's why he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">My cousin died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">My uncle, my father's brother, died in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">He was in the Polish police before the war and according to the American Red Cross, I just got the news last year that he was liquidated let's say, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp was</span> liquidated by the KGB in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="823">My brother, younger brother during the hostilities, during there was a fierce battle in January of 1945 between Russians and Germans, so they were running scared and he just got married, he married that the one in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , she used to be our contact, and they had a little child, and in January he had to cross -- running away from the Russians, he had to cross a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , but anyway it was deep enough that it was up to his neck with the child carrying the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">So, after that he got pneumonia and he died shortly after that and the child died also. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">The youngest brother he spent some time, I don't know exactly, but close to a year in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I met him after the war when we independently joined the Polish Armed Forces in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I met him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">But he told me that he had a very tough time to survive that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and he got a problem with his heart also. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">But he was okay for a number of years, but complaining of his heart all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">One day, and he settled down in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">He married an English girl and I think they had three children and he was driving one day and he got a heart attack while driving and here a collision head on with another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he was wounded very badly because of that heart condition, the heart attack, and he didn't recover from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">He died shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">So, I considered this part of the war also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  We only have a very few minutes left and I want if you can for you to describe for me the deportation that you watched from the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , if you can?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Well, the idea was to assemble everybody on that <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">The younger people were able reasonably healthy people on the average, they were able to get there with their belongings, not much, small things necessary for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Probably they had their most valuable things on them, but anyway, the younger group could make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So, they were assembled around that <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> and they were waiting for the older generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">But with older people it's a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So, some of them could walk and some of them could not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Some of them were sick, simply sick in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , so these people as I know from after everything was finished, they were killed on the spots by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">He couldn't walk, so he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Because later on the abandoned <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , had to be cleaned and the dead bodies had to be removed because it was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So, I saw a couple of dead bodies when they were cleaning that. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">There was a whole crew cleaning the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and mostly for middle age sick people or very old people, there was no chance, so they were either left in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , dead, or in that <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> were shot, because they couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Also, a lot of people who were sick on that march between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shedoweuf</span> (ph) and which is I don't know about 18 miles, it was impossible for them to make it, so the older people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">There were lots of dead bodies on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So that's what we prepared in the report to our authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">We mentioned as far as I remember it the idea was it was butchery, senseless because they simply acted like animals and they just left so much destruction and fear because everybody was psychologically -- the Polish people were very very worried after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I told you that the young people stopped living at their usual places of residence. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They left the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Most of them went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to join the partisan groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Others were just moving to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> under assumed names with forged 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">That's how it started, terror, uncertainty, fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  You're welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  I'm sorry to put you through so much.</span></p>
