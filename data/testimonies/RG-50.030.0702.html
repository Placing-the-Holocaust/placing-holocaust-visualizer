<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Yes, I went back a few years ago, and that was also a big, you know, blow to my memory, but I did find <span class="BUILDING">Villa Jaime</span> where I was born, and I did find the <span class="DLF">park</span> , and the places we went swimming, and <span class="BUILDING">Principe Umberto</span> , which I remember as being this huge <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was broken up into different <span class="NPIP">parts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But the general atmosphere, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">palm trees</span> , and the beauty of the little <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  Doesn't mean your memory was wrong; it just means life changed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Yeah, it just was distorted, and even though it's <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , you know, people still speak Italian there. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Many <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> still have Italian headings, and so the -- you know, the Croatian government now is making it -- you know, is resuscitating the allure of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  Did your grandchildren express interest in what had gone on with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  Not that much really. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">You know, they ask questions every now and then, but they never, you know, never explored. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But my brother has some tapes, but, you know, he is not here anymore, and he lives in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  Well, it's at the core of me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I think it made me who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">It made me strong and flexible, and it's something I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It's a history that, you know, that will be with me forever, even though it's kind of not always there, you know, on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  No, I mean they know bits and pieces, you know, but it's not something that my parents dwelled on, and I think that that's some kind of a pattern of people who have gone through a lot, that they don't really talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  So were you reluctant to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  Well, you know, I mean once I realized the importance of it, you know, but it's not something that is spontaneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  Got that. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I've got that. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Is there something -- excuse me for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Is there something that I haven't asked about that we haven't discussed that you think is pertinent to all, to our subject today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Well, you know, I had asked my daughter, because she has all the names of the people that -- my uncles and aunts that, that didn't survive, and so many cousins, and that, you know, that I think my brother, when he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I think inscribed their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I'm not so positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">But she was at work when I called her this morning, and she didn't have it with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  So you would want to have those names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  Yes, I would like to add them to, you know, the victims' list if they are not there yet, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I don't know if the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has them or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  I don't know, but when she finds the names, and if they are sent to me, I will forward that to the people who handle those, those data bases, and see that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  But I do want to say that of all the people in Europe, the Italians were probably the most noble and life savers than any other nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">The people, not so much the institutions, like the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , but the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They did not turn anybody in. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Maybe there were a few cases that I don't know of that I'm sure, but they were the most civil of, you know, of all the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  You have touched on a subject that I think sometimes is very, very important and one of the losses that so many people had who had different experiences, that very often part of the experience a person went through, if they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or if they were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or they were in an <span class="REGION">area</span> further north, is that neighbors that they knew

<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  That wasn't part of what your experience was then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Well, I used to somehow wonder, you know, why so many innocent people had to die for what, you know, but I still have faith, and as the Italians, you know, proved, there 1s, you know, hope for humanity yet.</span></p>
