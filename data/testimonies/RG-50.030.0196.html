around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , moved into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">There was eighteen people in that <span class="BUILDING">bungalow</span> of three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">No...the <span

class="DLF">windows</span> in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We couldn't go in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Only in the back. </span><span class="sentence"

what we needed and we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My mother had...we had, you know, corn and beet and potatoes, everything at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so later on I...one day I was cleaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was my time to clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Then every week somebody else cleaned, and this were my week to clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was cleaning and then I hear some shots <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I didn't know what. </span><span

class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You are buried in the in the side of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , so they make a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> , a very big <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was a hundred and fifty people together in that <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The night was beautiful, and I said God, where are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I was thinking and looking up...I said oh God. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">What nice living could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Why

</span><span class="sentence" id="138">We were good citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Anyway, then was talking there will be aktion again because they were afraid, the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The the men, the nine men start to dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the uh...not in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> ...in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , a <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">A big <span class="DLF">hole</span> under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , so we can go in hiding under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They finished the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Later on we saw our uh wood was...the the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was the rest painted, so the paint came out and we was afraid maybe the German would see. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Ah... the Juden. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">the Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Then they decided they will go in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where the chicken koop, under the chicken koop. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They open a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> and they put the chicken, you know, on the big <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They they cover up the <span class="DLF">hole</span> with straw, nothing else, and they figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It was two o'clock at night they did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Two o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They carried the the the, you know, the sand and the the dirt all on the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> , and they were for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And we'll cover our back in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and we went again in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">stall</span> we went...1t was on a Tuesday...I remember very well...all of a sudden they say the German are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The German are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And we didn't know what's happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We right away went. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The <span class="DLF">front door</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The <span class="DLF">front door</span> opened and the <span class="DLF">back door</span> opened, so the Germans would know we are not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">We run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So we spent from nine o'clock till five o'clock in the in the dark and one neighbor's daughter came. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It was too late to take them in and she was...didn't...couldn't go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We closed the the the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , so she got killed from the from the from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was under...1n the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...she got... she was hiding in the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She was thirty years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They kill her on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So five o'clock we go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I was crying, Mother, I lost my bracelet. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I lost my bracelet. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">She said oh my child, my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You'll have lots of bracelets in your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And she said to me, I remember, you know, Fani, remember, she said, that you lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Tell all the people what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Tell everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So we came out from the from the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Oh gosh...no drapes, no dishes to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Everything was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The neighbors came in, the Christian neighbors came in, took everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Our whole world...there's nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But, you know, life must go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Was on a Saturday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, again vandalizing and again the Sabbath keeping and again the religious...they stick their religion to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So the ten days passed again, after the aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was night. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And uh the after this we went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and we bought something from them, you know, and...you know, no schooling, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We couldn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So after the the the aktion, 5 the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="195">We will go to the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolmyja</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But it was a rumor. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We didn't believe it. , </span><span class="sentence" id="198">you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Maybe God will give us who stay here and we go through the war, maybe...maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So one Fniday night, we're sitting at the
