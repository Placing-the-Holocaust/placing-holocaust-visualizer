<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  In addition to the typhus, did you have any other medical problems?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, you know, you are so weak, and in general and you’re really the merak — you are — you are sick all over, I mean, it’s something which I could say, it’s — it’s a miracle thing which people survived after that, because we all were by all miracle, you know, by all — how shall I say — medicine would not help us the way we were looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">No — nothing would have help it, just miracle thing, and — and that’s what happened is the way we pulled through. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Also, you pull through is the will — the will — the willpower to live, and that’s the way it kept us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We were a few people together there and we stick together til things got a little bit better. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And then doctors October 22, 1997 came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Al-All a prisoner of war doctor, all German — German doctors came 1n, in the — although we went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We didn’t leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for awhile, but later on we took [indecipherable] part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and we went in in the German and the <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> , and there start to get a little bit better in general.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Which organizations? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">October 22, 1997
ANSWER:  The — the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">That time was the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So they were a — also I saw — I was very surprise to see also people of the Jewish organizations from <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Of course, I learned about <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">There was a woman soldiers, Jewish girls, women soldiers, speaking Yiddish 1n such a funny accent, I never — never heard something — I couldn’t figure out — even I understand, which I —I didn’t speak any English, I couldn’t understand the way they were talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But m — the products — 1-1t’s too — it was the Joint, but most of the [indecipherable] it — it was written on the can, I— I — I’m a tuna, you know, a gift from the South African Jews, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Johannesburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I could see the label in — in front of my eye, there was written. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And they made us very comfortable over there and they tried to get us further dow — further to — to get to our desin — destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> we took another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Some people — not with the same people, some people, they went on different direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We sto — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> I had very little problem, because Czech, I didn’t speak that language, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> I speak the language, so we didn’t have — we had very little problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Also there was also the Jewish organization like the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I didn’t see the South Africans there, there was only the Joint, the American. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And they took over a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they call it <span class="BUILDING">Adjibat(ph) school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">There was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and the name was Adjibat(ph) and they — there was a lot of food already, <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> over there, setting up. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But you October 22, 1997 couldn’t go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> because they were looking for Nazis, the — the Russians were looking for Nazis so they had the Hungarians with the — going around with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And the — and they know right away, there’s not the — don’t look Hungarian because the way you walk, the way you eat, the way the thing, right away they point it out from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So the Russians gave in the documents that we are re-refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We also got documents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , which I have them right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And the reason I| kept all those documents from wherever I went, they gave us a paper and I kept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I also got the papers from the liberation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> from the U.S. Army, which I have it here in my possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">For all those year, I carried that. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , I went out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I felt like <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know, we went out, we took a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I find one guy which e — he was our neighbor, and he was in the Czech army that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And we walked, we kept on talking, we walk in the <span class="DLF">street</span> there and finally we saw one guy — two — two people, not one, but one guy we recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I said, is it the chief of the police of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">You know what this guy did with him in my — thi — this person who I — I know from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He — first he beat the hell out of him, and the Russians came around, there wa a lot of soldiers, they came around and they seen what’s going on, they didn’t intervene at all, til the guy got ready, and then he s — he says to the Russian, he said, this is the guy, when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the — and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> used to come in October 22, 1997 with potatoes or other kind of food for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so this guy took away all the food, he gave it to the local people and to us, when it — in the bottom on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there was dirt, he said, this is for the Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And then this fellow, the Jewish guy, he picked up the — the Czech soldier and he pu — picked up a lot of dirt from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and he fulled up his mouth, he says, this is the dirt what you told us to eat, now you eat the dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And after a few days, we decided we are going to see whoever’s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It’s about five an — 500 kilometer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">When we got — it was easy to get, you know, the — the traveling that I — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> used to go maybe 20 miles an hour, the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , even the — it was written 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> they go 40 mile, they only go about 20 mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Sometime you could run faster than the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , the way they had those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to our destin — destination, the Oybarishu(ph) Mamurish(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and of course the — it was a very interesting <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">First of all, on the da — this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , before th-they call it Rishu(ph), it was <span class="COUNTRY">Austria-Hungary</span> before the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">On the fir — on the W-World War first after, they — the Romanian took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">In 1940, the Hungarians took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So we were shoved to one — from one to the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">When the Hungarians went — when it was <span class="COUNTRY">Austro-Hungary</span> , that wasn’t a bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, and to — it was pretty good over there, because there was a lot of wood, and the Hungarians, the Austrian didn’t have so much wood, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , so it was not a bad life. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But when October 22, 1997 the Romanian came in, and the Romanian had a lot of wood, so life got deteriorated, it was — it was such a good, I mean, people were suffering a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And when we arrived in the — on the — 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , manufactured was [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with — of three — 4,000 Jews in there before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">When we arrived there, we find a couple of Jewish families in there and we tried to see how we could do something, and tried to build up our lives — put together the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But we really couldn’t make it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We try all kinds of business, we’re trying to bring in <span class="BUILDING">store</span> from one — from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other one, tra — traveling to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , things like this, and the bottom line, we couldn’t make out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  When you came back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , how were you received by your — your neighbors, the non-Jewish community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  We - we really — it wasn’t too bad even before we le — we got along with the Romanians pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> from Romanians, Hungarians, Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We had our own, you know, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German neighborhood</span> , there was Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But really 1-1t wasn’t that bad before the war with those people, we got along pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But th-the — the thing is, with the Germans it was another — another ball game that time because they — they went — they called it [indecipherable] they all went to the German army, they all went to the SS army. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And of course, that was not, you know, good cooperation with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So when I was October 22, 1997 — we — when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viseu</span> , so our first thing, we find our brother in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">He was in the Hungarian army as a laborist. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we find him over there already, but we couldn’t make ends meet over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So I was there with my — my brother Azreal(ph), and I was there with my sister Rose and Raechel(ph) and Gitel. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But the most interested thing, my sister was married before the war, and my brother-in-law came back and they got reunited again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viseu</span> in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So — but there was no more futures because I saw a different type of life after, whenever you travel one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the other one, and the life in — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was so backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So there was really nothing more we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So we made preparation. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We tried to sell thing, but to who you gonna sell? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Because when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was robbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They took everything away, the local people. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Even we got along with them nice, but they still, you know, they still tried to get something for nothing and they came down — they used to live out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they came down in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they occupied all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> in there, and it was no life whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So our mind was just to get out of there, and to see what we could start up new.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, there — some more people came in 1n our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we tried to find out if the — 1f — 1f maybe they could find out where my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We didn’t know he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , we had — couldn’t find out what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Then there was a barber, he was a avrum(ph) de barbera(ph) they called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He was a very good friend my father, and then he told us the tragedy what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">My father knows horses, and he had a friend, he was working in a <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> , and due to the fact there was a very good combination, and the Germans give him the

class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> right, and my father and his friend Drogas(ph), th-they both got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And it was the first day of Chol HaMoed Pesach, and that’s the day we are keeping the Yahrzeit, because we know exactly what the day and — and the Yahrzeit for my mother, my sister, we keep the first day of when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that was [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And we — it’s actually picked a day, because we don’t know exactly when they went to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , but according to the rabbi, they told us that when you arrived, that’s the day that you gotta keep the Yahrzeit. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But therein — then, after we find out about our father, so there were no more hope in there, and no more thing, so try to go back from where we came, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , we know we have family in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and other family in other areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So we tried to go October 22, 1997 back because we already heard that they have there DP camps they opened in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So we go in in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> from there probably we’ll be able to go into our — another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because we have nothing to do any more in here, it’s all washed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Now, going back wasn’t so easy, it was very hard to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">First of all, we had to have money to travel, you couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We had a few things, but we hardly got anything for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So we start traveling, we went back to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they call it [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We went over there with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">From there we had to go in on the — to the <span class="REGION">Czechoslovakia side</span> again, in the Allneek(ph) Javorkt(ph) <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We went — they shouldn’t catch us, the Russian, because if they catch you, they were controlled with Russian, [indecipherable] Russian they get you, then like they said, they take you to Siberia(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">From there we had to cut into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , also during the day — it was summer — during the day we were sitting on the high grasses, lay down over there, because there was a lot of Russian patrols, and a lot of them got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And then we went, little by little, til we arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and when we arrived there, also we — they caught us, because a lot of people, they were talking, and you’re not supposed to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And they — that time was the corn harvest, we were sitting in there, and at night we start running again. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We — we went one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we October 22, 1997 had a few dollars that time, we sold something. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And there was a guy who used to take over from — who took over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> there with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , something [indecipherable] from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">one</span> , so we gave him a few dollar, he took us over in the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , on the <span class="REGION">Hungarian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And then we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> will go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Now also that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was so full of people, local people, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> what to put nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We also find out that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> has no salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">There’s no salt over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So we took a few bags of salt, and we — to take it back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , because that was a big commodity over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Oh, actually, the salt we had for nothing, because Romanian had so much salt, which it was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">When we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we also had to go on the <span class="DLF">slate roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We had to go on the <span class="DLF">slate roof</span> and lay down there, you know, to keep on going, which it took a few days from one <span class="NPIP">area</span> til we are — til we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Now who was there? </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It was there was my brother Areal(ph) and again my older sister with her husband, they remained behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They — they decided they not ready to go back yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So it was my other two sister, my brother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So we stood on that <span class="DLF">slate roof</span> over there, also the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Well, it f— we f-— first of all, we talked about families, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And when we went in in — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , we didn’t know what happened, we didn’t know what’s going on, anyhow, til we were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So everybody used to tell the story, I was there, I was there, and one guy says, oh I was there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I says, I was in the same <span class="DLF">block</span> and I couldn’t rec — I didn’t even know he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And the main [indecipherable] the whole thing you want to know 1s all just <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , just <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to get the land of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to get to our own <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Also, at the first time, and it was a holiday, it was Passover at that time, and there was the <span class="BUILDING">Austrian station</span> , the [indecipherable] radio station, and the first time we heard Yiddish speaking on the <span class="BUILDING">Austrian radio station</span> to wish us happy, healthy holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And it was one of the October 22, 1997 greatest things to — to hear a Jewish voice f-from, you know especially in — in Austrian, Na-Nazi land, and — yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  When did you begin to realize just how much the Jewish people had suffered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  Soon — soon you went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , when we went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and you see the Jewish people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">You know, you could have see people, you know, putting on the twill and stuff, praying over there, and then from the back he got shot because he’s putting on twill, something like this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And October 22, 1997 another — the — stay there and they pick up their hands and pray to God to come a miracle, they got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">The miracle was they got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So you could see your own Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Look, I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I wouldn’t change my religion if you killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Even I went through all the prosecution thing, whatever they did to me, it — I like very much where I am, but [indecipherable] we have our own — our own thing between the extremists and the thing, so 1-it’s not such a good idea, I think we should get a little more better united than [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">In case God forbid something like this comes around, we should be united, which we were not united those days, because there were too extreme, and they all — and they forced us to be extreme and we didn’t — we didn’t feel like being extreme, we just wanted to be good Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And little by little starts up and [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  What you were just saying, was that a reference to before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Yes, before the war, when we were kids, the religion was so strong, they force you to do things, which you didn’t even feel like doing all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Because they were so afraid you gon — you not — you gonna be a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I think that was the wrong way to force somebody to be a Jew, because you have to be the extreme way. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">You could be a go — a good Jew, and you could be Jew in your heart, and — and not to be the extreme way, to be — to God and to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">For God and for [indecipherable] you know, you have to be both ways, you cannot do things in one October 22, 1997 way. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And we suffered a lot for that, because we were not united, even those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">When I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , they told me I’m gonna be a goy, I’m not gonna be a Jew after all, I wanted to come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I had be just in — in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> over there, where you could grow up a good Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The misery was so bad in there, there was no food, there was no nothing, but the religion was on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">First the religion, and then it came the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">No, it wa — it was very hard to — and then you could see what’s going on, you know, and you have different idea, you think different, and — and the problem arrived little by little.</span></p>

And you were telling me about the decision to come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and let’s go with how you got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  After I was in the — in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , camp name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reidenburg</span> , we prepared, you know, I mean people start moving out, they start going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , start going to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">A lot of visas came in from almost all over the <span class="REGION">western world</span> , that they take in so many people, so many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And due to the fact my aunt, she wrote us we should come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> first, so of course you have to prepare yourself to come to the State to see, because like my aunt said, so few were left of her — of my sister’s children, I would like very much you should come here first, but then you make your <span class="NPIP">destination</span> further. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So we start preparing to do — come to the — the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">There was a lot of visas you could go in any other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , like my brother-in-law went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And I had friends, they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">They went all over the world, but my aim was now the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> they did not take people yet to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So we heard in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> this — it’s a faster quota there, you could go faster from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We went some friends and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So, it October 22, 1997 — it didn’t go so smooth either. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We had to — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> — this is <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , to go over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was already independent, and they had the — watching the <span class="DLF">border</span> there, and a — soldier were there and we were trying to go over the <span class="DLF">border</span> , they caught us a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">That’s why I will never forget those Italian that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They caught us twice, and due to the fact I speak Romanian, and it wasn’t too much a — of a differential for the Italian, so I start talking to the guy, he ask me, where you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I says, I’m — I’m looking for a be — a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I’m looking for the — to settle myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">He say, you want to settle <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I says, no, I have an aunt in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">He says, okay, but right now what we have to do with you guy, we have to send you back, because that’s the rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And next time we’ll see. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It just happened, the guards there, they saw what’s coming, and they turn around the other way and they say, Avanti! </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Avanti! </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Avanti! </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So we went over the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Meran</span> , not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Meran</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">This is then the northern part between <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So we went into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Of course, the Joint was there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Meran</span> they made arrangements, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And also they had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, only transit. </span><span class="sentence" id="562"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Meran</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So they, from there we sh — we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> not f-far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Meran</span> , they called it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chiari</span> after, October 22, 1997 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chiari</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">In that they had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> already established to go to is — to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to go to any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It was a faster — you know, faster — you get visa much faster over there to go wherever you gonna go. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So I was in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chiari</span> for a little while, and then I heard that if you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , it’s much faster from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , it took all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were going a little faster than in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , so we went all night, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which it was the — you could have stayed there and there’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there, but there was another <span class="NPIP">place</span> not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , they called it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trani</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And we went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it also was about five hours or so with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trani</span> over there, and we stood there for a little while, a f— months already. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The whole thing took a year and a half or something like this, wh-what I’m telling you, between <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So when it came, there was a delegation over there, and they start taking all the refugee people to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Now, it wasn’t so easy to come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">First of all, you had to go through from he — head to tail, they — they checked you out. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Well, they checked out you in general, and they find out — and they wanted to know if you have anybody sponsoring you. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And wanted to know if you have a trade and the feeling, and all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And how intelligent you are, they showed something to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And in books, something to figure out numbers like they do it for children now, they put it October 22, 1997 one, two, thr-three together. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I did put them — I could put them all together because the colors were so funny, I could put them together. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So the bottom line, everything was set, and it — did they come that we are ready to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So from there, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We stood there for a little while, I think they had some kind of a strike that time, so we hanged out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And — and then finally we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , we had [indecipherable] a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> — matter of fact, they just brought some soldiers over to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was empty to go back, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ’s name was General Greely. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So we went in in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in there, and of course, after being so hungry all those years, I was watching to eat because I shouldn’t get sick again. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But I— I was always hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Matter of fact, I’m even hungry now. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I mean, I cannot full myself up from those bad days. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So I went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , we went in there and right away I volunteer to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Because wherever I went in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I made some money in the — all those <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I stood, I always look for a— sometimes I worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they paid, because the Italian government paid for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So I had some money and tell you, the first time I saw what life is when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">First of all, the people were so nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It’s a different type of people over there, and so friendly and generous. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And I had money, and I never know how to live, and this — that’s — tell you, this I — I know this 1s the best life what I ever had up til now, because all the — matter of fact, we went into — the October 22, 1997 government was so nice in general to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We went in, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , and there was a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> playing that time in this [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I went in there and th-there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> whatsoever, but due to the fact we told them we are — we are fr — refugees, so — which I speak the language already. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We are refugees, so right away they made us at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they took us in there to see the opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And I was not much interested in opera thing, so I walked right out the other way, you know, they shouldn’t see me, they made so much effort to get me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And there was other <span class="NPIP">places</span> which I was interested and they gave us so much respect for the — because we were refugee, profugo they called it, we are refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Matter of fact, a lot of time you could have go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> free because they know you are a refugee, and what you went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So finally we go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , General Greely. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I said — they ask volunteers, I went to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , where the food is. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So I went to work in there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and I was doing — in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> I traveled around from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">one</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I went to a lot of <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pompeii</span> , I went to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I went to see, you know, all the old <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Assisi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Well, ha — you name it, I went all over <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to see, because I had an opportunity to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And the third day I got so sick, I got so sick with all the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Matter of fact, it’s not only me, the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Everybody got sick October 22, 1997 [indecipherable] throw all the food around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But I have some friends, they live now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> on — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And just a couple of guys, they were standing there and they were laughing [indecipherable] and then nothing affected them whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So it took a few days pass the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capri</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And a few days after we come to ourselves you know, and we start acting a little bit normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , it was some kind of a storm, and you could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , you know, th-the plates in the — in the — in the <span class="INT_SPACE">mess hall</span> where people were eating, you see, while they were eating, the soup was going one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other one, it was going back and forth with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and rockling the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And finally we come to our desti — destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We c — we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Now
QUESTION:  I want to ask you what expectations you had for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> before you came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Well, I had —I figured I have a trade, which it didn’t do much good in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because they were doing different, but I had a start. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And th-the whole thing was in my head just to settle down and — and to start living like a human being, not to travel around all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So when I arrived in the — 1n the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they — we came straight in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I could never find out where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> landed, it was in December 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I could never find out which <span class="DLF">harbor</span> it come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I October 22, 1997 wanted to go see the — really the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Soon I walked down, there was a lot of organization, there was Christian organization, other organization waiting for their refugees, because in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was not only Jewish people, because there was refugees from — almost from all the <span class="REGION">Eastern Bloc</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Some refugees were fr — they were Russians, from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">They were Polish, but they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Some refugees [indecipherable] they run away from the Germans, and some of them they run away from the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I don’t know what kind of a people, what their background was, what their pol — politic was, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">They were screened in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> before they came, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So they — those organizations right away we had — like I had something written HIAS in my shirt, some people had different organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So we had to go to the — each group. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Matter of fact, I walked over to a Christian organization, I didn’t know what’s all about, and then — and the — the woman was so nice, he says, no, he says, the Jude organization is right across on the other side on the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So when I came over, the HIAS on <span class="DLF">Lafayette Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> had already established for refugees who came over from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board and they were looking for jobs for them, they took us downtown to the — in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I forgot the — the — the — the <span class="DLF">street</span> over there, where they took us in there, and — and what the interview was for jobs, what we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So that time, when I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , my October 22, 1997 sisters were here already. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They ca — they — they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> because they were single and it was easier to get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So my sister and my brother came already. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And they waited me — they waited for me six months before they came, they waited for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">First of all, I could have come really before. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I didn’t want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I had such a good life over there, why leave such a good life? </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Why go away? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But my friends told me, this life is good, but <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> even is a better life. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I say, what do you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So they says to me, did you see the Marshall plan, an-and all over <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He says, you see, all the star — things comes from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Could you imagine if you go to the source where you got all those things? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And there how good it could we? </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So I let myself talk in, I say you are right and we came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And when we were — they were — the arrangement from the organization, they made arrangement we should go to <span class="DLF">Lafayette Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">But my sisters — sisters and my brother told me, he says, it’s not so cozy with my aunt, the way she wrote we should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">First thing my aunt did, she looked all over our packages, she figured we have a lot of money in there, we brought over from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So it was a different aim and so soon they saw me, they say, you not going to my aunt, he says, you go to the HIAS in there, and — and be established from over there, whatever you have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You want to go from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So I find they already give me all the information there, so I went to the HIAS. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">October 22, 1997 Now they took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> , they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> to take from the — from the — from the thing — from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> there, from the <span class="DLF">terminal</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> to take you to the HIAS. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I — with my head down, I looked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So the guys asked me in Yiddish, he says to me, what are you looking for? </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Wassusto(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I said well, I was told there’s a lot of money in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I thought maybe I could pick some — maybe I could pick up some. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">The guy says to me in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish]. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Til you gonna see a dollar, you’ve — you’re gonna get black and blue til you gonna find a dollar here. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">You gotta work your head off. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I says to my friend, see why we came? </span><span class="sentence" id="672">You gonna work your head off, you had such a good life in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So he says to me, one guy which you get a — still in contact — we still have a few friends we are in contact from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They are spread all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So, I says to him, okay, let’s see the bottom line what’s gonna happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So we — I always wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Whatever I did, I wasn’t happy, I just wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So once got together with my sister and my bro — my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">He sits down there, he says to me, look, we know you had a good life in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , better than we had in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , because it’s a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , different [indecipherable] with better things in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But I want to tell you something, my brother says to me, when you came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , did you see the Statue of Liberty? </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I say, what’s the Statue of Liberty? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Did you see somebody like a woman holding October 22, 1997 one hand up and one hand down, with a book’? </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I say yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He says, you know what that means by us refugee? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The hand up means welcome to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The hand down means, you never gonna leave the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Here you gonna be buried and die in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you never gonna leave that. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So we all start laughing and that’s what it happened, exactly what happened, you just go [indecipherable] think like this, so you’ll always come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So we were in the HIAS a week or so, and then they took us to a — to the Joint in there to start interviewing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">What kind of — they had a big — big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> over there, just — I just forgot the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And there was a lot of people, they interview you in your own language, [indecipherable] what job you could know, what job you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I told them what I could do, and — but in the meantime til they find something, I — my aunt had a cousin here, and he was a tinsmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So in the meantime, I — I — of — I just —I—I was without work maybe — maybe, maybe two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So he says to me, look, a temporary thing til you get the real job, you come work for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I have work for a— once in a while I have a little work. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I do roofing, I do other thing, repairing. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So I says, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So got a few dollars that time, for — so I went to work for him, he was someplace in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and you had — go travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , if you don’t know you — you know, you don’t know your way, you don’t know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So I supposed to start eight o’clock, I used to leave 5:30 in the October 22, 1997 morning because I left a few hours for going from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other one, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> — I traveled all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> before I re — I reached the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I think it was in <span class="DLF">Grammerton(ph) Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , he had a job, til I got used, better and better. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And my uncle wanted to show off that he’s a real American when I used to go downtown from him from — fr — when I used to go with him, travel around from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">one</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So he bought a newspaper, he looks in the newspaper — I don’t even think he knew how to read that time because the newspaper wasn’t even straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So he takes the paper, looks in it, he comes to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> the next day, he throws it in the garbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He says, you see, that’s what you do in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You look in the newspaper, you have no time to, you throw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I don’t even think he knows anything in that thing because he couldn’t read at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Why he wanted to make an impression to me, that he — and then I went out after, I went out with my cousins and they took me around, they took me to <span class="BUILDING">ice cream parlor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And I go in there and get an ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">She says, you know what you with that? </span><span class="sentence" id="710">You lick it. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I said, no kidding, I said, I didn’t know you lick ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I says, you think I come from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , I didn’t have ice cream in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , or in any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So — but I didn’t want [indecipherable] so I’m glad you told me, at least you teach me something, you know, weth — important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So finally I got — I went back for the interview and for the job, and they still couldn’t find the right October 22, 1997 job for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I find some people who we came over with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> together, I ask them, where you working? </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So they told me, I’m working there and there in a <span class="BUILDING">metal factory</span> , but it’s so dirty over there, we couldn’t take the dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So he says, but I’m sure with your background, I think you could get a job over there and you could work in there, provided you like the grease and the dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So I went in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for an interview, and the guy was talking to me in English, what the heck, I know English, I know a few word, okay, okay [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So he says to me, first I want you to go try my friend, he has a <span class="NPIP">place</span> over there and see if he could get you a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So I went over to the guy over there someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I went in there, I see people working, cutting wood and other thing, just — just a regular work. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Went in there, he start talking to me, I didn’t understand not one word he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I had to work harder, I say okay, okay, I don’t understand a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I mean, to give me the courtesy, I speak so many languages, can’t you talk to me in a different type of language? </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So was sticking to the English. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So then I went back to the — to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the guy told me he is working. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I went in there and comes out — the guy comes out first, interviews me and then the boss comes out and checks out the interview, see — he looks at me, he says, you know, I see something in you. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I’m gonna give you a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And I’m gonna try you out, see what you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So I went in in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> over there, machinery, dust flying all over, because that time they didn’t October 22, 1997 care too much about the pollution, all those thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And I went in there and I would take anything, because if you have no language, I mean you don’t know the language, you have to take what you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So I went in there and start working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  When you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , did you feel welcome by the Americans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  I felt welcome almost by everybody because I have my tattoo number from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and it was summer too, and I was going without the jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And matter of fact, some of the American people, they even got up and get me the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , even the older people, they says, here, sit down, I see you standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But I was very welcome by the Jewish people in general, talking about the — the refugees, wa — all they went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And also some of the people and — and — in — in the job, they were afraid that something is wrong with me because I went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , or maybe I did some kind of a criminal activities I did, why di — they put me in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because they couldn’t understand why I was, you know, in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So it was very hard to explain, which I could not explain, but after they saw pictures, and they saw the newspapers, so they start to get a little bit educated more, a-and start to accept me. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But I should say, the worst — somebody to call me Jew, or thing like this, yes I do have encounter with the people who were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I — I understand already a little bit, and I remember one guy used to call me hey Jew- boy, come over here, hey, Jew-boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I figured that’s the way you call somebody October 22, 1997 over, til somebody else told me what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">But I couldn’t do nothing anyhow, and I didn’t want to start up anything because like I said, I was afraid for the job, an-and that guy was a little leader over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And on the end, we worked together with the guy, but I never trusted him because he never trusted me either. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So he was doing some mechanical thing and I was doing different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And I did not encounter anything, I would say, went in in a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , thing like this, cause — what — no — I wouldn’t say ant — anti-Semitic thing when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Maybe I didn’t understand, I didn’t speak the language, but [indecipherable] I think it turned out pretty good.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1401">ANSWER:  Yes, I was in the same camp from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">First of all, he’s starting up with his life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> someplace where he was before they send him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And from there where he picks up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> til the liberation, it — it’s exactly what I went through, because he was in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">And it’s — it reminds me the thing, a lot of thing, which I couldn’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Like I was working when they had that <span class="DLF">mine</span> working in there, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And I was working for somebody there, for a German guy, a civilian guy, I didn’t know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">He puts 1t down in the book, what the guy’s name was and it was very interesting to me to see it, which I have a copy and I treasure it very much.</span></p>
