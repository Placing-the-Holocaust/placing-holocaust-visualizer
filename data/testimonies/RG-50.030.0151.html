<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  ... please, and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Uh, my name is Paul Matasovski. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And uh I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Moldavia-- Romania</span> --called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> , in December 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Tell me about the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Tell me about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Uh, well, uh it's an interesting story is my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father--Leonid, his name was--he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in 1917, probably with the Russian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Nineteen...maybe early 1915, 1916; and after the Russian revolution in 1917, he decided to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Moldavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So he was a young man, and uh he was interested in uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">At that time was very new things, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So in, even in the Army, if I recall my father's stories, he was in a unit who handled car repairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So he was a kind of specialist in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So he starts some, some kind of work in car repair in my small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My mother, Maria, was born in another small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , my guess, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falticeni</span> , in <span class="REGION">northern Moldavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And with her parents come this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Bac_u</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  How would you spell that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that she came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Uh, yes, uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falticeni</span> is F-A-L-T-I-C-E-N-I, approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So we are close to say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falticeni</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And uh her father, if I recall, my grandfather, he died before the Second War, and she had a sister who uh died during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Was a lot of diseases at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And she was with her mother in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Bac_u</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So my father once walked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> approximately where my mother lived and saw nice girl outside in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and started to talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And he came a couple of times, the same way, because he has the feeling that he likes her. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So shortly after probably a couple of months, if I recall, my father told to my mother that he wants to talk to her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And why to talk to her mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Because I want to ask your hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I want to marry you. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So it's a kind of excitement, and uh, in principle they agreed to marry and start to see more often. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And probably after one years, they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So uh, my family life started I guess in the 20's after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I don't know if I was clear enough, but this is our start, the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  What was it like for you as a child growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  It was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Uh, now after so many years, when I recall how it was to be a child, it's, maybe it's different and my last years I went, and I grow and I leave and I work in very big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , but at that time, even I know that it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">For me, for all the children, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> was a very, very big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And if I can recall, maybe I was when I recall first time, I may be five years old or four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We start to play on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We always, my friends, we tried to play on our <span class="DLF">backyards</span> and <span class="DLF">front yards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And again the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , we, we played, we used to spend lots of time on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> running and playing https://collections.ushmm.org and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">As I recall our <span class="DLF">street</span> was a dirty <span class="DLF">street</span> and we liked at that time when it was raining, to go under the rain, and after the big rain on the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a lot of uh creeks, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water creeks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And we liked to, to run uh barefoot and to make all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">paper boats</span> to throw away. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And was a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">What can I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">At that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And to know for sure no matter what happened, we have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very early in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">To be ready for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Was a tradition, probably in our family, other families, for families to be together for lunch, for dinner, for whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Whenever we eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I remember my mother told me once, you can go where ever want, approximately, but be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at five o'clock or six o'clock, what time was for the dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So was, I have very nice feelings and we didn't have any very big problems at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We didn't know about problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We tried to plan you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Like every kids every <span class="NPIP">where</span> , you know, have the same, probably saw the kind of beeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We were no different from other people, other young people, other kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">What, were, did you have any sense of uh, what was it like to be a Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> even was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , had a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , even some section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , like uh I cannot say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but uh some two, three, four <span class="DLF">streets</span> , famous because the Jews live over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And most of the middle class and maybe poor Jewish people live in the same section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And other <span class="DLF">streets</span> in other <span class="NPIP">part</span> were lot of Jewish families over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So uh first time I uh, I start to, to think about to be Jews, when we go for the holy days to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My parents, especially my grandmother, uh, start to take, to take us, me and later on my brother, for the holy days in the fall and the spring to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So we start to, to, to know about the Jewish life and to know about uh other Jewish children over there, and what I remember, which was a lot of fun for us, for uh Passover, Passover, there are two things which I recall today. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We use some special uh dishes, special plates for Passover, and we kept in <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , so and packing all kinds of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I notice my mother, before the Passover, told us to go in <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and to bring the dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And so was very big event to go, you know, to climb, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Another thing which I recall, besides other things, to get uh matzos, what you call this, matzos? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Was, you couldn't buy in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> like we go today in all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and buy, you know, we want for uh Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It was only one manufacturer where the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We have a big <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> , as I recall, and you have to go and they start to manufacture during the, before the Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So was a big <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You don't have to uh to make a reservation. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Everybody comes and stay on the <span class="DLF">line</span> and take the <span class="BUILDING">matzos home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So it was a big, big event to go and to go as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , people to take the matzos to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And other interesting uh story that I remember, may be like a tradition, I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Before the Passover, always, my parents bought new clothes for us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So they bought all the time you know, clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But for Passover, it was, we were kids with this and new clothes, and go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and everybody wanted to show. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Look to me how good clothes I'm wearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Kids, but everybody wanted to show what kind of new clothes as we have over there, so it was kind of fun, you know, for Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And uh, later on, I start to go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and uh, to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The system of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> is different than here and now. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But first time, we uh found 1n our https://collections.ushmm.org classes some Jewish and non-Jewish kids, and we knew some families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So uh many, we start to make friends, it's true non-Jewish and Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But the time went by, and the more after the year start to appear some sign of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The more the Jewish kids, Jewish students come together, because they sometimes was the object of some bad words, maybe bad action. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">After a, after a while some uh Jewish students sometimes start to congregate, to gatherings during breaks and uh after work and before work, so uh was a big connection between uh I can say Jewish students of all ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Were there, what changes, did any changes take place in 1933 when Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">What began in the '30s to happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , if anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  I guess happened many things, like in the all world and uh I was very young, uh young boy at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But already I remember very well in my family, my father and I guess in that period was '33, '34, was the first trme a radio in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we (were) not wery rich, I guess, like middle class, we didn't have a radio, so he bought a second-hand radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And we start to listen to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And we started at that time to hear more and more about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , about Hitler, about what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So the people start to, to talk and I heard in our family, talking with some friends, talking about what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And people already become to be anxious about what the future will bring because we had some feelings, not to I say we, we kids, but Jewish people said something's starting to, to, to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It's a quietness and it's a quiet life which was before over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And if I remember again was a lot of articles in the press at the time about the events. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And uh, was some kind of discussion now and people start to talk more, but was only talk at this time about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , about Hitler, about the situation in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  And when the war actually broke out, what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Now we come to the period of time when I guess I remember most about what happened and to my recollection I have more lively now, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And matter of fact, even before, before the war started, the war started in '41, if Iremember June, I say 21, '41, the war started, the German started to cross the Soviet Union's <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But before '41 already the situation was very tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Number one, in '39, '38, when Hitler start to act aggressively and to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in '38 and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> if I remember, we were more anxious and many people, many Jewish people, start to think to emigrate from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And our lot of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is the young organization over there, and uh, always uh Zionist uh movement try to convince people to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> even before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">By the events that happening before the war, 1n '38, '39, the international events start to show to the people, specially to the Jewish people, to find a way to escape in case Hitler would come close to our <span class="DLF">borders</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But between or besides the international conditions, uh domestic conditions change. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Some fascist organizations like Iron Guard and other organizations start to become more, more aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And they start to take action against the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They start on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to, to beat some Jewish people in '39 with some, some, some uh big uh, uh grow of this organization encouraged by Germans, by other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So in '30, '39 the situation start to be very tense for all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I have to, to tell you no probably and https://collections.ushmm.org I'm sure that when the German went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and occupied in September, I don't know, September Ist if I recall, beginning of September, we heard by the radio, but after two, three days already the Polish troop start to run from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and to come toward <span class="COUNTRY">Moldavia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And one day, one morning, I remember like now, it was four in the morning, we heard a large noise, big noise on the, my <span class="DLF">street</span> , and like a big column of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> or heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> start to moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Unusual noise for a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So everybody went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was four, five in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And we saw some columns of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , loaded with uh Polish soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Dirty, uh thirsty, very very uh tired, like escaped from, from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the first thing they always asked for water, some food and was a very very depressed situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It would depress anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And to know for yourself as the first time what the war means. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We saw on our <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and was in '39, and uh the Polish troops start to, to get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> , ask for more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They start to trade something, want it to be free, and there's long story what happens uh Polish troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But began the first sign when we saw the war in our uh, in the middle of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So we understand that the situation aggravate and aggravate more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So even before the war started in '40 other international events and domestic events starting to, to, to uh, to occur over there and the Iron Guard and other fascist organizations become more powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And the political situation start to uh, to be very tense and as we know, in '40 and beginning on '41 was a big change. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The king was take over from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">throne</span> , was uh expelled out, and uh General Antonescu the power and installed a very fasciest dictatorship together with Iron Guard, which was very extremist, but after the war start a fight for many reasons, not now the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to tell between Iron Guard and General Antonescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And General Antonescu become very powerful and in charge of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And he start uh, '40, end of the '40, beginning of '41, to take some uh very drastic measures against the Jewish people over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So before the war start, I can say that we felt strong already the impact of fascist dictatorship government in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I can elaborate more if you want what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">That's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">That's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Uh, what, talk a little bit about uh, what kind of groups were you in at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Were you members of youth groups, were you involved in anything as the war approached, '39, '40?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">This is other interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Like I told you when uh in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and in other probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , there was a lot of uh Zionist organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Young organizations, not young, and other political organizations, non-Jewish, with democratic tendency for more kinds of uh political uh beliefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And they understand, uh many people understand that the time comes to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It's not only to wait to see what happen will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So there started a lot of discussion between uh young people, maybe old people too, to find a way to organize something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And uh, specially I can say, in uh '40, the government, the fascist government, uh issue a lot of laws against the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And one of them between many was a uh forbidding children, students, Jewish students was expelled from the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And here comes a very, very interesting situation position of the Jewish community, because when all the students, Jewish students, were expelled from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , immediately was the Jewish local, Jewish leaders and the rabbis have big meetings what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So they decided again maybe my recollection time-wise not exactly month or year, but and '40, https://collections.ushmm.org beginning or end or the fall of '40 or beginning of '41, the Jewish community sent or decided to organize own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for Jewish students. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They promised to find the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , to find the teachers, and was a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I recall something about they decide to give the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and other <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> available was the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> and start to organize the first <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in the, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And there a lot of professional people who never in their lives they were teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They offer their service to be teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They got engineers, we have architects, and maybe other professional people, lawyer I remember, who become teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we start to have our, our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So we start an hour of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to discuss a lot about what has to be done and besides uh learning and teaching and the teachers, the students start to talk about to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So we start to organize some group, as a mixture of Zionist young people, non-Zionist people, and to have some friends who are non-Jewish in other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we start to talk to them as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was very difficult to start to make connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And was other political parties, democrat parties start to, to, to uh enter, to think about organize some. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">At that point we decide to organize some group over there to do something because we have some signal from abroad what start to happen to the Jewish people in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So we start to organize some group and to find a way to fight the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Because now in the '41 the war started, the Jewish people more restricted in movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They were confined to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , specially to the Jewish young people, specially, and uh sent in uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and mandatory <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> for the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Uh, they close the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , <span class="BUILDING">public hospital</span> , to the Jewish uh patients, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So was started to, to, talk and to think to do something, and we start to organize some groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">At one point between Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  What kind of groups were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">What did they do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Now this is very, very interesting uh question because basic is the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The most important thing I guess, thinking now, we didn't, we didn't have any information about what was going on in the war because all the press was already the first of all, was uh interdict radio sets was taken from the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">All the Jewish people has to give_ beginning '40, '41, the radio sets. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So was not a way to, to listen to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The press was under the control, and they publish only what was interest, in the German interest was this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And before the war and after the war starting to publish only war, German what you call communiques about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So one of the first things we sought was to find what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So some, our friends have some connections, have some friends who are non- Jewish and start to, to have uh networks to find information what is going on through the people who had radios, have information based on their position, parents' position. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I remember even was two, three Jewish people who interested in the electronic like today and two of them decided to build from, from scratch, from nothing some small radio uh equipment in order to listen what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So this one was the first action, and we start from time to time to have some uh, some news. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They succeeded to uh get some information through some if I recall BBC from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and from probably from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> they catch some, some news over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But the interesting part with that uh the young people who, who put together this radio, during the day they dismantled the radio because if some police came in https://collections.ushmm.org <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they don't find the radio even and hiding the pieces and during the evening they put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Was a very difficult operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Basically, this is a fact, that was not uh parts put this way, and together parts was a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So the first action was to get information and the, the second part was to uh disseminate this information. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So we start to write the news in some small piece of paper and to give to other young people to, to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So was a shade of transmission of the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I recall at one point, we start to find many ways to hide this small paper on which we, we wrote some, some news. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So we start to take for example, some soaps and cut in half the soaps and make some, some <span class="DLF">holes</span> , and put together and keep the uh hard papers, small papers, and using the paper and to give the soaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Or other way to hide them and to transmit them as material some all kind of <span class="DLF">doors</span> at one point I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Some, some toys we used. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So this is the first part of the action, was related to knowing what was going on and where we stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Later on we decided to, to start to do more, more action, more uh specially action against if we could the German, and if not the German uh troops, against the German uh place where they manufacture war products. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a couple of <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">If I recall one was <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> manufacturing textile to prepare to uh, for uh military uniforms say. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Was a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> prepare leather, paper and other kinds of industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And all this industry at one point works like forced labour, a lot of Jewish young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And sure non-Jewish people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But many, many workmen were sent to fight against the Russians, the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So a lot of young Jewish and young, non- Jewish people, young people fifteen years old was brought to this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> is start to have some connection and to start to do all kind of sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Say, if I recall, to slow down the production for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">To start to uh, to break some machines over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And was very, very, uh, at that time very audacious actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Was not maybe very big, we don't blow <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , but we start a movement to organize the young people to fight against the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and this movement start to extend to non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Some non-Jewish young people refused to go in the Army to fight the war along the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So uh all kind of action. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">At one point was a discussion to start to do something about the German, and many nights, uh many Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people succeeded to go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> close. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">For example where the Germans keep their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and to open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tank</span> and to put say some sand <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And we discuss at one point to start to bring some small pieces of wood planks with nails and to put 1t some <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you know that the Germans uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> will go through in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But was interesting because uh, many people at that time was divided I can say, how to act. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Some, now, maybe appear very easy you know when you talk as far as the part but at that time to go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a big deal to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Uh to meet some people over there was very difficult because of curfew after six o'clock no Jewish on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And the Jewish has to wear some special sign, the star of the Juda as they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But uh at one point, maybe, this is interesting as I...(PHRASES MISSING)...but uh at one point uh many people thought its maybe better nothing to do because no matter what you are doing we exposed to something. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And was a good feeling that later, uh sooner or later, the German would be defeated and all American Army will come to liberate our part or maybe Russian will be come first over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So anyways they will come, so why to uh sacrifice our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But was a strong feeling among many people that have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You know how many people died towards the front, how many people died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , so many people feel to do to fight against the Germans and oh, the https://collections.ushmm.org people, the young people, I talking about young people, maybe not only young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They don't care at that point about their life because they want to sacrifice to do something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So you were part of this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">You were doing these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Uh, what about your family during this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">How were you living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  That's a good question because uh this question applied to, let's put it this way, to the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">What happens to the Jewish population? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I have to make a short or long paranthesis about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The Jewish situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> during the war was different than in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in eastern uh <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> even because of political situation, because the General Antonescu could become an ally to Hitler and he gave everything including a big army to fight along the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They kept, the fascist government in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , they kept some uh power in uh day by day administration of the <span class="REGION">territory</span> , of the <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And they was in charge to solve the Jewish problem over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So they decided for many many reasons, don't to send the Jewish people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">To use them, to put them to work as a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Was more useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They can because they took a lot of young people and not young people to put in the army to fight against the uh, along the Germans against the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So a lot of <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , they don't have manpower, labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So they want to use the Jewish people like a labor this <span class="BUILDING">work factory</span> as they put a lot of people over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Other Jewish people, let's say young people not only, was sent to build <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , to build uh defense uh <span class="DLF">lines</span> , at the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So just speaking, most of the Jewish people were not sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Was used to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Some were sent in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> 1n the <span class="REGION">territory</span> which the German took from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , and maybe come back, maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They start to arrest a lot of Jewish leaders and non-Jewish leaders and to put on uh, in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But was a small way to make some small, small amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Because when they keep the people, the Jewish people, working in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , they give something. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They pay like a very minimum, very minimum salary. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I don't want to express how much was, but say enough to buy some piece of bread, was a bread twist or to buy some uh cornmeal or to buy other product which was if there was a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And other interesting thing I guess, now talking with you it's in my mind, a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the <span class="REGION">land</span> , and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some <span class="REGION">land</span> or <span class="DLF">farm</span> , two, three, four, five miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , they come everyday in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Special <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Or they have their customers like to bring the milk, to bring the eggs, to bring whatever, the chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I remember, say in our family, was a special farmer which come every day, before the war, every day they bring the milk in front of our <span class="DLF">door</span> , some meat sometimes, fruits, vegetables, so was some relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">When the war started this farmer, or some farmers, continued to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to sell their products and many times they help the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They say start to give some products. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They don't have too much because some members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war, but uh they continue to, to work the <span class="REGION">land</span> and they come with the less product to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But was some way to, to get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And the Jewish people started to sell what ever they had to the people around. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">This only because big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They start to sell maybe their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , they some goods whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Maybe they have some gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Maybe they have, whatever the Jewish people start to sell, to sell, to sell for nothing to, to buy the main product to uh, to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So was https://collections.ushmm.org some, some kind of connection to get some food over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But the problem what important first to keep alive and good health because, if I recall, the <span class="BUILDING">public hospital</span> closed to the Jewish patients say so the Jewish community start to organize some <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> and to use some Jewish doctors to give uh consultation over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They start to, to get a way to get some medicine, but was more and more, become more uh uh seldom to get medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We can't get medicine, we can't get medical assistance to get an operation we need. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So many people start even to die, to, to loose their health because of the conditions uh, medical conditions over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And because they cannot feed the family, suppose the young people didn't have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So the most important thing was to keep alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Everybody everyday was the fight to keep, to keep alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So was not, not very easy but was not enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Was most important to, to have to drink, like water or you know, some, some food to, to, to eat over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And maybe other thing I remember maybe could be a part of this survival, I don't know how right or wrong I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">The fascist government start to take the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> from the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And this is, a Jewish family has a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is ten <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Most of the time they took all the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or nine <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and they let the Jewish owner to stay in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Five, six people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And they give the rest of the non-Jewish people who occupy the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Sometimes, being a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , they have some <span class="DLF">garden</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So they start the Jewish people to, to uh to <span class="DLF">garden</span> a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">To put some potatoes, to have I remember for some time, sometimes maybe some tomatoes to put over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Some stuff to use, every possible to survive, to get some food over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But the health is a problem and everybody was afraid every day somebody was, family would be taken to sent far away in special detachment, uh special uh formation to dig uh fortification and many people didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Was taken to say different part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to work in the uh forced labor in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And many didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So uh the most important was to, to keep, to be alive and to be like your family to go through, through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And something else which probably could happened that I try to explain now is maybe some people are involved in and uh history research will go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But we know in '42 starting, Germans start to, to be defeated on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and was a discussion about to open the second front by United States uh Army with uh Allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So uh when uh the situation become worse and worse on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> , <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , Zionists start to come back, and many wounded soldiers come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They brought very bad feeling to their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So non-Jewish family start to understand, and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So they suffered, the non-Jewish people suffered a lot, even if they are non-Jewish, they give their uh children to go to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They lost their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Was tough for them even to, to get food over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So many non-Jewish people start to, to, to help the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Some neighbor would give sometimes say uh a bottle of milk to help, a loaf of bread, start to be some connection again because the people understood that on one hand the Jewish suffered, but they suffered too. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It's not like to help the Jewish people, and maybe was, maybe, maybe was some opportunistic situation because they say this good, good relationship with the Jewish after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Who knows, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So uh the situation was tough, and many non- Jewish people took out many special fascist organization, took advantage, took all the Jewish business, all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish factory</span> , all the big <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , or small <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> , so the only hope of the Jewish people was to, to get out of the war and we know that there be https://collections.ushmm.org or due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our <span class="REGION">territory</span> or to the Russian army, start the offensive about the Germans over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So every day, every minute start to follow the news, where 1s the front 1s moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And I recall like now when was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> , our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , was a big map of the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> showing how deep the German troops and others to penetrate in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">How they move from say uh eastern, uh western part of the <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> to <span class="REGION">Caucasus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And everyday in '41, the <span class="DLF">line</span> of the front moving further and further. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And we look at the map sometimes and we were very afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The further the German went, uh further our our hope was diminished, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But after a while we knew the situation was changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The Germans start to uh to be defeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But the arrow was a sign on this map remains the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They didn't move to show how far they come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So we start to, to find every way to get information, were we stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Each day the front came closer, closer to our uh <span class="REGION">land</span> , to this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So uh, the more we knew about the news, the uh Russian Army come closer to our <span class="DLF">border</span> , the more we think that maybe we will escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But we hope at the same time and everybody was, a lot of discussion, about the opening of the second front in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And was a lot of discussion about American troops would come through the <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at one point, to the, to open the second front. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , by the <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to cut the German and probably the Russian to go toward west. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But as you know, doesn't happen and the Russian came first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  What happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">This is 1942, the tide is turning, the Germans are being pushed back. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">What are you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Uh, well, at one point say in the '40's, '41, I was in the uh <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I start to be involved with a lot, with this organization who start to fight against the fascist regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And in the '40, end of '42, '43 probably, I was sent to work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325"><span class="BUILDING">Textile factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So I was a worker over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And being over there I was involved together with other young people over there in kind of organization to sabotage the production and we try together to connect other people in other <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to start to act against the German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But at one point, say I was over there and basically the night I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Some people were sent to work outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They have to stay to sleep in special <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But some people work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , had the permission to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was a better situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So basically I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I left the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the morning, I came - but in eight, in uh '43, in the '43, in the fall of '43, part of our organization was discovered by police, by security forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And we start to be followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So we stop for a while our activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  What were you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">You, you refer to our activities, you said sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">What were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Basically, we start at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> like I told you before to spread the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">One of the big activities, to spread the news, to try to find out, to write what is going on at the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And to put in all kinds, to work on a way to transmit this news, small papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We started in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to sabotage say the equipment, the heavy equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We started to dismantle some, some uh part of the equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Uh we start to cut some textiles over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Uh we start to put to prepare <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> some planks, some wood with nails and we start to from https://collections.ushmm.org time to time to go close to some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German vehicle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German vehicle</span> who went to the front, to put the sand or even to sabotage the tires, was over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So this kind of uh activity was basically, and uh in '40, uh, was end of '43, the police discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They have an agent which introduced in our organization, and to the agent that we work with him, probably was wired to some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">He knew a lot so the spring of '44 they arrest uh five, six people in our organization and I was sent to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And I was interrogated. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I was tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I was there beaten to, to give information about other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Finally, we, was in the spring of '44...
QUESTION:  Back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">What happened to you in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I want, describe what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So basically I was arrested in the spring of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And I was in our local police interrogated. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And after a while in the same time after two or three weeks, they decided to evacuate the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> because the front start to move in '40, in the spring of '44 very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And <span class="COUNTRY">Moldavia</span> was the first part to come under the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So they start to evacuate. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">The government tell uh <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So decided to send us another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to finish interrogation and to prepare the paper to be uh, to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So we was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gala_1</span> , on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And over there starts some interrogations and start to prepare based on declarations made by uh the agent, the informant agent against us in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Because we fight against the Nazi, you can't fight against a dictatorship, Romanian dictatorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But meantime, the war start to be closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And they, try to remember, with some a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">war planes</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> start to fly over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and maybe some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American flights</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So every day, every night was some Allied movement, what you call it, air (air raid), air raids was over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So one day they decide it's not safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So they decided to send us, this group of young, was not only young people because we met other people over there, to move from this <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to other <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> more safe and prepare to go to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe ti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe ti</span> , was a very famous because of <span class="DLF">oil fields</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And one night they took irons, they put chains on our legs, and chain our uh arms, and sent to other <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But in fact was not kind of regular <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , was a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> as was transformed in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we stay over there waiting for the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Was in uh uh '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And in the spring of '44, toward May '44, start the Russian, recall the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> was uh broken, the Russian victories against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They come very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They, they took uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They took <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They come close to the <span class="DLF">Romanian border</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> , on one hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">On the other hand, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American aircraft</span> start to bomb the Ploe_ <span class="DLF">ti air fields</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And from our <span class="NPIP">place</span> we saw many times the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> coming bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe_ti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We were very happy any time we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe_ti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We knew that the war had come to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We don't know how close we are to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So uh one day, in the spring, wait first of all, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gala_1</span> even, we was kept in every, everybody in different <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Was cement on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , nothing, was a piece of wood or something we slept over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Was a, how you call it, is a piece of uh, an <span class="DLF">opening</span> which you can't make our need, put it this way, and once or twice a day they come to give some bread or some water, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And was very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Most of the people become sick over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Was, was the spring of '44 if I recall and we cannot talk to anybody over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Any connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The first time we talked to our people, our uh colleagues which we were together, was the transport https://collections.ushmm.org from uh Gala i to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe ti</span> , was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We stand, we cannot sit because of our chains. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We sit together, or stand together, will start to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Anyway, we become very sick when we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe ti</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe_ ti</span> in comparison with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gala _1</span> was a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> because being a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> we have the right like everybody there, to walk out in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">There was some <span class="NPIP">place</span> under surveillance but one hour per day or one hour every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So was a big change for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And, and this uh <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we could talk a little more free with other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Was not only political prisoners, how you call it, maybe they were criminals, maybe whatever they were, but they had some information about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And one day we find out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe_ti</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We saw them very heavily that uh, uh front was again broken <span class="COUNTRY">Moldavia</span> as the Germans started to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Uh through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian mountains</span> towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Translyvania</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And then unexpected for us, one day, I saw the, we saw that the people over there who uh ran the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> start themselves to pack and to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And they told us they would take us to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So one day we were put together in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , from <span class="BUILDING">station</span> went to, by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They could free us basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Because the front is broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Everybody takes care about themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We had some good luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">In other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , before the Russian came, I heard they killed the prisoners over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">On uh other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , they keep the prisoner to the last moment and the Russian troops liberated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So basically, basically, uh as the international situation, there is a war help us to be liberated from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Thanks. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">We're going to break. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We change tapes now. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">End of Tape #1 https://collections.ushmm.org TAPE #2
QUESTION:  Let's go back, Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">You've taken us to liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We want to go back now. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And I want to get a clearer picture of you in the middle of this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Uh, tell me about the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Uh, first of all, even before that, by 1944, starting between '42 and '44, things were becoming very difficult. (</span><span class="sentence" id="428">Yes) Were you, at what point did uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> begin? </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Were there any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  At beginning of the war, if I recall, that's '41, and before the war even, when they start to issue a lot, many law against the Jews, one of the law, besides many, was that the Jewish we cannot move from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They are confined where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">More important, in order to uh have the possibility, to monitor the Jewish movement and to, to, uh to get a better from their point of view, the fascist government, a better possibly to, to uh to keep control of the Jewish population, they order that all the Jewish people from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> around our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , for example, to go and to go, to come in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , like our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So a lot of Jewish people, and there were thousands and thousands, left their small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , which were 20, 40, 100 miles, and they were evacuated in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They left everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They come alone, with some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> or they walk sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And they have some relatives where they stayed, like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">We had some relatives came in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we, we gave a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and was uh two adult and two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Another Jewish family gives their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> as a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So uh at beginning of the war, the Jewish people were around and concentrate in some big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> or small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , but, in order to be easy to be controlled. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And was interdicted to move from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">The Jewish people could not move.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  When were the Jews, were Jews every deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bac_u</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  At beginning of the war, some Jewish were deported and some special <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the <span class="REGION">Romanian territory</span> and later on, in uh the <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The fascist government build some camps in the <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> and other part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dniester</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Dniester</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But when they start to deport, they started uh some Jewish people was more uh known for their opinion against a, before the war, against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So they start to deport in non-Jewish uh people who belong to some uh political party like was say some social democratic party. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Communist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They brought all Communists which they know and start to deport and put in uh, in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Some was put, they took like, this is interesting now, they took as the beginning of the war, some hostages in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> including I remember my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They took by random or some reason the police to be sure that at beginning of operations uh Jewish don't do something wrong to the whole territory authorities over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They put in special uh special <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They took a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , if I remember, and put some, they call hostages, to take Jewish hostages and non- Jewish hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And they start to uh tease (ph) them. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">See I remember because my father was for two or three months, and we were not sure what at the beginning was their intention because after two, three months, they liberated some, liberated some people from the <span class="BUILDING">hostage places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And they took other hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And some hostages were even not liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">https://collections.ushmm.org They were sent in un some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> again in the <span class="REGION">Romanian territory</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> if I recall, and uh later on in uh <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And they organized some, some special <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They sent people over there, from these hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But after a while I, probably after six, seven months, I don't remember exactly, the system of hostages was stopped over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So was not way to go from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Some Jewish people were taken and sent to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">local factory</span> , and some were sent outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I want to know what you were doing at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Like I told at the beginning of the war, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The Jewish community organized a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , very or best thing could for young Jewish people over there to continue their education. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And after a while in '40, '43 probably, beginning of '43, I was taken to work in the uh the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Like uh a mandatory labor work, they call. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So I went over there and I start to work like a laborer, like a textile laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">At the beginning they give a kind of training, how to use the textile equipment over there, very simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  How were you recruited into this underground group of yours?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  This is interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We have some uh, some friends even in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And one day one my friends, and there was a general system which worked probably, he start to talk to me more and more and talked about what represent the German occupation, what represent the German war, against become the Russian, how's our situation and start to uh convince me, I guess, we have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And as the beginning, I can't say my friend didn't tell me about any organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">He want to convince me that he has to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">The first stage of you know, uh, his work with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I have to convince me to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And he talk, and he start to give me some books to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Was other things at one point, organization, some, some German book, if I recall, , American book, Upton Sinclar, it'sa book _. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Uh we have some books by Russian, also Maxim Gorki they start to give us, uh some French also if I recall, Jaures, if I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So give some books, start to discuss, and after a couple of months, like very casual discussion right, uh he told, hey, if you agree that let's do something, let's do something, already there's organization you know, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We are doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We can get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">A lot of people think I got it, we have to do something or the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So uh in this way he introduce me to one other member of organization, but I want to tell you something here, because now I talking with you start to recall something. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Because of dictatorship, because of the terror, was not an organization like today we say hey, hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Let's make organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Let's have a meeting, call a meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Was some rules, and one of the rules of the organization and on work on the fight against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is that one member has to know only other member they contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So uh, if you were my contact, say to whom I talk, I know only you. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I got working directions, instructions from you only. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And on uh my side, after a while, if I can bring other young men into organization, to convince other, he will be into step by step, and I will be his contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So he will know only me. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So this organization, we don't know exactly to a point exactly how many people there were or what exactly is doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But at one point, he introduced me to the other, say one or two uh colleagues, who happened to be https://collections.ushmm.org colleagues, and to get together and to see what we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">More specially against the Germans and happened two of these uh colleagues in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , later on worked on the same in the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So when we went in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> , we start to discuss during break what, how to sabotage the work over there because they produce for the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And how to maybe to talk to other friends in other <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So first of all we start to slow down the work, and we start to talk to other people around. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">There are a lot of young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We was out to tell them about organization, about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">By talking about the tough situation of the people, the fact that the war have some big impact on our lives, to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And to convince them to slow down, don't work, don't get . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So I remember two or three people in a couple of weeks start to become sick, start to, to, to go around a lot, start to walk, claims their equipment doesn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So all kinds of uh action in order to, to, uh reduce the production. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And many of us start to at one point to cut some electrical wiring over there, which to make <span class="BUILDING">mortars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Some <span class="NPIP">parts</span> we start to, to, to break some part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">equipment</span> , so after a while there has to be a lot of uh maintenance, repairs, and there is not enough repair parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So one of our objectives <span class="NPIP">inside</span> was to, to slow the production ...to our possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The second was like uh political action I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You talk to the people to convince them that the uh fascist government is not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">That we have to do something, that we have to fight for liberation from German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Was like uh political activity, to have more and more people to think like what we were thinking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  What composed this group? </span><span class="sentence" id="520">You said it was not just Jews only, and not just Communists only. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Who was in the group? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">What kinds of people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  That's interesting, a matter of fact, like I told you, during the war exactly, we don't know exactly the components of this group because say I know one or two people, maybe four people, and other know other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But basically what we find out that most of the groups was a conglomerate of people from different political uh what you call, uh beliefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Was many people, Zionist young people, think to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Was Communist we sort have to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Was social democrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Was other democratic members of all this party before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So was like a united front to fight against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And the Communist uh representative, a big deal probably, after the war we find out and organize this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They have an active part. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But the most important at this point was to fight the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">In different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And uh many people thought that it 1s not necessary to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">These others because there was a big danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">You expose your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And was the feeling specially in end of '42 when we know, people know that the war will be lost by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there's anyway, the Russian or American will come and liberate and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But the problem, as you know, when the German troop retreat, they kill not only Jewish people, other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So if I don't be killed from nothing, the last day it could happen something over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So many people think doesn't worth to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">When to fight, because the liberation come anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The most important to keep, to keep us alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But other, many people thought is to do something, to give our contribution to the fight against the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  You were conducting all of this work slow down and destroying equipment and doing all of https://collections.ushmm.org these other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Uh did you do any other kinds of sabotage-type of activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  Oh, I remember other kind was I was involved was to hide them. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">They give me something to hide in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Some books, some materials, sometimes even I didn't know what's <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But they told me they trust me to find a better way to hide than some materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I remember we work not only to hide to say to dig in the uh soil something, but to use some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ' <span class="DLF">walls</span> or to, to take out some bricks and put back, and we have in our <span class="DLF">yard</span> a very old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , uh and I don't know, the engine, took some apart and they put <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And interesting thing was that we tried to uh have for this organization some people who have some connection with the government, some connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So that we can use for information. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And for example, I knew a former colleague, non-Jews, who was, his father was in the Army, and at one point we start to talk with him about, to meet him and to talk about the war, about the, what's going on, and he had some good feelings about our fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He went, was ready to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So we use him, at one time to get him to hide in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> some materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And he start to get some information from his father which was an Army officer of some type. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He knew more what's going on at the front, what's going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and many times he came to me because when I start my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> he was my uh, my colleague on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , sitting next to me, so we were some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So we start to meet after the war a couple of times, and start to use his information, his situation to give information regarding the situation at the front, regarding the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And other thing interesting say at that time that I have to tell you was a girl in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from a very high-class family, put it this way, was Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But during the war, like I told you, most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was taken by the authorities and given to non-Jewish people or they put some Army commander or officer, give some <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So uh the family of this girl which was famous in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they have their own <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was taken but had the position, had in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> an officer of the Army, a high, high-level officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So we start to talk to this uh girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">She was very nice girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And she had a bad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">She died many years ago in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">But she start to go from time to time inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">officer's room</span> through some <span class="DLF">doors</span> they have over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He has two, three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And she start in one hand to use the radio to listen what's going on and she start to, to look through, through his papers and find what's going on in uh local political and army situation and basically, she didn't have very, very deep political conviction but she feels that she wants to help somehow the fight against the Germans to, to give her contribution here. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So was a way to, to find more and more information what you want and to help and she, we gave to her to keep books and to give some other written material which were uh some leaflets for example I remember was at one point against the Germans, against the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">We distributed sometimes to some people this, and we hide it through her even in the <span class="INT_SPACE">officer's room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So this was a very, very interesting uh story you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And uh, during the the end of the war, through her we find a lot of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  You hid your material in the <span class="INT_SPACE">officer's room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  How did you do that and where did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  Through this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I told you, they have a big, before the war, they have a big <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So the authorities took almost all the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> they give to this officer, high-rank officer, colonel say he was over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And they would cut off communication first off between the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on one hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">On other hand happened, and happened many situation like this, you know many people don't recognize, some officer who were or had the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> , they know there was a front. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They don't like to die on the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So they started some sympathy for Jewish people and they start to talk to the people who, from where they took the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">They not treated like enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So with some of them,they have some, some kind of relation. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They say good night. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They (say) good morning probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They have together the coffee from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So for her, she, was easy to some extent to go in his <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , in his <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So we give her some small books and small uh paper, some literature and she succeeded to go in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Not for long, to keep, to keep sometimes <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , sometimes even under his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , something some <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So un we're very happy that she wanted to work and we know she was not a zionist, she was not a communist even. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">She was not, she was a rich girl before you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">She help the movement against the German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  In your manuscript, you describe an incident when you were trapped in his <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Tell me what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  That's true, that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Uh what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I have the connection with the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So I talk to her and she invited to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to come to discuss, to bring some materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">She went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So one uh day she told me that she wants to take me to <span class="INT_SPACE">officer's room</span> to show me the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Maybe I can find some more interesting over there because she was very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I did good or bad, I say, let's go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So one day she told me come around five o'clock, afternoon was maybe, I don't recall, maybe Saturday or Sunday some. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Her folks are out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So we, we went over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But we discussed if something happened, we start, this was before we discuss her, if even her parents would come or somebody from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or we make believe that we are in love, we embrace one another, something, you know, friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So she took me in <span class="INT_SPACE">officer's room</span> one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We started to look in his, on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , and after a while, maybe five, maybe ten minutes, I don't remember, somebody knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and enter was an officer uh assistant or something to him with access. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So was scared like death. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So immediately start to embrace one another, start to kiss one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So the officer start to yell, what you doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">You make love here, you are doing, here in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Making noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And then he start to, to went out and to was a and other <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and her parents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">What your daughter's doing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">There's a guy over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So her daughter come or her parents came over in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and started, what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So they upset about their daughter and later about me because I am somebody which was . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And we make believe that it's true, so finally went out and she had a rough time with her parents, and I stopped to see her in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> only this time, but was very funny situation over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And she was a very, very uh courageous young uh lady, and nice lady, wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Later on, after uh German was defeated and uh, uh https://collections.ushmm.org <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> become a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> again, for a while, she went to, to study and become a very good and very famous architect and later on she immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> she had a bad luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">She died of cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But was very sad, very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But always I was impressed, I'm impressed, when I think about a lot of people and about the young people from different situation, from different political point of view, has to fight the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And they don't care about themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">They are ready to sacrifice. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So uh was not selfish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So many times maybe uh the young people, I was, this time, in our time, has to know what's going on and to think about what happened and to think that sometimes in life, maybe many times, it's not good to be selfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION:  In doing your underground work, what was the worst moment you ever had? </span><span class="sentence" id="631">The worst experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  My worst moment, put it this way, was, (PAUSE) I cannot say the worst moment, was maybe was many moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">One was when being in police when was in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the same time was other two, three people which were taken, and I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> with a small <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">During the night I couldn't sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But all of a sudden I, I heard some steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And I saw two policemen bringing somebody, some <span class="INT_SPACE">corridors</span> , and after a while I realized that the prisoner was one of my colleagues over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And they brought him as kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> not far away from where I were, and start to beat him, talk to him over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I heard his screams and I heard his cries and I watched you know what happened over there and I realized, for me was the worst moment because probably was almost dead over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But here, specially I knew like a comrade and like a nice person which I talked to many times and such a situation was horrifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And was horrifying to understand what happened to his mind and his feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Was something which one is the worst moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And the second worst moment I guess was for me when we were transferred from one <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , from Gala_1, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe_ ti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I told you before. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We was put in a kind of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">By this <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> was probably, I don't recall, six, seven kilometers, probably five miles, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploe_ ti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">We were in chains, and the hands cuffed, so from <span class="BUILDING">Ploe_ti station</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> was not any communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We have to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So during the walk, during the night, was night, to start to walk and the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> was on a kind of <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We have to uh, <span class="DLF">road</span> winding and climbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">After ten minutes, fifteen minutes, almost nobody could no more walk because the chain on the legs makes them uh, wounds, wounds you because. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And they at one point start to bleed. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And they couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And almost I fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And other people fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">At that moment, we stop for maybe a couple of seconds, and once the policemen start to come to us and say, go, don't, we have to, to get to the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">You have to give you a way to catch back our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so don't care about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So it was like the end of the world for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Finally, one of uh our colleague have an idea to take some handkerchiefs or our shirt, I don't remember, to make a knot to our uh chains and to tie it to our belts so the chain doesn't fall down on our ankles here. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So we try to do this for a while, but again start to fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So the worst moment probably, we walked two hours say, close to two hours, but I thought was eternity. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And then a funny moment happened when we went to this uh <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">They have a big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Was not inside the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">The kind of <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they kept probably some uh equipment to take uh care about the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And they push <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">https://collections.ushmm.org Inside was other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">One near other one I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And in the middle of this big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was big barrel (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="669">People make their needs from this barrel. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And dirty around. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And we were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Don't excited right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I cannot believe this maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Was that people, we couldn't breathe, couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">But only very small <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> to lay down was this barrel. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So everybody jump to lay down and to put their head on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the barrel. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I cannot tell you what feeling, when you feel happy, if you can say that, because we, we don't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Was end of the . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">On other end, where you were over there, maybe wasn't like you were coming over there because they us. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Was how you call, bad, bad bad situation, but was I can see you meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He give you instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">They say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">They say start to beat me in front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And finally, we, he indicate (ph) for me that I know him, they try to bring this third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Say they brought the third one to witness against me, which I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And I, I was surprised because the third was not an agent, was other colleague, was , was my connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">He made the declaration before that he knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So he brought him to recognize me in front of the policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He come in front of me, was two people, police, in empty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">You recall him. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We look one another eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And say no, I don't know who this 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I was, to you made a declaration against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">You beated me to the death. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They start to beat him again, in front of, know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">No, I don't know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">This was most, most emotional part of which I remember like now, you know, whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  Did they beat you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They use all kinds of system to, to put you down, to , to beat on uh on legs and other parts of the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And other was times they manage you to kill or to, to uh arrest your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">This was other system to put pressure on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And you know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Was very, very afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But I can't say, maybe good luck or bad luck that we were caught at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So when the situation of war was clear for many people, local people, authorities, they start to evacuate and they know that the German cannot win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They couldn't win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">There was already change and retreat toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathians</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Translyvania</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Did you parents move away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  My parents were in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they stayed in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  They were not arrested with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">They suffered a lot you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And uh they tried the best they can to help me, but there's nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">To keep hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  How did you meet this Traian that you describe in your manuscript? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Who was he and how did you meet him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  Uh, I mentioned manuscript about this Traian or Trane. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I don't know how to pronounce https://collections.ushmm.org because was a very interesting person, very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Was a mixture of good and bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">But was uh like an interesting story, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So being this guy, young man in 40's, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">He was young guy in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I remember like now that his father was an invalid from the first war and saved some license invalids from the war, first war, to sell cigarettes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="729"><span class="BUILDING">Tobacco shops</span> to have, to give a way to make a living for the, who are veterans. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So I know about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I know him on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , maybe on the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So one day in '40 when the Iron Guard become very powerful, '40, I guess '40, maybe beginning of '41, I saw this guy Triane, his Iron Guard uniform on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Green uniform, military uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And he starts to yell and to beat some people who think they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And for a while, at the end of the '40, maybe beginning of '41, the Iron Guard was part of the government of the dictatorship of General Antonescu, was most extremist right say wing, fascist wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And some <span class="NPIP">places</span> they put their people in charge of the security forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The police we call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So this young man become the chief of security, of police in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Iron Guard security. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">After a while, when uh Iron Guard was defeated by General Antonescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It's a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Many run out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and many disappear, there's a fight on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">It's a long story, don't want it in details, but I didn't hear anything about same person called Traian. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">When I was arrested, and moved from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gala_1</span> to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , was by, moved by a uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with other people was this guy Traian. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">After say three years maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I was surprised what he's doing with the people who fought against the German, because a part of Iron Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I didn't know, I couldn't ask him. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Was dark, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">After Gala_1, we was transferred to this <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> where was more free, so we Start to talk between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Talk to him, to talk to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And I asked one other uh colleague who was with me in organization, what's doing this guy here because he was an Iron Guard, and we fought against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And let's tell you his story shortly. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And looks first of all, he was condemned to death by uh fascist organization being an Iron Guard leader, and probably he killed somebody or something happened, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So he have a bad sentence, and in order to avoid, he ran out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and later on come back and he was hiding with a neighbor who happened to be Jewish guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He's former roommate or colleague or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So this Traian who was Iron Guard security chief and has a death penalty on his head was hiding, by in a Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">After a while, one of the sons of the Jewish family was involved to some extent in this organization, anti-fascist movement and they told to one of connections that they know they hiding this guy over there to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So one day they decided let's use him somehow because he's not Jews uh, and let him try to go to send him to some camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> with Jewish people, non-Jewish people, communists, not communists, to help them, to send some money, some, some uh packages, some products or some <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> or some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So he agreed to go again like a what you call underground to help the anti-fascist forces, put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So he went a couple of times to what those days was occupied by Germans to help, not to help, to uh transmit some money, to transmit some food, some clothes, something to the people that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">One night before uh probably we was arrested, he decided to go out from hiding, probably to go in uh special <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to have some lady relationship, with some prostitutes or some bordello or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And he went over there and some policemen around recognize him, so they put him under

finally https://collections.ushmm.org they decided to arrest some people of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , including him. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So he went together with this group and our group when all was the same time to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And he, he was again put under trial and put uh inquire and put on the investigation, not like Iron Guard, but like helping the anti-fascist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But he was all the time afraid that he was put there because he was an Iron Guard, so after a while we start to talk and I start to talk to him, and he told very vague, not in detail, that he knows his past, he regret it, make a big mistake, and he want to pay somehow and want to help the movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And probably my feeling he was a little opportunistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He knew, he was smart guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">He knew that the situation would change anyhow, so it's better to have good relationship with uh anti-fascist groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So after uh the German left and uh become independent uh <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> again if I can say, he was in charge for a while like security chief, security force in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Bac_u</span> but now like presence of communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And happened he married a Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">But finally after a while, put it this way, was a lot of uh discussion, a lot of uh problem, the relation with others, not only with him, Iron Guard people and uh fascist people who converted during the night to be democratic, to be communist and to help the communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So he was, we found this true, expelled from communist party and take out of his job and sent some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in our small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to work like in accounting. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">But uh was pretty interesting story about him and uh how some people are liberate during the war and before the war, how some people change the color of their shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Because I met in my life many, many kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Some people have some convictions, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And the keep their conviction, right or wrong, to the end of their
