<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Will you tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Agnes Grossman Aranyl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , May 2nd, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Will you tell us something about your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I actually had a large extended family, but the nuclear family only con...consisted of my mother, my father and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  What did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  My father...I uh...he was in the <span class="BUILDING">textile business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">He was a merchant of sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He really didn't have a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He worked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I really never understood what he actually did, but he was selling uh cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was...I guess in between a wholesaler and a <span class="BUILDING">retailer</span> ...a middle man, and he worked out of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He was a salesman basically I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my mother, of course, those days she was a housewife when I was first born, but of course when my father uh was drafted in the forced labor camp, she had to take over my father's business and then after the war subsequently she had a <span class="BUILDING">jewelry store</span> and uh after the communists took over she went to work for the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What was your childhood, your early, very early childhood like before the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  I have a very very few recollections of my early childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Actually I uh just remember flashbacks of my father who was...uh started to go away in 1939 and kept being drafted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> and uh he begin...he began to disappear for three to six months and then it became longer and longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">When they would draft him, it would take eight, nine months before he would return and then one time he was away for ten months, and finally in 1942, that was the last time he was drafted and he never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And uh remembering my mother who was a very bright woman and was able to take over and be the head of the family...I don't mean just the nuclear family but head of the extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">In fact she was instrumental saving my grandmother and myself and a lot of my cousins during uh the war and the Nazi occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I remember that the whole family used to gather at my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we used to have Friday night and Saturday night dinners at my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh maybe because my grandmother was living with us, that so...we were the gathering place for the whole family, and that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">That's what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I have pretty good memories of trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We used to have a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , Lake . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We used to go there in the summers and it was just a very...what I remember was a very uncomplicated, very nice life before my father left in 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  What do you remember about uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , playmates, friends during that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Actually I don't remember an awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I remember that about 1940 we used to have quite an elegant <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I remember that the Nazi party decided to have their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> there, and uh we were evicted from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we had a hard time finding another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> being Jews and finally we found a less elegant but an OK <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> uh in a in another part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I remember asking my mother to take the <span class="DLF">walls</span> with us because I really was very happy in that particular <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but we were evicted and we moved into a much smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and uh we were there until uh the Nazis occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Tell us, if you would, you started talked about 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So let's go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Let's...tell me, as the war broke out indeed, uh in addition to the move, what happened to you, to your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Well, in uh...as I remember and the dates may escape me...as I remember 1944 when all our troubles...
QUESTION:  Let's let's back up a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Let's stick with, if we could...I don't want to jump to 1944 just yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Let's let's talk a little about 1940, '41, and '42...the the early years. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">What, what was your life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">What did you as a child do to ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  I think the early years were comfortable years for me in spite of my father not being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I uh remember uh good times with my extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I remember vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I remember having a German governess whom I couldn't stand, whom I had to go out uh walks with and the lady only spoke German to me and I had to answer her in German and I did not like her and I did not like the idea not being with my mother who had to work, but having some other people taking care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But I don't remember anything horrendous from these early years. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I have to add that my mother had two brothers, and they were also taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> and they never returned, but the early years when uh my father kept coming back and we had the extended family around, they were fairly happy times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  What did you for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Let's talk a little about.....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  In uh...I was four years old in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> - '40, '41, and then I started first grade in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in 1942 when I was six years old, and uh that was uh...I remember that being a good year. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">However the following year I remember in the second grade we only went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for two, three months, and I thought that was terrific (laughter) because then the war broke out and we stopped going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But uh actually the early years in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> for the Hungarian Jews were fairly pleasant, uh if I remember correctly as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was also thinking being an only child and my cousins being only children, the families really could not, did not feel comfortable having more children because they could see the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and my mother herself decided to have an abortion. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">She told me that later, because she just couldn't bring another Jewish child to this world, our crazy mixed-up world as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But the early years as far as I was concerned were pleasant and they were alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The difficulties started when we had to start wearing the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">That really, my self- esteem just plummeted and that was a very difficult period when a big yellow star was on a young child with uh the inscription of Jude, which meant I guess in German, Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And then that was already beginning of being marked as being different and less...oh what's the word I want to use...maybe not quite as competent as the other children were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Go on and tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Tell us more about those years as things now began to be very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Things are begi...began to unfold at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We started to wear the Jewish star and we also had to be at the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There was a curfew, but we still were able to go out and go shopping and buy food with uh the Jewish star on. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We had to wear the Jewish star all the time whenever we left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was sewn on our clothing, and we were marked as being different from the mainstream and psychologically I'm sure I really suffered from this distinction. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And then afterwards uh we were told we had to leave our second <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because we had to move to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was designated for Jews, and of course we left all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> at the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and just took a few belongings and moved over to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was designated to be a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> where Jews could live at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And uh we moved in with a sister of my father's, my paternal aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">There was my grandfather, my aunt and her two children in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and my grandmother and my mother and I in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">two room apartment</span> , and we had to...we were there for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I really can't remember how many months it was, but we were there for a few months and that's when things were starting to really get bad for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">First of all, we had very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">When uh there were a lot of air raids we had to rush down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">At times we just didn't even bother to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My mother says if we have to go__, we'll just go, and that's when things really started to go downhill. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember a couple of episodes which are quite painful while we were living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Well, my mother several times was rounded up and she had to march to different <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> where the Jewish women were collected and were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and for one reason or another she was always able to come back, but as a child the fear was just tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">If she's not going to come back, who's going to take care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I felt very very very lonely at those days and very isolated, and I remember also the whole family once was rounded up uh downstairs and then we were...something happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We were able to go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Another painful episode was when my mother was rounded up and uh she decided that she's not going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">meeting place</span> and she was all dressed in heavy winter suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">In <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> the winters were quite severe, and heavy boots and heavy winter clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">She was all dressed up and she decided just to go <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with her clothing on, and uh uh she said whatever happens, happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">She's just not going to go and what happened, a German soldier came up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> looking around, making sure that all the young women were downstairs and ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and my mother was covered up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I was with my mother and I lied to the soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I told the soldier that my mother was sick and she could not go anywhere and she couldn't move, and I told the soldier...as a child I learned survival skills very early on...I told the soldier I have a doctor's certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">If you just wait a minute I will get the doctor's certificate for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Six years old and uh...seven maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And uh what happened was that uh...there was no doctor's certificate of course...I kept looking and looking and opening drawers and started to really search for the doctor's certificate and the German soldier who could have been sixteen years as I was told, just left. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He could have shot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He could have forced my mother to go, but by the stroke of luck he just left so I was told that I saved my mother's life at that point, which was probably true. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But I also lived with that the rest of my life...that I am able to save people. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And uh after that there were more roundups of Jews and the janitor one time who was a Christian woman my mother befriended...befriended and of course she also kept happy with various pieces of jewelry, came up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to tell us that now you just have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">This 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Everybody's going to be taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and you just have to disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Well, we didn't know what to do at this point and somehow or other...this is where Wallenberg comes into the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Somehow or other we gota ___ they called. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Somehow that afternoon my mother paid somebody off or somebody was willing to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We got a to be able to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> , but of course by the time the arrived, mysteriously arrived, we couldn't go out anymore with our Jewish stars because it was after the curfew and we knew the next morning everybody's going to be taken, rounded up and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> from this particular <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , so somehow they got this Christian woman who after the war turned out to be Jewish herself, working at the underground...somehow they got this Christian woman to come and take us to the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We had the but that of course didn't mean very much, but we were able to...this woman came and uh we took, we tore our yellow stars off and uh pretended we were Christians, and I remember to this day, I never forget that, that this young woman who came to get us and my mother who was also fairly young at the time, and myself, without the Jewish star started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It seemed to me that we walked four or five hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We we probably only walked a half an hour to forty-five minutes, and I remember these two young women started, when the soldiers would come up, these two young women started flirting with the German soldiers and I also remember them speaking German, not Hungarian, during this journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Of course we didn't have any belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My mother had a pocketbook. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I had nothing, and the trio was just walked while this the young women were flirt...flirting with the soldiers and somehow we got to the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We had a hard time getting into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because the janitor did not want to get...let us in, but uh the women were able to convince the janitor in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> that we did have the documents and we belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> and we're going to be...we are entitled to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So what happened they finally let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> and uh we went into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was full of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I remember it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">two bedroom</span> , two room or <span class="INT_SPACE">two bedroom apartment</span> ...I can't remember that...but we...people on all on people...1t was just a horribly busy <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I...1f I remember correctly there were sixty people in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with and of course they weren't very happy that three additional persons arrived, but they did let us in and uh we made a little nitch in the corner somewhere and we went to sleep at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was a very...it...] remem...I can't remember whether we were sleeping on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> or just on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> but we were so tired and emotionally exhausted that it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We had a safe, quote safe unquote <span class="NPIP">place</span> to put our heads down. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Somehow my mother...we stayed there for could be a month to six weeks in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and it was pretty exciting because people were coming and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We would listen to...play wegie (ph) boards of what's coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We would listen to the the American broadcasts and uh somehow the rest of my family one by one found out that we were in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> , my mother and I, and my cousins kept coming and since my mother told them since she had the it belonged to the whole family, so she managed to have all my cousins come and stay with us in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> and I think she paid somebody off because my grandmother appeared on the scene who was at that time in her late seventies, and somehow somebody brought my grandmother over. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Since we had this uh __ she could come with us as well and uh she had the prime place in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">She would sleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathtub</span> because that was the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> 1n this whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and since uh she was the oldest person, she was able to stay with us for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I need to take a glass of water now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  We'll pause for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  We're talking about your grandmother and the....
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We were in this...I was one of the Wallenberg kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Because of Wallenberg, I was able to stay in this <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I was able to have the _—__ as we all know today didn't mean anything, but in those days in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> it meant an awful lot because it did get uh a person into a protected environment, a seemingly protected environment where people could just stay for a while and I...really and truly I know more about Wallenberg since I've been in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I had no idea who he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and uh but our happiness in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> did not last for an awful long time because uh finally the Germans decided that they're going to invade the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> , so they came in after a while and rounded us up and marched us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The march for me...
QUESTION:  What was that...excuse me...what was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Can you tell us what that scene was like when the Nazis came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Very frightening, very...didn't understand what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Could not comprehend that we were in a protected <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...how can they round us up and invade us. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was a very very frightening experience, but of course none of the Jews had any repence or probably even if they did have any they couldn't have fought off the German army, so we had to be obedient and do whatever we were told and survival depended on our obedience we felt at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So when they rounded us up to take us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they marched in and we had to leave again all our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We had ten minutes to pack our stuff and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I was uh...my mother and my grandmother, myself were getting ready to go on this march which again as a child it seemed to me was endless. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I was in charge of the photo albums, to carry them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and my mother carried of course whatever she could and my grandmother could never carry anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She had heart problems and she hardly could walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">During this march they were shouting and shooting at Jews and we would just step over corpses like it was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We just were psychologically numb and we were just walking around, walking along and did what we were supposed to do and I I dropped a photo albums and that's why I have very few photographs left before the war era and uh my mother yelled at me not to stop and bend over and pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I can, in my mind's eye I can still see those pictures all over the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and uh I just had to leave them and march on. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We were marching on for a little while, and then my grandmother said during the march...and this was really my most frightening experience in the war...my grandmother said she couldn't walk anymore, so the whole transport, the whole group had to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was about two hundred people in this march, so everybody had to stop and the German soldiers came and told us that they're going to shoot my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She's too old. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She can't can't march. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They're just going to shoot her to death, and we should all go on, and my mother said she's not going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">If they're going to shoot my grandmother, let her let them shoot us all and we're just not going to leave an old lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But I remember the guns pointing at my grandmother and subsequently the guns pointing at me and my mother and they were ready to shoot us, but then my mother saw a child in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stroller</span> and we were so so...we we hardly have had any food at this point so we were all so thin that uh she picked up my grandmother and put her in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stroller</span> and took the child out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stroller</span> , put my grandmother in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stroller</span> and we marched on. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And we got away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So what happened, when we had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> my grandmother was wheeled in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stroller</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and we all made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But I I'll never forget that scene and I'm still very frightened of any kind of violence and any kinds of guns because of this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It's just...when a young child has a gun pointed at her...just something happens and one never gets over this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But anyway, we were able to march into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and everybody was able to...everybody survived at that point and uh we did march into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Of course the circumstances were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I had lice all over me, not just in my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Body lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We couldn't bathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We couldn't eat and we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for about two weeks before the Russians came in, and what I had heard about uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> days are very hazy as far as I'm concerned because I kept fainting from the lack of food and my mother told me that I didn't have food for three, four days before the Russians came to liberate, so my recollection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> days are very hazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I remember being in downstairs in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> sitting and not having any food and I remember other Jews eating chocolate while I was just starving and I had no food at all and nobody ever offered us some food, so it wasn't...1t was survival of the fittest. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It wasn't really let's all survive, at that point and again I think because of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> ...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was undermined and we were going to be blown up at any minute, but I think because of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> we were saved and the Russians did...of course there were a lot of air raids and a lot of fighting, but we were so happy to hear the guns because we knew that liberation couldn't be too far off. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And that's how I survived those years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Tell us, tell us what happened at liberation...what was it like and what did you and your family do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  What I remember of liberation...the Russian soldiers came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and uh somehow a few hours later there was some muddied soup which they gave to all the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We got some food at last and little by little we were able to...I mean after being really singled out as Jews, able to be free and take our yellow stars off was just a very exhilarating, exciting and frightening moment at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But little by little life got back. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Of course we still didn't have food, but it was easier to obtain some foods later on and we were able to get back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and uh try to resume life, and life was very difficult after...between 1948...'45 and 1956. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I lived under the Russian oppression for about ten years and again food was very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It wasn't very fashionable to be Jews again and in fact I had to change...in order to obtain a job...<span class="BUILDING">college</span> was out of the question for me because I came from a capitalistic society and uh it was really out of the question for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I had to change my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I did attend a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> and uh I was singled out again as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I had to change my name from Grossman to , which was a Hungarian name so I wouldn't be singled out as a Jew and I remember having very little food in those years as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Food was always a problem. (</span><span class="sentence" id="167">Laughter) And the survival...we really didn't have the...what we really needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We had a very...we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Sometimes we didn't have fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We didn't have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I remember it was sin to have any napoleons (ph), uh gold coins, so we were so afraid of deportation that my mother flushed a couple gold coins down on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> because we were so afraid that if they, if we're going to be found out we're going to have to go outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and...uh I'm struggling for the wor...word...I don't know what happened with capitalists during the communist uh regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They were forced to leave their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and they got a sub-standard <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they had to survive the best they could there. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So we didn't want that to happen to us and that's why we flushed those gold coins down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I'll never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And uh again life was very difficult, being singled out as Jews, so when the revolution came about in 1956, we were very happy to be able to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  Tell us about that escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Since I uh lived with the idea that my father would have been alive if my mother did not want to stay with her family but left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1938, I subconsciously knew that when the opportunity rises, I'd best leave <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So in 1956 during the revolution, I was then twenty years old and I had a Hungarian fiance who was also a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He was hidden during uh the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I uh...it was really my decision to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Of course 1956...I experienced another war during the revolution and again we were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> came in and there were a lot of shooting, a lot of killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Again we would step over corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I mean it was psychologically numbing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Survival was the main thing during those revolutionary years. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">My husband then was a college student in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> so he partook in some of the demonstrations and uh we decided after, when the Russians came back, we were best to escape <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Of course by then we both were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We knew how to survive, so we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to as close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> as possible when we decided to leave and uh we stayed with some peasants near the <span class="DLF">border</span> until we found a guide who could led us over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The <span class="DLF">borders</span> were watched by Hungarian and Russian soldiers and uh it was very difficult to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Again we had to...oh we found this...I'm getting a little fuzzy here. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The memories are just rushing back into my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We escaped with my cousin and her husband and two small children ages three and five. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And uh what happened was that the kids were scared and crying, so before when we paid off the guards in order to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , we had to get some rum and had to give it to the kids so the kids were drunk and fell asleep and my husband carried uh one kid and uh the kid's father carried another kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We had to walk in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">The winter's are very difficult and heavy in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and we dark winter clothing on and we had to walk in this dark clothing in the snow at night to be inconspicuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">When the Russian or the Hungarian soldiers were shooting at us, we had to lie down in the snow with our dark winter clothing in order not to be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We walked across...we had to walk a good twenty miles until we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and the walk again was very very frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was like deja vue. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">What happened as we were marching uh to escape...to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because they were shooting us at us from <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> and we had to know where to walk, where the <span class="DLF">border</span> wasn't undermined. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Finally we got to a <span class="DLF">creek</span> which led us to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and this is where I just knew I'll never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I was just ready to give up and die. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I was so tired after...and scared...after walking for several hours at night in the snow that I was just ready to give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">There was a log between uh <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and people walked across the log but I wasn't coordinated enough and I wasn't...I was so tired I knew I'll never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So finally people told me to sit on that log and I was able to just crawl over to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> on that log, and I was very fortunate because we made it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">A lot of people were taken back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They could not escape, but we were again very fortunate to be able to manage to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  Indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">What did you do when you got to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> we stayed in uh...subsequently we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> and a Jewish organization was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They put us 1n a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , the Pathenon really, and we stayed in the Pathenon for two, three weeks, trying to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We were planning to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , but there was a real iron curtain in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We had no news from the west at all, and we thought <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> would be wonderful because we would be as far from Europe as we could be, so we decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But my husband had a relative who sent us a telegram from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ...don't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Life is good there. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">This is how the decision was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And uh however we were applying to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> but the American Jews, the HIAS organization didn't want us because they didn't want to be responsible for us and they turned us down. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Finally we were able to find an organization which brought over three thousand refugees regardless of religion, and this was the Tolstoy (ph), the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy had an organization bringing refugees over and uh by the Tolstoy organizations we were able to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And again of course we felt very alienated and not belonging and it usually takes an immigrant five years to really get into the mainstream, to learn the language, to learn the culture, to learn the customs, so again we had to forget and relearn new ways of relating to people and new...uh how to live ina new <span class="REGION">land</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  What was your adjustment to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  I had a very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I didn't expect all this difficulty, but I...thinking back I think I was pretty depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I felt alienated. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I didn't speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I didn't have any skills then. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I didn't have any education then. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I used to...uh the early years were very difficult. [...</span><span class="sentence" id="230">after arriving...upon arriving to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> (ph), and at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> they were sending uh people all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we were told that we should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> because they, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> wanted some refugees there and we spoke some English. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">It will be a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So we moved to No...so we said fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We'll go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We didn't know anything about anything, so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">southern town</span> , not really wonderful for an immigrant, but uh the reason we went there because they told my husband that he could finish his schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He was an architectural student. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">There were no <span class="BUILDING">school of architecture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So we had to move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raleigh</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> , where he did finally finish his schooling and I was working at <span class="BUILDING">Woolworth's</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raleigh</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> , really not speaking English very well and not being able to...I really wasn't employable. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And so the early years were very difficult for me, and uh learning a language, learning a culture...it takes a good five years for a person to really feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Is there anything you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I think when I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I'll remember a thousand other things to add, but right now I think this is my story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  What do you think the effect of the Holocaust has been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  This is a difficult question to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I've been struggling with it for fifty years. (</span><span class="sentence" id="249">Laughter) My self-esteem was non-existent. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I had to really work on developing some sense of worth. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I think that sense of worth...I think that's what's the...I felt less than equal for years because of the Holocaust, because of escaping of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I had a very very...I think the biggest problem is that you just don't feel quite as good as the other guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I think that was one of the major problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Until you really feel good about yourself and who you are and you can accept who you are, it's just very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Self-esteem is the name of the game I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And that was really just can't and it just negated who I was, what I was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I was very ashamed of who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I didn't feel good about myself...for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Tell us what you're doing now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Well, I became...in order to help myself to feel worthwhile I became a psycho-therapist and working with other people, helping them to realize who they are, what they are all about and help them to develop a healthier self-esteem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">END OF INTERVIEW </span>
