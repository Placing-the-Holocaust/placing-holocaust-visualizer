<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Fritzie, we're going to begin our interview now by asking you to tell us your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name now, or my name while I was in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Well, let's start with your name now, and then—
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My name now is Fritzie Fritshall, and my maiden name was Fritzie Weiss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And where were you born, Fritzie?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> — a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> called <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klyucharki</span> , which was near a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">They were like, I don't know, maybe 20 kilometers from the “big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ” called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What can you tell us of life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , as far back as you can remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  I came from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">There were not many Jewish families in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We were maybe a handful. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I was a child, and I don't — I, I couldn't tell you how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But it was a close-knit Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Prior to the war, I personally didn't — I did not feel any antisemitism directed towards me or my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">As far as I remember, we lived in peace with our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My friends were not Jewish as well as Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">In fact, my very best friend was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">She was a young lady, a young girl my age, who used to sleep in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We would share a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , many times, and — as I would sleep in her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I, I personally never felt any antisemitism directly towards me, or directly towards my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  What kind of work did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  My dad came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> just before the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Our families were farmers mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And I don't really recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I think he was, he was an owner of a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> — <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> , prior to coming to — his coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I don't really remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">To tell you the truth, when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I came to my — I had very few memories of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He was like — it was like coming to a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So I really don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  And when your mother was looking after you, when you were growing up as a small child, could you tell us whether she looked after you alone? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Or were there others in the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Well, we had — my grandmother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And, of course, I had uncles and my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And we did have family. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There were some cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We were very fond of our grandmother, and I spent a lot of time there; and my mother also had her parents, who lived in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And so she had support from both families, both on her husband's side and on her, her own parents' side. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But after my dad came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he used to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">When my dad came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , it was right after, I believe, the Depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and earned three dollars a week working for <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Sausage Company</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And the story went that my dad would send us a dollar and a half to live on in Europe — which was a lot of money at that time in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And, of course, he lived on a dollar and a half here. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And when my dad came here, immigration was very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">In those days, a man had to show that he could support a family before he was allowed to bring a family to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I believe there's a long story behind this, but by the time my dad was able to send us papers to immigrate to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the war had broken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my mother was afraid to take her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I had two younger brothers; and my mother was afraid to take three children on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that might have been bombed on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span> , that were beginning to be bombed already because the war had broken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I, I believe this is the joke of, of the century: her being afraid to take us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that might be bombed, and then getting caught in the war in Europe and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So....
QUESTION:  As you speak of the war beginning, could you tell us what your first impressions were of the beginning of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  The first — okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The first that I really knew that Jews were being persecuted in Europe was as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I recall my mother taking us — meaning my brothers, my two brothers and herself — going to my grandfather's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my grandparents lived, where my mother was born and came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And she took us there, often times, for visits. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And, I believe, in 1939 when the Germans took away citizenship from the Polish Jews that emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , became German citizens, established businesses in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and fought for the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">These Jews were asked to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when Hitler came into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He took away their businesses, as you well know; and he took — confiscated everything they had, and sent them back over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">When these Jews came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They had no <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ; and of course the Polish community did not want these Jews back. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So a lot of the Jews were being persecuted, and a lot of them went into the <span class="REGION">mountain areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My grandparents lived close to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ; and, of course, in — near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I recall, as a child, these Jews coming down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> looking for <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> ; and begging for food, begging for warm clothing and so forth, to take back to their families in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I recall, as a child, helping my grandfather; taking buckets, pretending we were going to feed the animals, and going into the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And carrying food and warm clothing in these buckets to take back to these people, so that they could take it back to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I recall hearing horror stories of Jews being persecuted in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Of course, we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But we knew — I knew, as a child, that Jews were being persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I recall hiding many of these young Jewish people that would come; and putting them into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and covering them with straw and whatever, and taking them into different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So that we could help these young Jews escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We still had freedom at that time, and little did we know that we were going to be next. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That we were going to be persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So I did know at that time that Jews were being persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But we still lived in peace with our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We, as I said, were not being persecuted at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Our life was peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The businessmen did or went about their business as they pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And that was my first recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Then I recall going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czecho</span> — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klyucharki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I had a young uncle that must have been 17, 18 years old at the time; and as <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was being occupied, this uncle pretended he was going to take eggs and things off of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> to go into the big city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He would take these things and put them in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and pedal to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ; strictly to find out about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , what was happening around the world, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Because that was the only news we could really get. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We didn't have television and we didn't have radio, as they do today. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And my uncle used to come back and bring us bits and pieces of news. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We were not allowed to listen to this news, we as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We were being protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And we were just — we were getting bits and pieces of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So I did know that in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> Jews, because they were Jews, they were being persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But we ourselves were not touched by it at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Actually, I personally was not affected by this until Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and took over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  My first recollection was when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The night before going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my friend who was not Jewish — she and I slept in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Slept in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , played as children do. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I remember my mother opening the <span class="DLF">door</span> and telling us to go to sleep, because we were being noisy and the next day was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">She and I got up in the morning to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , one morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">When we came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she was allowed to walk in and the <span class="DLF">door</span> was closed to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I was told I was not allowed to walk into <span class="BUILDING">class</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I needed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">A teacher who was my teacher, who took out a white handkerchief from his pocket the week before to wipe a smudge off of my face, turned to me one day and told me I must not come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">All of a sudden, for whatever reason, I needed to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and not come back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I remember going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and crying, and not understanding why I was not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">A few minutes later, my two brothers came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They too were sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and were told not to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Because we became quote "Jewish" overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My mother had to sit down with us and tell us the facts of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Tell us why we were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore; tell us that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was invaded by a man called Hitler who was a bad man. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We did not know about the killings at that time — at least, I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But we were told that there were certain rules we needed to follow from now on, and one was not to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I recall the laws being set down one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Not being able to go to a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , except during certain hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Not being able to work our <span class="DLF">farms</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Not being able to walk into a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> anymore, except during certain hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Not to go into a <span class="DLF">park</span> and sit on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , unless it said, "For Jews Only." </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The wearing of the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And the hours we were allowed to be out, and the hours we were — has to be back in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And those were the first that I personally felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And then, of course, the laws that came down one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Everyday there was a new law, and everyday we had to obey the new law. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And we were not allowed to walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">If someone came towards us that was not a Jew, the Jew needed to step off the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> to allow the next person — who of course was not Jewish — to walk by. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I recall our neighbors turning their backs on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Spitting on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Neighbors who lived in peace with us, who were our friends the week before. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then, of course, we were lucky we were farmers; because we would have starved to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">You know, it's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You, you sit and, and you talk, and as you sat and memories came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It took me many, many years to find out why my mother would put food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for her three children at night, give us our dinner, and after she served us, she would walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">She never stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I could never understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Just recently — shows you how smart I am — I've just recently figured this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I probably had forgotten all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The reason she didn't stay with us was because there wasn't enough food to go around. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So those are my early memories of Hitler walking into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And, of course, then there was the knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We were told to gather our belongings, take warm clothes, take our valuables, and to take our pots and pans. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We were told we were going to be relocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And as we know today, they lied. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And we believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I'm not sure if our parents knew what was going to happen or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But we believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I think we needed to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And, of course, as we know how brave Hitler was — the knock came in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was the last days of Passover when they came to get us, and they told us to take whatever food we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We didn't have bread in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We still had matzo. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I remember my mother packing matzo to take with us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It seems like yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  You mentioned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or did they transport you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We needed to get undressed every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And we needed to run — not walk — in * roll call (German) > Dr. Josef Mengele front of Dr. Mengele, or his entourage, which was SS soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We needed to show that we still had strength left to — whether it was to work or to live another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I recall some women were beginning — as the hair grows back, they were beginning to get gray hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And they would go and take a little piece of coal from one of the pot-bellied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> that was in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And they would use this coal to color their hair with, so that they would look a little younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I mean, one grayed at the age of maybe 18 or 19 under those conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And they would run — we would run in front of whoever it was that was doing the selections, to show that we could survive one other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">If one had a scar, a pimple, if one didn't run fast enough, if one didn't look right for whatever reason to the particular person that was doing the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They would stand there with a stick — to the right or to the left — as you ran by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">One never knew if they were in the good <span class="DLF">line</span> or the bad <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">One <span class="DLF">line</span> would go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The other <span class="DLF">line</span> would go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , to live another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">This is how the selection was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I believe there were so many people that needed to be gassed every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And we knew the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were coming in; and we watched the people marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And we knew many of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were being emptied out, day in and day out, to make room for the new people that were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We never knew when our turn would come next. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So one always lived in fear, and one always tried to get through these selections for one more day. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And, of course, the Appell. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They would wake us up at the crack of dawn and empty out the entire <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And we would need to line up in fives to be counted, twice a day — the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">To make sure no one had escaped, no one was missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Sometimes we would stand there for hours and hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Just stand to be counted, until every single person in the particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was accounted for. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">You must remember, there were thousands and thousands of people in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Whether it rained or the sun was out, if it was hot or if it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We had very little clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And, of course, 1n the summer we had to wear whatever we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So if the sun would beat down on you, many people would faint during these "Appell" counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Nobody ever wanted to be at the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and nobody ever wanted to be at the front of the <span class="DLF">line</span> ; because for whatever punishment was being dished out, they would pull people from the beginning or the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> to punish these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">To show us what would happen to us if we did not obey orders in every day living. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And, of course, the dead people that that would die during the night from starvation or disease, or from killing, from beatings, they too would need to be carried out from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> every single morning, and lined up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They, too needed, to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Every single body needed to be accounted for. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Day in, and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We would not get any food until every single person was accounted for. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And then we were allowed to march and get our breakfast, which often times just consisted of a cup of coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Often times they would give us a little soup and a small slice of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And most of the time, of course, we didn't have any water. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So we would use that hot coffee to wash our faces and our hands with. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So we wouldn't even get the hot coffee in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">This was our existence while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">My job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was — they would line us up every morning and they would take us <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ; and we would carry huge rocks from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">One day we would come, and we would take these huge rocks from this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and we would carry them to that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The next day, they would bring us back; and we would take these same huge rocks, and we would carry them from that <span class="NPIP">side</span> back to this <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Now you need to know, we were undernourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We were all weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And to carry a big rock like that was a lot of weight and a lot of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">By the time they take us back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> at night, we could barely crawl. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But we needed to show that we could still walk, and we were strong enough to give one more day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  How long did that go on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  That went on for several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It went on for close to nine months. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Until one day they came and they were emptying out our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And we knew exactly where we were going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They lined us up, and they were marching us towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It was our turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">My aunt and I, and the rest of the women, marched towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And they had a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My aunt was chosen to go onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to be taken somewheres else. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I was chosen to stay, to march into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">The last my aunt saw of me, was walking towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> as she crawled down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and begged could I come onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And they were laughing and said no, but she could come down and join me, as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were pulling away. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">As we started to walk towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and we were walking in, I was at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> — again, because of my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Six of us were pulled out of <span class="DLF">line</span> ; and I was literally in the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I will never know the reason why. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Six of us were pulled out and put onto another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , with several other women, to go to work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">When they brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , I was the youngest of 600 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Our job was — we were doing parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Each one of us had a different job to do, and this was — they were doing parts for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">My particular job was to put the spring into the compass that would go onto an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Because I was the youngest, 599 women shared their precious food with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Allowed me a little extra food every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">If anyone could rest, I was the one that would rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I was their hope to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I was their hope to carry the message to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">To tell the world what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It took me 40 some years to remember a promise I made to 599 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But I remember today. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And I remember every time I stand up to speak, it was due to them that I made the last days of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Of the 600 women including yourself, do you recall how many were able to come out with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I don't know what happened to any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">As <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started to lose the war, they started to gather us, of course, and the famous death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And we, too — all of us were — joined a group, the group from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And started the death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I don't know if you're familiar with the death march, but it was — I don't know how to describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">All of us were weak already, but we knew — we did not know where we were going to go, but we knew that it was the last days of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We knew because of the bombings; and we knew because of the way the German soldiers were pushing us and pulling us already, and emptying the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They took us all and put us together, all of the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And they had us march through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and through <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">They didn't know where to put us anymore, and they didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And there was no food, because the Germans were losing the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Often times, as they marched us through a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a <span class="DLF">window</span> would open and a shutter would open, and either a potato or a loaf of bread would come flying out; and the shutter would close after. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And we would all pounce on this potato or this — whatever this piece of food was that came at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And, of course, they would shoot at us; but we didn't care at that point, because we were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were literally covered with bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">As we marched, we would pass bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Body after body after body. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">People that were dropping dead from hunger, from disease, from dysentery; because they did not have the strength, or because they gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So we knew it was towards the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We would sleep in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We lived on whatever we could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">If we could find a carrot, a potato, snails, snails! </span><span class="sentence" id="483">In order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would come down low, and shoot at us often times. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Towards the very last, a friend — a girl whose name I do not recall — and I ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I believe they saw us run. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I believe the Germans saw us run; because they could have shot us at that that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">We ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and spent the first night in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And we spent all the next day there, because we were afraid to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And when it started to get dark, she and I found a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to walk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And we came to a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And, of course, they had to know who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Our heads were shaved and we wore striped clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And we begged for food; and they did give us food, and told us to go into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Because they had to go and give us — get us stamps, because they didn't have enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And we went into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ; and when the man left, we ran out of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and ran away, because we were afraid they would turn us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And we lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> until the Russians liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">You know, as we read books today and we watch films, and of course, we know the Germans “did not know what was going on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So they tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They all knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">They marched us through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> to the forced labor, with our heads shaved and wearing striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Often times, a <span class="DLF">window</span> would open and they would throw food at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The workers that worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They tell us, “Hitler did this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Did Hitler really do this by himself? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Are we forgetting the machinery Hitler had working for him? </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Are we forgetting the soldiers that gathered us? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The people that took care of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">The people that drove the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The men and women who were the guards in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz concentration camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Our neighbors that turned us in? </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Are we forgetting all of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Hitler didn't do it by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Hitler had lots of help. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">What about these men that were the guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , that would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night to play with their children and listen to their music and hug their wives while they were killing our parents and our sisters and brothers? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Did they keep a secret? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Can they keep a secret? </span><span class="sentence" id="520">How many people can keep a secret? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We were told they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">What about all the people that lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , that saw the flames day in and day out? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">That smelled the stink of the bodies burning, day in and day out? </span><span class="sentence" id="524">What about all the people that saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> passing by, and the people begging for water, for food to give to their babies? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Why are we forgetting all of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Why are we saying, “Hitler did this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Yes, Hitler was instrumental in doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">What about all of those people? </span><span class="sentence" id="529">What about all of those people that were my age, at that time;
