ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And the name that you were b -- given at birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  The same. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The Polish version of my name is Andrej, which 1s spelled A-n-d-r- e-j, and as -- as in most <span class="REGION">Slavic countries</span> there’s also, for children and friends a dimunitive, and the dimunitive for Andrew or Andrej in Polish is Andrush.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  And what is your date of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born November 30", 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Warsaw</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , not in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  A-Actually at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Yes, and I visited th -- my place of birth as it were, and that is a story in itself, how as -- as we know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was systematically destroyed by the Germans, but my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> survived, and I’ll explain a little bit later, if you care, why. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">February 14, 2005
QUESTION:  What was the address of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Six <span class="DLF">Lvovaska Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That’s spelled L-v-0-v-a-s-k-a, and it is in the heart of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Let’s now talk a little bit about your family, the previous generations, how far back that you know about and where they lived and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  My family on both my mother’s and father’s side are Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My father’s family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We have the names of those who were my grandfather and great- grandfather and great-great-gran-grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Going back I think to the latter part of the 18" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I think my mother’s family was also Polish, although sh -- as a -- as a girl she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> during World War I. My father’s father, Jacob was a banker, and he was totally assimilated in the Polish culture, he -- although the family was Jewish, they regarded themselves first as Poles and second as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Remember that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> of 1939, one third of the population was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It was very much of the -- a Jewish -- a center of Jewish culture and life. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And my grandfather was a very successful banker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">One of the wealthiest men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  And did he spell his name G-1-a-s-s also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Yes, Glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I think 1-in Polish probably the pronunciation is di -- slightly different, slightly harder, but the spelling is the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">February 14, 2005
QUESTION:  An-And your mother’s family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  My mother’s family, my ra -- ma -- sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My maternal grandfather died at 55, although my grandmother, interestingly sur -- not only survived the war, but managed to escape with us, and lived to 96, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Her -- she had one brother, who is still alive and he and his wife also survived, separately from us, but are st-still alive, although they’ve lost their son who was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Domingo</span> , and there’s a story there, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Well, now let’s talk about your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">What kind of work did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Well, my father was educated as a lawyer, he had a degree from <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw law school</span> , and actually was in the same class as the former late Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , Begin, although I’m not sure they knew each other, but around the time that my father graduated, which was coincidental with around the time I was born, that is the mid-30’s, Polish a-anti-Semitism became much more pronounced in degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And as a result of that, he could not practice law in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So I think he just managed real estate properties for my grandfather, including the one that we lived in, that I mentioned earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  And wa -- did your mother work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My mother, who is still alive, she was born in 1912, and so will be 93 this year, unhappily suffered from postpartum psychosis when I was born, so I February 14, 2005 didn’t see my mother -- although I didn’t hear about this until much later, until around the time that I was two, two and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Although she re-recovered quite well, and in a very stressful time as we know war is for anyone, managed without any mental problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">She’s had psychotic episodes since, but she’s come back from all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  How did your parents meet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  I-In this climate of what might be called upper middle class, or even upper class Jews, there was -- e-everyone went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together, starting at a -- at a young age, in their -- their -- my parents are almost exactly the same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And these -- Polish Jewish assimilated culture, as it was explained to me, people did not pair off until they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So they did things in groups, went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> to find -- excuse me -- edible mushrooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Took vacations together, and -- as teenagers in -- at the Baltic in a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> known as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sopot</span> , S-o-p-o-t. And then, in their early 20’s they paired off and my parents paired off and married. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I think my father was -- my parents were 22 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My father, by the way, was the youngest of six or seven, I for -- forget, two of whom survived the war, besides my father, but did not escape, they were -- they were in -- in the ge-German labor camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And at that time, un-under Polish Jewish tradition, you weren't February 14, 2005 supposed to marry until your sisters married. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So this was an elopement because it was a-against the tradition of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But somehow 1-it all worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  How would you describe your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Di -- wha -- were they re-religious? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It sounds like maybe they weren’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Li-li -- my father was not an observant Jew, nor is my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">However, they insisted that I have a Jewish education and I was -- at that time we didn’t have Bar Mitzvahs, we had something called confirmation. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So I went through about a seven year program at <span class="BUILDING">Temple Emmanuel</span> on <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> and <span class="DLF">65" Street</span> , which started actually shortly after I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and ended when I was 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  So were they politically active in any way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  I wouldn’t say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My --
QUESTION:  I-I’m talking about the very early years in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Oh, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There was no opportunity, other -- y-you know -- you -- you mean in terms of -- of the -- the Bund or something like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They -- they were not, at all, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">A-A-As the war approached, as -- strike that -- as it became clear, or clearer that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was in jeopardy from an -- German attack, the Poles made some February 14, 2005 decisions which changed my parents fortunes greatly and to the worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Pole -- the Polish government passed a decree in -- I believe in the summer or spring of 1939, which was aimed at Jews, and to a lesser extent at Germans who controlled almost all of Polish industry at the time, that hard currencies, non-zlotys, held abroad by Poles, had to be repatriated and converted to Polish money, the zloty. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">That law was, as you might imagine, not totally adhered to. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">In fact, there is now quite a number of cases involving funds that were put in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> in secret accounts by precisely -- by contemporaries of my grandfather who were faced with this situation and whose heirs are now either receiving or just seeking to prove that -- that these funds were theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But any event, my grandfather had considerable sums abroad 1n -- particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , 1-in the order of millions of dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And in part because he was a Polish patriot and in part because he was fearful of not breaking the law, all of this money was repatriated to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and there were no funds in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , there were no funds in any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So, when my parents eventually arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with a one week visa to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they were -- they were destitute, pa -- financially destitute. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Interestingly, my father -- a-as you recall, in 1939 there was a World’s Fair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and the ability of Poles, particularly of -- of people of means to get U.S. visas to visit the World’s Fair was -- wa -- things kind of opened up, you February 14, 2005 could -- you could get a -- a visa to go to the World’s Fair, and you could take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and come here tha -- in the summer of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My father proposed to my grandfather that he -- when this law was passed, that he sign hi -- these assets over to my father and that my father come ostensibly to visit the World’s Fair, but he had the impression, which was probably correct, that if he was sitting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with four or five million dollars, that you could probably find a -- a ways and means not to get kicked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But my grandfather vetoed the plan and I often wondered how my life would have changed if -- for the better or for the worse, had he said, all right, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and if they had arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in that fashion rather than in the rather different circumstances that brought us to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Did your parents ever talk to you later about anti-Se-Semitism that they experienced when you were still too young, obviously to know about it, before September ’39? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Did they tell you of any incidents that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, he was unable to -- to practice hi -- the profession to which he was trained, but --
QUESTION:  Any specific personal -- do you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Very, very personal instances? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">February 14, 2005
ANSWER:  I don’t think so because they were living in -- in -- pretty much in isolation. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Now, I put isolation in quotes because if you have a -- a million fellow Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , you can find your way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My father’s resentment against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which he held until his death in 1993, was really centered around Polish anti-S- Semitism that was displayed after the war began, and during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And he wrote many letters, some to the New York Times, some of -- of which were published, to the Jewish publications and so on and was e-extremely active in Jewish charities during his life and gave a -- a -- particularly the United Jewish Appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And so his - his resentment was that [indecipherable] resentment is that the Poles aided and abetted the systematic slaughter of Polish Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  What is your very first memory? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You said you were born in November 735, so what di -- can you recall the very first memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember as a very small child being in pa -- with -- not with my mother but with a -- a nursemaids in -- ah, there was a beautiful <span class="DLF">park</span> near where we lived called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">park Lazienki</span> which 1s still there, and I remember the peacocks 1n the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But one of my earliest memories is of the Stuka dive bombers bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and the noise, and seeing the bombs fall on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and seeing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> , because they were -- dr-dropped their bombs from very low altitude and they would dive and then pull up and it was an extremely -- but the noise of the February 14, 2005 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and noise of the bombs made an impression for someone who was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  So we’re talking about September °39?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Exactly, we’re talking about the first two weeks of September, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I have only very hazy memories of my -- our flight from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> east. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Mos-Most of that is not recaptured memory so much as what I’ve been told by my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  No, it’s obvious that we know that many of the things you’re telling us when you -- before you were born obviously, and when you were very young is what you learned fro-from your -- your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Did -- did they tell you that they tried, besides the New York World’s Fair, tried to get out in any other wa -- any other way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  No, my father was very much a man of the world, I mean he -- he tr -- had the Encyclopedia Britannica at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so he spoke some English, which was a -- a great benefit. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He spoke Russian and German. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He traveled some with my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was conceived on a cruise to the fjords of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So he was a -- h- he -- the radio at that time -- and I remember my father telling me about listening to the speeches of Adolf Hitler on th-the radio, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="98"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was not that far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and everyone had a shortwave set so you could listen to -- to the German radio, and my father being fairly fluent in German could understand February 14, 2005 Hitler’s speeches and how mesmerizing Hitler was, although he disagreed with, obviously with everything that he had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So they were ris -- I would say my father particularly but my mother as well, were resourceful people who, at a very critical stage in the war, in the first weeks of the war, took some dramatic steps to save their lives and my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And we can talk about that if you like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Oh, that’s funny, because when my mother was ill I spent a lot of time in my grandparent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that was the -- a poly --
QUESTION:  Glot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Polyglot. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="105"><span class="BUILDING">Polyglot household</span> with Polish, of course, but also English, French, German spoken, and I remember as one of my first memories actually, or -- [-I -- I don’t know if it’s a memory or if it was reported back to me as that I asked my grandfather Jadush, which means grandfather in Polish, wh-when will I get my own language? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The idea being that I had to converse with the nanny in French and with the maid in Polish and others in Russian and German and so I had -- I’ve never had a particularly strong facility for languages, but as a child I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  So now you’re saying that your first recollection is when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was being bombed, and did you -- again, you were so very young, but were your parents comforting, did they explain anything to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">February 14, 2005
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you know, when the war began in the first week of September, my father, who had somewhat impaired vision and was also Jewish, for both those reasons was not drafted into the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But -- and the war began, either -- I’m not clear whether it was on a volunteer basis or on a draft basis, was inducted into a kind of home army or home civil defense corps, who- whose primary task was to fill sandbags around <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> and to clear the rubble from the German bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And t-to put up defenses as it were against -- ba- sandbags against th-the prospect of -- of other public monuments and <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> being bombed in subsequent days. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">In any event this was almost a full-time job, he just was rarely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as that was reported to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">In about the 12" day of the war, he was working alongside a stranger who happened -- a Gentile, who happened to be a taxi driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they began talking about what a good idea it might be for both families to get the heck out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , since the bombing was continuing and intensifying, and since the evidence from the BBC and from German radio, if not Polish radio was that the G-Germans were coming closer and you could hear the artillery fire from three <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So the problem was that the taxi driver didn’t have any gas for his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And this part was always -- I never could get my father to quite explain whether he had a stash of gasoline or he had a stash of gold, or he knew how on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> to get it, it was always fuzzy. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But the bottom line is, my February 14, 2005 father procured gas for this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> plus gas meant that both families fled in the dawn hours of September 13". </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I think a day or so, or maybe hours before -- you can check it -- the -- the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> were severed. </span><span class="sentence" id="120"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> itself held out against German attack until the end of the month. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And some people also escaped by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and so on and found ways out. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But basically we left and traveled east, around the time that that opportunity shut down. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Others traveled south toward <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and survived, but we traveled due east until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tax1</span> ran out of gas, and then we separated from the taxi driver and his family and we somehow got a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and kept going east.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit more about your leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">You again were very, very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Do you remember that, and if so do you remember your emotions and the understanding of -- I mean, you were just a toddler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I was just a toddler, I was just four, I only cou -- one can has -- have memories from that time, particularly if there’s an abrupt change in your life, and I have very sh- shady memories of that time as -- but later on, that is a year later, we ended up across the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and I do remember living in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> quite clearly, and everything since then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Do you -- did your mother ever tell you what she brought with her -- when a family has to leave a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like that so suddenly, what your folks took with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">February 14, 2005
ANSWER:  Yes, she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They took nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And th-the -- in that there’s a story, because my father’s pants, with -- the ones that he was wearing when they fled were part of a -- atemporary exhibit at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> some years ago on a group of about 2200 Polish Jews who fled, who were able to reach <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , and many of whom, not all, but many of whom survived because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And so the point of putting his pants in the exhibit was that that was the only thing he had and that was the only pants he ha -- he wore f-from the time that he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , I think, til the time he arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They were rather good pants, but they -- they saw a lot of adventure through the -- here and there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  D-Do you have any memory of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> ride with the other family?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  I’m talking about 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">That was -- that was the hi -- that was a -- a major <span class="BUILDING">military headquarters</span> for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So the Germans were systematically February 14, 2005 blowing up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , that part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that had not already been blown up in earlier fighting, or in con-continuing fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But the German officers needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, or sleep anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so our -- our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was directly around the -- around the corner from the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> was designated as a billet for Nazi generals, and therefore, while it had a lot of bullet holes in it, some of which were still evident when I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in 1977 with President Carter, that was one of the few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in central <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  -- under which the -- the Soviets invaded from the east and there was a <span class="DLF">line</span> or demarcation, so we soon found ourselves among Soviet troops who were headed February 14, 2005 west while we were headed east. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And this was also a risk because we were evidently bourgeois, educated, and there were -- I would say my father told me, and I have no firsthand knowledge of this, but quite a few arbitrary arrests of people who they just didn’t like, or who the local Polish peasantry turned in, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And that was a risk, so you really didn’t want to s-stay in Soviet occupied Poland, and we managed to find our way -- illegally, of course -- across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> where, once we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , the Lithuanian government accepted us as Polish refugees.</span></p>

ANSWER:  That was the destination and that was where we stayed when we were in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Now, what’s important about that time is that at the time we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , although there was a strain between the Polish and Lithuanian governments having to do with the arrangements after World War I, we were ra- February 14, 2005 rather well received, and my father was able to actually earn some kind of living by buying and selling stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And --
QUESTION:  What kind of stuff?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Diamond rings, and gold and people wanting to -- currency manipulation, dollars and British pounds and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He was operating on the fringes of the galaxy, but during that time there was a progressive tightening of the noose by the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">At first it was to insist on a change of government that was more friendly to the Soviet point of view, then that government invited, quote unquote, Soviets to open bases in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and eventually that led to a de facto Soviet occupation much like the S-Syrians in <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> and then finally to annexation of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> as a SSR as the Soviet Socialist Republic, which it continued to be until 1991. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So we lived through all of that, and during the time we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , the -- the Soviet presence and the s -- importance of the Soviets materially increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Now, my father, if I may continue, didn’t stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> because he was -- and again, he was very vague on this, whether he was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , or whether it, as is mostly presented to me, that he wanted to get his father out, who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So he made his way through the Soviet and <span class="DLF">German lines</span> , back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> on two occasions, and returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in the | -- winter of 1939 - 1940 and tried to convince my grandfather to leave with him, and with my grandmother as well, and February 14, 2005 they refused, and gave reasons why they wouldn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The reason 1s that basically they survived World War I, and while there were privations and problems, and several armies swept through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the Prussians, the Austrians, the Russians and so on, basically civilians survived and were not considered combatants. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">World War II, of course, had a much different aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And so the idea of going into the <span class="REGION">Polish countryside</span> , which was believed to be anti-Semitic and dangerous, th-the idea of leaving his <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> slash <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> was unappealing to my grandfather, who was then in his late 50’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  So now you are in -- you said in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Is that where you settled in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Yes, but there’s a st -- there’s a story involving my father’s second trip back in the winter of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">At -- by that time, the <span class="DLF">Polish Lithuanian border</span> was patrolled both by Soviet and Lithuanian troops, but not jointly. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And on his way back from the second, futile mission to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , he was walking along the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> in the snow with the pair of pants that ended up in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and he was a-a- arrested, I guess, or -- by a Lithuanian patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">My father said that had he encountered a Soviet patrol there would have been no question that he would have been shot, because he had no proper papers or -- you know, he was a Pole at -- with- at least suspicious, and probably a spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Any event, the Lithuanians, according to February 14, 2005 my father’s story, took him to their <span class="BUILDING">outpost</span> , gave him his watch and gave him his money, gave him his shoes, and was kind of held there for overnight, and in the morning, not knowing what his fate would be, the -- the captain, who was somewhat educated, said, we’ve been thinking about your situation and what we’ve decided is that we’re going to ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And based on your answer to this question, quite frankly, we’re either going to sh -- let you go or shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Which was -- kind of concentrated his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So the question, which my father repeated in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> is, or was -- [speaks Lithuanian here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Is Roosevelt -- President Roosevelt a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And my father’s response, according to my father was, what a silly question, why would you ask me a question like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Everybody knows Roosevelt’s Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And then they said, all right, get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And he walked in the snow in his socks and somehow made it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So that -- I think that story is worth mem-memorializing because it epitomizes -- you say in Polish [speaks Polish here], which means, yi -- it was such a time, which never existed before and will never exist again. [</span><span class="sentence" id="194">speaks Polish here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And that was a -- a vignette from that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  So then he got back to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Yeah, then -- o-of course there was -- there were -- he was looking to get -- I mean, knowing that the Soviets were tightening their noose around the -- Li- February 14, 2005 <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and that it was an unhealthy <span class="NPIP">place</span> to -- to remain and of course the story of the Lithuanian Jews is a very sad story, very few, if any, survived after the Germans invaded in June of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So in that winter, he en -- made a really great effort to try to get out and we were very fortunate that through a strange series of circumstances we were able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And it -- we may be described as a trifecta 1- in the sense that there were three elements to -- to it, and if any of the three elements failed, we would have not survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The first element was a -- a Dutchman who was the honorary consul of the Dutch government in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and whose job was to sell Philips radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And he decided that anyone who applied could get <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> which was then a <span class="REGION">Dutch colony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Course, what was not known is that the governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> was not allowing anybody to get in, but you could get a piece of paper that said you had residence status or invitation to become a resident of the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And with that piece of paper you could then seek transit visas to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You needed basically three visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">You needed a Russian -- Soviet visa, you needed a Japanese visa, then you needed to cross the Atlantic and get an American visa to get you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So there was in- and this is very well known and we don’t have to go into detail about this, there was a Japanese council in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , in the Lithuanian capital, kow -- kow -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kowsis</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">February 14, 2005
QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> -- named Sigahura, who -- who I -- whose widow I met at the <span class="BUILDING">Japanese embassy</span> some years ago, and who issued 2200 of -- of these transit visas to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , which he did wi -- against the express orders of the Japanese foreign ministry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> -- to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And our names and the record 1s there, it’s on the internet, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We got three of these, and with that -- that was two -- two parts of the trifecta. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The third part -- and this part is less well known and deserves to be discussed in some detail, was to get the Soviet -- permission from the Soviets to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> and to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they were selling a package deal, where you got the visa, and the ticket on the Trans-Siberian railroad, which at that ttme was something like a 16 day trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladivostok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And if you ask what I remember, I remember that trip very vividly, because it was 1n the winter of 1940, and it was very cold, and I guess I was tur -- just turning five. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So the first problem was how to get -- because the Soviets said, the only way you could get this -- and we needed 600 dollars for three visas, the only way you get six -- the only -- excuse me, the only way the Soviets would do business with you was in dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And any resident of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> who was caught with dollars on his or her possession was automatically shipped to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , but not with a visa, and so it was a kind of a catch 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You needed the dollars in order to get the visas, but if you had the dollars that was February 14, 2005 prima facie evidence that you were -- had illegal currency and you were subject to immediate arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">My father -- I don’t know if this is part of this -- I guess, surviving the Holocaust, so we can go wi -- through this if you like. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">My father came up with an ingenious plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He had a double envelope. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He put the money in an envelope, and in the o -- in the outer envelope he said, this money is to be used solely and only for the purpose of attaining three exit visas and tr-tr -- or rather, transit visas to -- through the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And some of these visas were granted, and some people were arrested, as I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And some visas were not granted, but they were not arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Almost all the interviews took place around three or four in the morning tha -- you were summoned to the <span class="BUILDING">KGB headquarters</span> where all this was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Vilnius</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And among the questions that were asked was, if you do go to the new world, if you do get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , w-would you be interested in helping us, helping the great Soviet Union complete its mission of liberating the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In other words, would you s -- become a -- a spy, or an agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So this was a very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And the third part of this trifecta, I think my father is proudest of having navigated that particular rapids. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And so we did get those visas, and we did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , I do remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> in 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Let’s back up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So you’re -- before you get onto the Trans-Siberian railroad, do you have any other memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">February 14, 2005
ANSWER:  Well, just the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that we lived in, and eating a lot of bread and salami, which I -- and cheese, which is what I think we survived on. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And I have some pictures I think, still, of -- one or two pictures of that would -- somehow survived from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Oh, there was also a -- a document which has survived, asking my father to bring back some kind of salamis or something from -- from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I guess, I don’t know, but there was -- there was a -- a request for, you know, send -- send food back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , so -- from -- from a Japanese diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">It was all a very strange time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  And what -- was it a fearful time for you as a young child? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And -- and if so, did your parents explain then what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I have to stress it was not fearful for me, I felt quite safe, and 1-1-1s- | had a sense of adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I mean, I -- one of my memories 1s, as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladivostok</span> and we were being carried, because there was a considerable distance from the railhead to the <span class="DLF">pier</span> , where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ship</span> was going to take us to the west coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , and being carried by my father, you know, because it was too far to walk and it was quite cold --
QUESTION:  Te-Tell me more about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Train</span> ride was interesting that -- that -- that -- that were great [indecipherable] of ours on -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> wi-with tea, so I -- I was introduced to tea and I -- ever February 14, 2005 since then I’ve been a tea drinker. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And there was also a yeshiva, a whole yeshiva of about a hundred or so of th -- among these 2200 who were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and who kept pretty much to themselves, but I remember the -- you know, the black coats, and the --
QUESTION:  So there were 2200 Jews on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Oh, no, no, no, there might have been at most several hundred, but there were 2200 exit visas issued. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So not all the people who got exit visas got Soviet vi -- not all the people who got -- excuse me -- not all the people who got transit visas from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sigahura</span> made it t-through <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Some didn’t try, some tried and couldn’t and th-the -- the visas were staggered over some time and so the departures were staggered over some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So we were, I think, toward the middle, but I -- th-that’s a -- I’m not sure of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  So what -- when did you actually leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">When did the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> depart? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Do you know the date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Pretty much. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Backing up, we left <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> [buzzer] [inaudible] -- we left <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We left <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> in the latter part of April 1941 on the Kamakura Maru to sail to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Honolulu</span> and eventually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , | think, in early May of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> in December of 1940, and we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> about two months until we got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so that meant February 14, 2005 that we probably left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> around octo -- middle of October of 1940, or about a year after the war began.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  So you were there for almost a year in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  So now you’ ve gotten off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladivostok</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Oh, there’s also an interesting story about that, which 1s that there was a small group of Jews living in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> as traders, who had been there for quite -- quite some time and were [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And the Japanese required a rather large bond, a security bond, or -- for each person who got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , to ensure that they would not become dependents of the Japanese state, or to ensure that they would leave when their Japanese visas expired, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Anyway, they had to come up with a lot of money per capita tax or bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And there -- somehow, there was -- the last guy off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was a Gentile and had somehow got mixed in with this group of yeshiva people and with my parents, who were traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I would say there were maybe 300 people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , that would be about right. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">February 14, 2005
QUESTION:  All the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> were the ones who had been on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  All the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> were the ones who had reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladivostok</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which took 15 days to cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  Wh -- wa -- were there other children on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that you played with or talked to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  I don’t remember any, no, no, I don’t re -- there may have been, but I don’t remember any. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I remember children on the <span class="BUILDING">Kamakura Maru</span> because there was also a -- a <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> that was traveling to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> -- or not a <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> , a circus, and there were tigers and lions in <span class="INT_SPACE">cages</span> on the -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and so I remember playing with the kids and with -- with the wild animals as it were, but -- and seeing how close we could come without getting swiped. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But just to finish, so these -- so my father again, told me the story that this one Gentile fellow, who somehow was also a refugee, but wasn’t affected -- didn’t -- didn’t have the same story as we did, th- th-the Japanese -- th-the -- the Jewish Japanese said okay, we’ll take him too. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">In other words, why -- why would we send him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Even though he’s not Jewish, we’ll take care of him.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, I remember <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">This is, of course, pre-war Japan. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Tokyo</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I remember, in fact, riding in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> , they had green <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> and we were passing the <span class="BUILDING">imperial palace</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> passed in front of the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> , and all of the ri -- passengers got out of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and bowed in the direction of the <span class="DLF">palaces</span> toward the emperor. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And I remember asking my mother why weren’t we bowing too, and said well that’s, you know -- she said something in the effect -- effectively, that’s not our thing, that’s the local thing and we don’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But I remember the <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> Takashima, where there was a 14 story <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> that was -- had a -- a three story slide on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and how exciting it was for me to slide -- walk up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> -- and my parents let me do it, slide down these three stories, so -- that was a time when my father’s main occupation was finding a way out of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he managed to do so by getting a residence visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republic</span> , who were -- at that time the dictator of the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republic</span> , Trujillo was interested in Europeanizing and bringing in educated Europeans into -- into the -- Hispaniola. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And so we were granted three visas, residence visas to the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republic</span> , and on the basis of that visa, we got one week transit visas from the American consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So that when we got off the Kamakura Maru, we could get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in San February 14, 2005 Francisco, change in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and then take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and then take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republic</span> , but we never did that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Did you know you were going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You, as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">No, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I mean, I knew I was crossing the <span class="REGION">Pacific Ocean</span> and I have very clear memories of -- of Pearl Harbor and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Honolulu</span> when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> docked there for a couple of days, bu-but -- before it went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  Well again, I -- obviously you still were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Did the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> mean anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Did <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> have any meaning for you in any sense?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  No, not at all, 1t was just the great adventure, that we were traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I mean, we'd been on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and now we were on -- and living in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> was a lot of fun, cause I was kind of a street kid, and learning Japanese very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And then being on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And that took about, oh, three weeks to cross the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It wasn’t a fast <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And it was a lot of fun, I mean, I would go with my parents into these very hot <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> which the Japanese had, and then you’d get out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and have a cold bucket of ice water thrown on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It was a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I didn't feel I was a refugee in that sense, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Were there other Jewish children there that you played with in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  I suppose so. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I -- I remember playing with Japanese kids, but this was a -- you know, a lot of the Japanese -- a lot of the people in our [indecipherable] did not February 14, 2005 get these Dominican visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Some of them got Dutch visas to go to the <span class="REGION">Dutch East Indies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And they suffered terribly, many of them died, wi -- after the Japanese invasion of what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The ones, the [indecipherable] people, the ones who could get visas to nowhere, when the war began about six months after we left <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and spent the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">None of them stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , I just know anecdotally, while had many privations, basically survived, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Many of them made it to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , <span class="REGION">South America</span> , some to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So it’s literally, I mean, and quite clearly a -- a Diaspora.</span></p>

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Andrew Glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">This is tape number two, side A, and I was just wondering if you had anything more to say about docking in <span class="REGION">Hawaii</span> and staying there for a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Well, these are events that took place 65 years ago, so forgive me, but young people are impressionable, and of course this was what, about six months or so, a little less than six months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, so we saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Seeing the Pacific fleet was very impressive, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">A-All those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">battleships</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft carriers</span> in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Probably not a good idea, but that was where they were, and we -- I think we -- my father must have had some money, a little bit of money, because he chartered a -- or hired a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxicab</span> and we kind of took a trip around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> to just s -- go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diamondhead</span> and -- and see. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It was one of those beautiful spring days that you have in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hawaii</span> , so I have a clear memory of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And then a -- of course a memory of arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> and the <span class="DLF">Golden Gate bridge</span> , and -- but we were there just for a day or so before we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">February 14, 2005
QUESTION:  While your father -- while your parents and you were traveling, did you sense any concern or any worry or any tension about their having to leave their families back in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and were they aware of what was happening there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  Oh well, there wasn’t an -- this was early in th -- relatively early in the war, and while we knew that the -- the Nazis were anti-Semitic and we knew that a lot of Jews had left because of that, we had no idea of the Holocaust, per se, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">My father wanted very much to get his family out because he feared for their lives, this early. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">But he had no direct evidence other than, as we know, the creation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the -- the tightening of the noose, as it were, the -- m-my grandfather never went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it -- they -- when it became clear he couldn’t stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> any more, they went to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span> where they were eventually shot in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Do you know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  I can find out, and my father told me, but I -- it do -- 1t doesn’t -- but h-he f -- they f -- after the war, my father was in contact with people who were there at the time and remembered the round-up and when -- when they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So they were never in -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , they were just hauled out of their -- where they were staying and -- and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Incidentally, I had a maternal great-grandmother who, at the time the war began was 103. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And she ended up 1n a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not too far from February 14, 2005 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and when she was 104, she was doing some, what might be called relief work. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">She was bringing food to Jews who were hiding and something like that, never fearing for her own life, but there was a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">After dark you were subject to arrest or worse, and she was summarily shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So she ended her life with a German bullet at 104.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  So you’re in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and your -- you’ve left <span class="REGION">California</span> , you said, and you’re on your way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was a kid in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and my father an -- tried to find some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He contacted my -- his father’s broker, my grandfather’s broker, who -- I -- I don’t know if they lent him some money, they possibly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">But since my grandfather had millions of dollars invested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wall Street</span> , they -- until he pulled it out, they -- I mean, they wrote a le -- a letter of reference for my father, which he sought to use effectively with the immigration authorities stalling them from deporting him because we were illegal aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And while that case was pending against us, trying to get us to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and started World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And under American law at the time, my father, February 14, 2005 who was a lawyer, as I said, was familiar with American immigration law, and we - and then -- st -- st -- Justice Department had every right to deport us. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But under U.S. law they could only deport us to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we had immediately entered from, which was the empire of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Or our native <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , which was the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that was under German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So they said you had to leave, but there was a catch 22 there in our favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They couldn’t tell us where to go, cause there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And then, during the war, of course, th-there was -- as you know, under the immigration law there was a Polish quota, and that Polish quota for immigrants was subscribed until something like 1960, 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But President Roosevelt signed an executive order that basically said that unfilled slots, that is people who were supposed to arrive say in 1942, but didn’t arrive because they were trapped behind <span class="DLF">German lines</span> , an -- those slots could be filled by people who have -- who are otherwise of good character, never mind how they got here. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And on that basis, I think around 1943, while we were still in limbo as it were, we emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and re-entered as le-legally with -- with these immigration visas that were given to us in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And then in 1948 we became USS. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">citizens, five years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I became a U.S. citizen, 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  What was your first impression as a child of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when you arrived? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">February 14, 2005
ANSWER:  Oh, it was great, great <span class="NPIP">place</span> , my -- you know, my a-a-abiding goal at the time was to become fluent in English and that time I -- by that time I was six, I think and so I didn’t speak any English. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And I picked it up, and both my mother and father worked, so I was very much during that time, a street kid on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And that was fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  What part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> Did you settle in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Well, we lived in -- very shortly after we arrived, we had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at 315 West 74 Street, which put me in the same <span class="BUILDING">school district</span> as you were in, <span class="BUILDING">P.S. 9</span> , although I think under somewhat grander circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But, so I was a student at <span class="BUILDING">P.S. 9</span> , and we lived on what’s known as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Upper West Side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Did you feel very different from the other children, having come from Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And remember, we all had the common experience of the war, that we were- there was rationing, gas rationing and rubber rationing for tires and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And my father was working in a <span class="BUILDING">defense plant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , so the main occupation, the main thought as I had as a child was that of World War II, and that was a common experience with all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Was your mother working?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, they were both working, and I had this curious experience of being there -- how to put it? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">There are children who grew up in very modest February 14, 2005 circumstances and whose parents somehow became wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Or, whose -- or who had parent -- who, as parents were poor -- as children, excuse me, before they became parents were poor, but they made it as adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And so there’s often this business of Edward my son, you know, whatever the kid wants, he can have. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But wi -- I lived in the reverse, that my parents were -- grew up extremely wealthy, and were extremely poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they lived poor, but thought rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And when you lived poor and thought rich -- you think rich, you do certain things that you don’t otherwise do. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">For example, they never thought that it would -- that I should have some kind of babysitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Well, they hadn’t had the money for babysitters, so I just was, from a very young age, I was just left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And that -- apparently survived, SO --
QUESTION:  What kind of work did your mother do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  She was a dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">She learned how to sew, and she made custom clothes for Henri Bendel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  So, did she work out of your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  Part of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Most of the time, though, she worked as a seamstress in -- at <span class="BUILDING">Henri Bendel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  And their English was good also? </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They picked it up easily? </span><span class="sentence" id="394">February 14, 2005
ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Funny story, my father’s ni -- name was Marian and it was spelled -- it was a very common Polish name, M-a-r-i-a-n, and he was in the World War II New York phone book as Marian Glass, and so he would get propositioned by the sailors coming through and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So -- but I remember fr -- and so he changed his name to Martin, self defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">But I-I remember ver -- by clear memories as, you know, seven, eight years old, of playing in <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> , which was a training facility for the army and the navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I would kind of march along with the soldiers who were living in the -- what is now the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Beacon</span> , on Broadway. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And they would march down <span class="DLF">74" Street</span> , past the <span class="BUILDING">Schwab mansion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">Schwab</span> , into <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> , and there was a -- kind of a parade round there, where they would drill and I would become the mascot of these young soldiers who were getting ready to go abroad, fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  Did your -- did you feel different than the other children, or did you tell the other kids where you came from, or did your teachers know, or di-discuss that with you, with your parents?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Would you describe yourself as an independent child?</span></p>

ANSWER:  The only thing I do remember 1s -- and I was about 11, is -- at the -- that time the New York Times had the war news on page two in official communiqués, issued by -- e-every day there was a communiqué by each of the combatant governments, including the Germans, and I re -- I -- I would read that. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And so the war was very, you know, important in that way, and remembered the wa -- the fact that the <span class="DLF">windows</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had masking tape on them in case we were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And so I remember asking my parents now that the war was over, I asked my father, would newspapers still be published. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">That was a serious question because the -- I thought of newspapers as being war news, I didn’t equate it with any other kind of news, and I didn’t see any need for newspapers after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The newspapers were to tell us about the war, and so no war, no newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  So you don’t remember any specific celebration that your parents had that the war was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Well, th -- I have a very clear memory of my parents crying at -- at A-April 12", I think it was, of 1945 when President Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Kind of -- that was the only president we knew, and of course he, by signing that executive order, allowed us to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which was becoming precarious. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So that’s a clear memory, Roosevelt’s death. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And after that I just grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">February 14, 2005
QUESTION:  And then more and more came out about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">How did you -- you or your family react to tho -- that news?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Not really, I mean the -- the -- the thing that affected me most about the Holocaust, frankly, was as an adult traveling to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and particularly being with Jimmy Carter at the Yad Vashem. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And I don’t cry as an adult, but I did cry then, and I was one of a few reporters, and I think Carter may have known my story, or I may have said something to Jody Powell that -- without really going into it, why it was -- it was -- I said -- I think I said 1t was important to me personally to be at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> with President Carter, and would it be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And so I’ve had these adult experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Another one I had of a similar nature was in 1993 when I happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> with Vice President Gore 1-in which Gore and the Israeli president at the time, made a speech a-at the memorial for the -- the Jews on the 50" anniversary of the -- of the ghetto uprising, which was celebrated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and I just happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at the time, not for this, but Al Gore and so on, so I was with Gore. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And a-as a Washington Bureau Chief for the Cox newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And so I remember being very much affected by that ceremony, and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And -- and -- and just th-the thought that with -- with very few changes in parameters, that I could have been in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And, you know, going to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and seeing children of my age walking in that large -- y-you February 14, 2005 know what I mean, the -- the large kind of photograph, blown up photograph of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> coming through and everyone wearing the armbands and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I-I could easily see myself being there and that -- I would end on the note that it was really quite remarkable that I wasn’t there, and that we are having this interview as I approach my 70" year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  So you continued your schooling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">You -- you finished <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and then what happened?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">No, the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> I shared it was on my passport, which said I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">But, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Purposely, or you just didn’t think it was important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  It was just part of my li -- my father, when I was a young adult s-said to me, I have just three requests of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And one of them was, never f -- never go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And the second one was, never buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German car</span> , although I think he said germ -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes Benz</span> , but he meant <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And he also asked me not February 14, 2005 to marry outside the faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Tho-Those are the three -- he said, otherwise you can do anything you want in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But guess which one of those requests I’ve honored in -- in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But we got along fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  So you said you chose to go into journalism, and you thought maybe it related to your experience as a child following the war news?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  Well, just an exciting way of -- of -- as a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> student I worked at the New York Herald Tribune delivering ads and picking up the weather map from the <span class="BUILDING">weather bureau</span> at the battery, and I earned enough money to travel, which I often enjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So I traveled through <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> , didn’t go to <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> til qu-quite later. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But I never thought of myself other than as an American, and the experiences of the war was, I would say quite honestly that I [indecipherable] thought about it until this interview, I suppose I repressed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">People have asked me, why didn’t I write about it, and that’s a good question, I just didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I mean, I was a writer, and I -- I read stories in the New Yorker that have -- about similar subjects that have -- might say less poignancy or even less relevance than my own story, if it were told that way, as a personal history. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But I -- I just didn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And why, I’m not quite -- e-even to this day I’m not quite clear why. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">End of Tape Two, Side A February 14, 2005 Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Andrew Glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">This is tape number two, side B.
ANSWER:  Well, what Ill say is that over the years I’ve gotten to know quite a few Polish diplomats. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I’ve interviewed the Polish president, I’ve interviewed the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , prime ministers and so on, and spent time in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Parenthetically, my father and mother traveled a good deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">My father was an international businessman, but he never returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , never returned to germa -- ne-never returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> quite often, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519"><span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , of course, where were had family. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">An-an -- or they would meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Honolulu</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Easter Island</span> or somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">But I got -- as I said, I got to know quite a few Poles over the years, including the Pope, and so my view of the Polish role during World War II, quite honestly I would say, is a lot more nuanced and quite different than my father’s -- what I regarded and still regard, I suppose, as a one- dimensional view that all Poles are bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So generational-ly we never agreed, but we never talked about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  Becau -- you never talked about it because?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Well, because it was -- I mean, my father’s mind was made up on the subject February 14, 2005 and there was no point in my saying look, there were also Poles who, unlike the ones that you condemn -- I mean, he made a great point for the fact that Hitler felt comfortable cre -- setting up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and to my knowledge, I guess, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but th-that was -- th-the -- that he didn’t feel comfortable in having say, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> or anywhere not on German soil that wasn’t <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And so that -- that weighed heavily with my father, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and others, may -- five, six major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And that, you know, th-the numbers there are very stark. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">There was, at the time that the war began -- I told you earlier [indecipherable] story of our flight, there were 3,100,000 Jews living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And while it’s not -- the numbers are not quite precise, they range between 100,000 and 150,000 who survived out of that total, who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when the war began. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Some had left to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , some had escaped earlier, but of the number that were there, I mean, you can do the math. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It - it -- 1t -- it’s a very small -- and so, that has kind of created in my mind, Gail, a -- how to put it? </span><span class="sentence" id="531">A fact that I have a -- a -- a get out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> free card. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">That e-every day that I live, statistically I shouldn’t be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And so I-I would, over time, as a journalist, I would find myself in some very dangerous <span class="NPIP">places</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> in the middle of a huge race riot, which was more of a National Guard riot, but that’s another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Or in <span class="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</span> with the Soviet troops fighting the mujahideen. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">February 14, 2005 Or in the first Gulf War with the scuds coming over, and everybody kind of hiding, and I felt no fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I -- you know, the reaction was, you know, why -- why were these people kind of afraid that they’re going to die, bec -- and you know, rationally there was a real risk that one of these mujahideen bullets that was meant for the spiznars would hit me cause I was in the -- harm’s way in each of these cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But I felt kind of like who -- well, you know, I’m -- I’m living on borrowed time anyway, so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And so I’m sure that it wou -- it’s not going to happen but if I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> today I would care less about my personal safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  Which feeds into a question I was going to ask you a little later, is, do you think you’re a different kind of person than you would have been if you hadn’t experienced the childhood that you had? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Let’s say that you were born in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and had a very relaxed early childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Is this because of what you did go through that you had these feelings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Well, it just -- as an a -- I suppose as an adult, the realization that I was a survivor and that the chances of surviving statistically in my particular case, 2200 out of, I think 600,000 in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , almost all of whom died. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I mean, the odds of getting out were -- in the first instance out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and in the second instance out of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , third instance not being arrested in -- in the Soviet Union as -- as o-obvious bourgeois, and the fourth instance leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> just at the right time or February 14, 2005 not, a-as many in that group of 2200 choosing to go to the <span class="REGION">Dutch East Indies</span> , it seemed like a good -- good idea at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I mean all -- or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> -- all of those were just, you know, five cushioned billiard shots, to arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , destitute financially, but -- but healthy and -- and ready to, you know, start a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So I think honestly, that realization came to me only as a -- as an adult, or at least as a teenager, not as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  You finished <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and then did you say you went into the army, into the service?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  Y-You’re talking about now, for instance, the New York Times not giving as much space in the paper to what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Does that make you angry”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  No, but it’s been well documented and they -- they didn’t want to be -- a -- a-- a friend of mine, Alex Jones wrote a book about history of the New York Times, and he was the creator -- cur -- cur -- curator of a program at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> that I participated in, the Kennedy School of Politics as a fellow, and of course he has a lot in there about the Times not wanting to identify itself as a Jewish newspaper during World War I, and so that was --

<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Truthfully no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Just -- one of the things, Gail, as you become a journalist, at least in my generation of journalists is that you -- you -- you -- y-you step out of your skin a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You feel that you’re a somewhat classless person and that the very rich and the very important bear no special role in your life to the homeless person, they have equal balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I feel that very strongly, I always have. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And I -- 1-1-in the sense that as a leader, a bureau chief and so on, I’ve tried to inculcate leading by example, that you, in the younger generation of journalists, not to be in awe of -- February 14, 2005 of the rich and powerful and not to be -- look down at anyone who is in trouble or in -- in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or in -- in modest circumstances, treat them all the same, the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And perhaps in my own background, you know, that growing up poor, but with a rich mentality if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">That may have had something to do with why I became a journalist, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">It’s too deep for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  When you go into the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , does it give you any sp -- di-different feelings?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Did you feel a Polish connection to him, being born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  Well, I feel a connection to Poles and -- and I’m Polish, I mean that -- it says in Who’s Who in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , so that won’t go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Maybe the listing in Who’s Who will end, but being born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , well, that stays.</span></p>
