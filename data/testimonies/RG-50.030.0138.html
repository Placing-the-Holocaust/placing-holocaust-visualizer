<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Masha Loen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I lived near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I came from an average <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">In Yiddish they would say Balle Batish, middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My father was a good tailor, maybe would have called a designer here and made a good living and I had two little sisters and one older sister than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We were four girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">One of them was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">There was only three girls before the war, and no boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And what I can tell about my childhood...I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I went to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , called <span class="BUILDING">Kommerz Gymnasium</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I was thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It so happened that I I have a terrible temper and the teacher said something to me and I didn't like it and I took the my book and I threw at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">On accident I think it hit her nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So my grandfather pushed me into a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> somehow and I enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> everyday by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We played games. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We played soccer ball they called in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and we made Jewish friends mostly and in the winter we were ice skating. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That was the main sport of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in the winter for kids and grown-ups too, and like I said, everything was going on just as it 1s till 1940, when the Russians came in first to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They gave us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , the capital back and at that time when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , a lot...we had some refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that had relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> so they came and we helped them with clothes and everything else and I had a Austrian little girl friend by the name of Levine, Anna Levine. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I will never forget that and I came to my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My grandfather was better off than we were and I said, Zayde, I need a bicyclet, you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for my girlfriend Anna. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He said you know, Maraska (ph), I can't afford to buy her a new one but we'll manage something, and you know, he found a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and put on a net in the back, and matched mine...very so much that I liked hers better than mine, and she was a beautiful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">A very well-behaved child. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My mother loved her very much because she thought it was good influence on me and I don't know what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I absolute don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I lost touch with her when I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because I had so much on my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">When the war broke up in 1941, my sister, my oldest sister that 1s four and a half years older than I am, was a Communist, and she somehow came to us and she said run, 01:04: because I'm running. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And she disappeared and we packed up whatever we could and we ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My little sister was, , the little...the youngest, was about six years, seven years younger than I am and we start running and before we even reached about twenty, thirty kilometers...the Germans were ahead of us, and my grandmother was running and my uncle was running, and my uncle at one time was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Memel</span> that was occupied by the Germans and he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and he said, we have to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We cannot stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So we were running, but the running didn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They overtook us, so we snuck very quietly back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> and what I can tell you is it it happened to me I an experience today that with that . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I, we walked into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everything was like blood lying all over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Nobody was killed because nobody was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I don't know how the blood get got there and then the neighbors all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> ... many many Jews got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">In fact later on I heard from the grown-ups accidentally there was there was a head from the child and a breast from the mother standing on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> because the Lithuanians said the pogrom before the Germans even came in, and today of all days I met a righteous Lithuanian woman and admired her more than anybody else that from so many murderers like the Lithuanians, one woman could come out and hide a one and a half year old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I don't know if she got paid for it or what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I didn't want to ask questions but I did ask her and I feel badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Maybe I hurt her, if she had more problems from her neighbors than from the Nazis, because the Lithuanians, like I said, were very very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They collaborated with the Germans in every way and did a lot of things that the Germans didn't do and asked them to do to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">To find one that saved really a child is a miracle and I shouldn't have said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I felt badly later on, because she answered, in every nationality and every religion are different kind of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I wanted to tell her yes, but not so in Lithuanian but I already kept my mouth shut and didn't say anything because it happened as they said...there was the Riga Aktion, there was the Estonia Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Every time they took out...first they killed a lot of...the first thing they killed is the intellectuals in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So being a child I didn't know that, learned after the war, but what I remember is the Riga Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I was working, as an older child. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was always acting like...when the war started I was not going on eleven...I was going on forty, because I had to grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I had to grow up because of the blood that they saw and the thing that was going on and here is my mother with two...with pregnant, expecting another child and I didn't know, you know, in which world I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Am I forty? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Am I eleven? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Am I fifteen? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Sometimes I cried like a baby and sometimes I acted like a grown-up that nobody can touch me. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was untouchable, and what happened is is that my uncle, Menashke Saposhnikov, my father's brother, was one of the leaders of the underground and when the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Riga</span> ghet...and we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It was in my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you went through a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baker's oven</span> and you went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">In fact the underground some of their equipment kept in that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They knew about the Kinder Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I walked at night in the ghetto Werkstatten, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works, you know, what they did knitting and they did sewing and all different kind of things and they came to pick me up to run me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because they knew somehow, the underground knew there was going to be an Aktion and they are taking people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And as we get, as there was an Aktion...first it was the...no, I'm sorry, I have to go back...first there was the the Kleine Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">That was from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and they liquidated the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Then there was the aktion from one section where I lived and that time they took away my grandfather...both my grandfathers, both my grandmothers, uncles, aunts and so on and I tell you something - I could have saved them, but I came too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The Kommandatur, the German command was not far from us and I had a little cousin...my uncle and aunt live now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> ...1t was their daughter,Dveirele, and she came in and she said: Tante Michle...German...poup, poup, poup. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">She saw those German near the Kommandatur, and she saw them with their rifles, whatever they had at that time - I don't remember, and my mother says, and she was, you know, the little flour that she had she was baking...it was a Friday...and she was scrubbing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and said get out 01:10: of my way, and all of a sudden in about ten minutes, the Germans came in with the shotguns and pushed us out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and at that time my father, like I said, he was a better tailor...worked for <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...at that time he was the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> , and he was sewing for him and we got some sign [document] called the Lebensschein. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And that is a sign to be alive and it was hanging in our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> and she yells to me, Maruska, go get the , the...to be alive...the Lebensschein. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So I ran into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I grabbed the Schein and I come out and my mother wasn't there, and then there was a big <span class="DLF">street</span> that they took us to the <span class="DLF">field</span> and that <span class="DLF">street</span> was the <span class="DLF">border</span> how many people they took out, and there were people going by the dozens, carrying children and so on, and I want my mother, so I stand up in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I start yelling...this is why I tell you I grew up so fast... Momma, Momma, Momma...so a German start beating me and he said get off the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I'll shoot you right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I have Judenschein. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You cannot shoot me, like I was something special. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I thought I was something special. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He says get off there and all of a sudden from about I don't know how many feet away to tell you...maybe a block away...I heard my mother's voice yelling Maruska, Maruska...and I run to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">When we came to that <span class="DLF">field</span> where they're they're separating...right, left, right, left...1 found out that one Judenschein can save one family, and I had four of them, because I had three from us and one for my father that was out to work in the brigade, so I kept running around between the people, but they already took away both my grandmothers and both my grandfathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">There were nobody left from my family that was living right there in that section, so what I did is I said Momma, what should I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">She said start grabbing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Start giving them the Judenschein. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My mother always thought of somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">She was a beautiful lady, not because she was my mother, but as I grow up and I don't think I'm that nice and people say I'm a nice person but I don't think so, because I don't, wouldn't have had the guts to tell my daughter to run around with life, life depends on and start grabbing people and giving them Judenschein and then you don't even know if you would get it back from them, but if people were nice enough when we came back on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> , on the good <span class="NPIP">side</span> , they did give me back the Judenschein and this is one day part of my life, of my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And that was the first aktion...that was the second one and then it was the Riga aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I couldn't tell you really one after another because I blank out or I may go back from time to time to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Is that alright?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  That's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  And then came the big Aktion, October 28th, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was...I don't know...I can't tell you dates really and that was called the Grosse Aktion, the big aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And they went from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they told everybody please leave your sick ones at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> wants to hold a speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We want you on this and this <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Leave your sick ones <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everybody has to be at this and this time on that <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So my mother was pregnant and one of my uncles that my aunt was taken away in the first aktion that I told you, had something very swollen on his face and we didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He came with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Some of my aunts were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My mother's sister that we lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was separated from us, but my father's brother and my father's brother that was in the underground kept yelling at my father...he was a painter...and my father took him in and showed him how to sew and he worked with him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jordan Brigade</span> as a tailor, so we came and we came on that big <span class="DLF">field</span> and they start sorting and <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They surrounded us with machine guns and they start sorting...right, left, right, left. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And Hessel, I think it was Hessel his name - I don't know for sure - I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He was the right hand of <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He comes up to my father and says you Bruder Schneidermeister, you brother tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Take your family and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So my father started looking for people...you know for family, but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said what's the matter with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He says oh, he had a toothache. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It will be pulled out, and my father saw that there's nobody from our family so he start dragging people that were behind and in front of us and my mother and me, and he had such a smirk on his face...I'll never forget...and they said all this is your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And my father saved a lot of strangers and we all went and a lot of my aunts went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">A lot of people went away to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> , and what the most terrible thing about the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> is that at night we heard the shooting of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The machine guns were going 't-t-t-t-t-t-t' and what I found out...now these things what I'm going to tell you now I found out after the war...is that they were not shooting one person into the <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They were shooting two or three at a time to save bullets and that were open <span class="DLF">graves</span> and then they would put a chemical over it and burn them, and some people after it got dark ten thousand people to shoot into the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , it took time, by the time they sorted us out and everything, so they didn't have a chance to burn them. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Some of them got themselves out and came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and this is how we find out what had happened, so what they called portable crematoriums in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> and they called portable <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> ...that why when I talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> I don't talk it as a ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I talk it as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , because we did have <span class="BUILDING">portable crematoriums</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We did have <span class="BUILDING">portable crematoriums</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They didn't have to have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They just shot them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">At that time they still had bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They shot them in and then burned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So if they can call a <span class="BUILDING">portable crematorium</span> why couldn't we call the <span class="BUILDING">portable crematorium</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Do you think I'm wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So this is what I call...when I talk to some people where they ask me about experiences, I don't talk really like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is a concentration of certain people that, ethnic people and so on, and I don't call this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because being without food, being without clothes, being eliminated constantly, thousand, ten thousand, five thousand...and then buried practically alive in a <span class="BUILDING">portable crematorium</span> ...you couldn't call this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You called this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and then we were sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Now I want to tell you one story that I always talk about and that's the children aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The children...1 was working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works...everything happens that they, that should happen, like today I'm here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with a broken leg, but that's alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Everything happens that should happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I came to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You see the Jordan brigade, it was moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works and my father was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You know, you would trade some things for some food and the Jordan brigade, it was well-know that it was bringing food into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and would share. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My mother of course shared it with with everybody before she gave it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My father shared it with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So you had food to eat, more than the average person, so what happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works, they had a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They had a <span class="DLF">window</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and everything was...they had it better than anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works but it still was not in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so that day in, very early in the morning, there's a . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You know what...I would like to go out into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in a brigade I said maybe I can bring something in because it's getting to the point that the kids are starving, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And they said...not starving but not enough food to...you know, we did our best. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And he said you know what...I said you have protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">You go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You talk to the Arbeitsamt, to the Komitet in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works, so he went in and it was already late, and he said to me...that one of the men said, he says, you know, Herr Saposhnikov, he says, there is one brigade, a German and six girls to clean up a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...would you daughter be happy to do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He said my daughter would be very happy to do it, so it happened that we left late and as we were walking out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...of course every girl was older than I was, that worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works...we saw some black machines coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but no <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Just painted little white <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I said to the girls, oh, that looks funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">There's something rotten in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Den</span> ...I didn't know about <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ...I was too young to know about, you know, Hamlet or whatever it is...and I said there's something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Why are those machines coming in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I a little panic, keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some people maybe from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or something, so I kept quiet and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">German's house</span> , and we cleaned up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there were six girls and we were six girls...they had two Germans watching us and the brigadier, the Jewish fellow that went with us, so there was no way of us going out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and trade something for bread or milk or things like that, so what happened is that I ......how long does it take to clean up a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , as even if you're weak and don't eat all day and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Still it doesn't take long. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Six girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So what we did is we didn't know what to do...we start dancing and singing and dancing the horah and I never danced the horah in my life, but it was some older people and they knew about the horah and they start dancing the horah so the Germans walk in and said, you're through? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It's time to take you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We couldn't trade anyways so something to bring in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so they took us back and that Lithuanian woman was wrong when she said every nation or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">When we came to the <span class="DLF">ghetto gate</span> , there was like a Lithuanian with a gun, a machine gun on one <span class="NPIP">part</span> and a German about maybe like from here to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> here with another machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">A Lithuanian and a German, and the whole thing, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was surrounded and we walk into the <span class="DLF">ghetto gate</span> and there is none of our Jewish policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">There is none of the same German when we walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was different Germans, completely different, and something is very quiet on that <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> isn't moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Everything was like in slow motion. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And I and a man that was with the Arbeitsamt, the uncle Jankele Goldovsky comes out from behind that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span> near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> where the Germans were standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He said, girls, you came at the worst time. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It's twelve-thirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They are taking away all children, all people over forty-five, fifty he says, and they don't have the quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They're taking everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And as we walk out from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span> , we saw about four White Russians, Germans, coming with machine guns...started, it was a very very long <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It went through, all through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , that <span class="DLF">street</span> where the, where the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And they surrounded us. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They surrounded us and they start walking with us and I know I walked by that little Kommandatur, our little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and I know...oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">My mother is at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Even now I get goose pimple even if I talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">My mother is at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the two kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">What can I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Shall I run? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Shall I make a run for it? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Go see what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And from far away I saw a friend of mine, Susa, with her mother, standing outside a <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I couldn't do nothing and I start giggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I didn't know what happened to me, and the , the German, he says to me, ah, laugh...in German...laugh as much as you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">In a half an hour the sun will not shine for you anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We walked and they take us to this...and there were some big, big <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on that <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they walk us to those machines that I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They tried to put us into machine and one girl practically had one foot up on it, and there was a man...I'll never forget him - Regal (ph) was his name, a German man. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He had his hand in a sling and it's his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we cleaned and he says, ah, nein, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">These girls belong to the ghetto works. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Take them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He saw us from upstairs, where all the Germans were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He recognized one of the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I don't know what he did, and we got four people, four German again...different ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They took us back to the ghetto works, and what I tell you 1s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works....there are two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">One on one side or like <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or like places that work, and one on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and in the middle was like a big, big <span class="DLF">street</span> , and we walked to the ghetto works and we walk in. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">No Jewish policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Not the same Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Completely new people, and they walk us into one of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> and I see some dead bodies, not lying on the...1n between the two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and some guy that I fix a sweater for him - I thought he was, you know, war, how do you call it - prisoner of war, all of a sudden is wearing a German uniform with a with a machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And we walk in to that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and everybody from the people, all the people asking what is happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , what is happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I said, because they had no <span class="DLF">windows</span> out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I said, we don't know what's happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">What's happening here? </span><span class="sentence" id="189">All we know is that somebody told us they are taking away...they didn't say we know...they're taking away all the children, old people over a certain age, and anybody that's sick - they're taking them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I know my father's on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and I know my mother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the two kids, my two little sisters, and I didn't know what to do, and I came to him and he said, oh my, Maruska, he says, come on - I'll take you to your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And the women that were friends of my mother and my brother are dragging me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">She says don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The minute somebody walks out or he beats them up or he shoots them. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I said but I have to go to see my father, I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I fixed him - I told you I fixed him a sweater for him and I was very good to him and he says, Maruska, tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I know you have two little sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Tell me where they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I'll go and help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And you know, sometimes I was eleven but sometimes like I told you I was forty, and my mind start working. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I said oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He's wearing a German uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">He's having a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Even if I I tell him one word...I said you know I don't live with my mother anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I'm grown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I have my own <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He said you never told me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He said would you like to see your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I said, yes, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And again, my mother's girlfriends and my father's friends are dragging me back into the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and I thought to myself, what do I have to loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">My mother and my two little sisters are not there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I want to see my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">and . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And it so happened, like one time a doctor told me I have nine lives...I have to figure out how many more times before I broke my leg again...and he took me to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And you know, the most God-forsaken thing I've ever seen is eight men holding their head on their...hands on their head, walking around and crying like babies because through their <span class="DLF">window</span> , through the <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> break out a <span class="DLF">window</span> , you could see the way the Germans are dragging, with hand grenades...they were opening the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> that children were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They were dragging old people and everyone in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had somebody, had children, had a wife at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or had somebody because they were working for the Jordan brigade and they were protected a little bit with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And what do I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">All of a sudden I turn eleven again. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I put my hand on my head and I start crying and I start following them. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">At three o'clock they called off the Kinderaktion and I and my father stopped running, and I told you before my Uncle Menashke Saposhnikov was one of the leaders of the underground, so they had to run by their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so my aunt was lying and bleeding...they took away his two little boys, and my other aunts were helping her and I grabbed my father's arm and we start running in, and we run into this little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...was a <span class="BUILDING">peasant house</span> where my mother was with two kids, and there is no sound, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And I stopped crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I said, Papa, they're dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Papa, they're "toit". </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And all of a sudden we heard from upstairs, "knock", "knock", "knock", - knock. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And my mother says quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They're not dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And she opened up that little board that she had, and she dragged down the two kids, and they were completely out...I think a little bit over- dosed. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">She gave them <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping tables</span> , and she tells us what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I practically and my father fainted right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And she said, the machines were driving around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and saying, everybody stay in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Anybody that comes out gets shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And she didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So she took these sleeping tablets and she gave it to the kids, she broke open a little board in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">She, she was thinking fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">She dragged them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She put them flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Dragged herself up, tipped over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> so the sand should fall off it because sand came down, and she was lying with them, so when the Germans came in to look if there's children or anybody in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they didn't see nothing and they were already dead asleep and my mother was still lying flat, but they had picks. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they went into the top with the picks. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">In fact one of my little sister was just grazed, and she pushed them from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other, and she was also afraid to push them because in case the sand start coming down but the Germans thought the sand was coming down from their picks. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I 01:32: realize it now...of course I didn't know it at that time, you know, but she was afraid at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And she had a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> that she saw this machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">She saw those mothers taking the kids to the, to those to those machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And people dragging them and the mothers, they didn't want to give the children up, was being beaten or a dog sent on her, and she saved my two little sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Now there was a rumor that...she was a brave lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">She was a beautiful lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Good, brave, and that they don't have the quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It's going to go on again. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So I said Momma, let me up with the children, up there, and you go in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works on my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">She said no, you go with your poppa. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">You're going to be missed and there's going to be something not kosher, and we went away, and she stayed with the children up there, and they called off again the aktion later on and she saved those two little sisters, and I'm selfish enough to think if my mother wouldn't have saved my two little sisters, maybe she would have been alive for a little while longer because she was a very young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Because when we were, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated and we were sent into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , they separated her with the two kids and they took her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">At that time, to tell you the truth, I didn't know what a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> means. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I didn't even know what a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I know one thing is that when they were still alive and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was going on, before it was liquidated, we had to move them. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Don't forget one was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">My little sister Rosale never knew 01:34: what it means to have one piece of bread and a full glass of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And what we did is, those new <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> ...they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> smaller again and we had to move the kids, so the little one we put in a potato sack instead of taking part of her valuables that was left over, and the middle one, the one that was younger than I, we put her hair up, we put lipstick and we put her between me and my father and my mother in front, and we slipped through because we were not far, like I told you, for the German Kommandatur. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So what happened is every time they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> smaller, we had to move them, and the little one was so smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">She was one and a half years old when they liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and what she did 1s, when she saw a German...she knew every German by the name...and when she saw a German she would grab the seven year old and say, let's go , and they would hide themselves in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> in a pair of laundry bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And when they didn't touch them, when they liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...we were on a <span class="DLF">field</span> waiting to be put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...they did not touch them. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But when they did arrive near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthoff</span> , my mother had poison tablets. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">How she got all of them I don't know, and she...father says let's take them because they were separating the men and sending them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and the women and the children sending in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthoff</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">There came out little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with white spots on it, went through a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> or something...I don't remember...everything is not so clear to me...and my mother, the first time she really put her foot down and she says no. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">No poison tablets. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">This time we go with destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">For all the Jewish people are going to go that route. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We are going to go and if one finger is left to one of my kids or if any of us 1s saved, it will be worth it to tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And you know, something flipped through my mind when she said it, because this is the woman that was sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> when we had the refugees in 1941 from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ...I'm going back again...and I was very upset with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We were sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">She just came back from taking them clothes and food, and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about, they were talking in Russian, and I understood Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I spoke Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And she said, you know, those people are exaggerating. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Nobody can do what they are telling the Germans are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And you know, at, as we were dri...driving into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> in those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and she said, let's go where everybody's going, I remembered that Momma said this once at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I was feeling so sorry for Anna Levine, that little Austrian girl, and...but I don't blame her for it because a lot of us didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Nobody...a lot of Americans don't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">A lot of people of the free world don't believe it, so...because she was so good when my father would bring some food from the Jordan brigade and first it was divided between the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Then she would take it from us and send it to one of my girlfriends, her sister had a little baby...she would take away from Rosale with some milk and give it to Gitta's sister's baby, and a piece of...a little piece of bread here and a little piece of bread here and I don't know where everything went but she was the most good-hearted person in the world and this is what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They separated us and they took me in...you know, have you every watched the movie, , that they show the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gynecologist table</span> with all the dirt and filth. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I wrote to the director a letter - 1t was done very wrong, because at thirteen and a half, they put me on one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> to look for gold, and it wasn't a dirty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was completely sterilized, white...like I can remember because that one thing will never come out of my mind, and the doctor was...or whoever he was...was all in white with a mask, and he was looking for gold in me, and that's why I said they were very wrong because the Germans weren't working, they wouldn't have worked in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> like that, a doctor, because everything was white. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">All I remember is white. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">White, white, white, and I remember a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gynecologist table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I never knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Until I got pregnant with my son, I never went to a gynecologist, and even now I have very very bad feelings when I have to go up on one. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It's a terrible thing to tell it in a video, but I have to tell you that, because it's wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The movie was done wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So when J arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and they took my mother away and I couldn't go with her, I didn't want to live anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I just said to myself whatever I do, I don't care anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So they said that they are going to take us to little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> because they need working power. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Again they start sorting, you know...the strong one, the not strong ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But before I go on I have to tell you the story why I have that mark on my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Max, the sadist from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , one of the biggest sadists that ever existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">See, they didn't have a chance to shave our hair, because most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eastern European ghettos</span> were being liquidated, so everybody was coming at one time, so they had time to give us the uniforms, our numbers, but they didn't have time to shave our hair, so I had big long braids, black braids, so at six o'clock...I don't know what time it was...1t was still dark...bare-footed...we didn't have any shoes, Max yells appell, so I asked the woman that had threw us, at night they threw us into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on top of other women... what do they mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Said keep quiet and get out and stand still. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So I stand still and SS and he goes through the <span class="DLF">lines</span> like this, like a maniac. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I'll never forget, and he said, "Du schwarzer Teufel Du wirdst Stubenaelteste" you black devil are going to be some kind of a post of some kind of clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> or stubenaeltester, you know, the head of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And I was still braiding, I'm still trying, still braiding my braid. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I don't know where my mother is. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">With the kids I don't know what's happening here. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">See, I went ahead of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I'm telling you back what happened to me with Max, and I said: "was". </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Takes me, he breaks my head and hit me on the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with my head, and I start bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">As the coming down bleeding and I was so confused I didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Why is that man doing it to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="304">What are those people all around me doing shivering in in striped uniform? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Where am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Where is my mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">All of a sudden I turned thirteen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">What is happening to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And I looked at him with my two black eyes...they were black and big at that time...and I said, and I looked at him and I didn't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I didn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The blood was running and I didn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And that sadist that didn't have a mind of his own thought I was supernatural. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That's what saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Every time he came into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to beat up the women, every time we were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> , he was knocking out the soup from our hand...that little bit of water and ___ that we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He never touched me. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I didn't know why, because at that time I didn't figure it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Now that I'm grown up and I know a little bit of psychology, I figured it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He thought I was supernatural. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">How can I get help? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">How can I heal with a big cut like that and how can I look him straight in the face without crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That means I didn't hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I was supernatural, so he was afraid to touch me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And that's what saved my life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and then when they were sorting out the people, stronger on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , that he was drunk...other people did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So we went and they put three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> to go out to those little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I was in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and then they decided they don't need three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and one of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> they set on fire, and the people start jumping from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and trying to get on the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , and that was dipping the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , and you know, I was sitting in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and watching the boat people and I was crying and my son says to me, Mom, why are you crying? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It's natural thing to people that and David. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">History repeats itself and I told him the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">At that time he was about already eleven and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I don't know how old he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He was old enough that I could tell him, and I told him the story what happened, you know, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> with the three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> when they were taking us to the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">It's all very not clear in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I don't know how to tell it to you, which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> it was and how the people jumped, but I know when I saw the boat people, everything was coming back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">People jumping out of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">People trying to get into another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , so something clicked in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">All of a sudden I realized that something like this somewhere happened to me, and that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And they came in those little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> digging foxholes and I didn't care what happened to me at that time because it was so close when they took away my mother and the two little children and I don't know if they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , if they were taken away somewhere else, because I know they gave them civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So why take them to a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and put civilian clothes on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But I still know that it happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and they...for me they died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Maybe they took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I don't know where they took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And I just didn't want to go on anymore, but you know, in back of mind was one thing - survive, survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So what I would I do is those little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they're always stationed near a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> and in the winter I would break open the ice and I would wash myself with the, with cold water and the tea that they gave us...the hair start growing out.... would rub into my head, the warm tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So Mrs. Gelta (ph) and ves is alive, she lived a hundred and twenty because she saved my life...she was a lageraltester, decided that I was the young...they knew I was the youngest there, that I should work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Peel potatoes or clean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> ...we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">field kettles</span> there for the little bit of soup that they gave us, but I was always clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I always clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I always kept myself clean, and the shoes that I got in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> was already worn out, so I wore a pair of wooden shoes that they got for me and I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they would always...now I realize it...they never gave us normal people for SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They were people that were sick...they were people that were retarded, people that had syphilis. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I found it out after this because at one time a German came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Eingedeutshter Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">You know, a Polish German and he came over and he sat on the kettle and looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And then he came to my step-mother, and later she was my step-mother but she was my mother's friend and he said, Rochele, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I'm going to marry the Maruska after the war, and she was thinking...you know...you should live that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And one day he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for...oh how to say it...for vacation and he came back and he brought back with him some shoes and some meat and bread and he brought me a whole package out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and there were some Jewish girls like our lageraltester that lived Ol :47:50 with the Germans, and they saved a lot of our lives in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> by doing that because the Oberscharfuerer was not bad, because they controlled him a little bit and they lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> by themselve, all figured out for them, and I said to myself, they just took away my mother and my two little sisters, and I will have to do what they do - not on his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So the Oberscharfuerer was standing downstairs with the people on appell to take them to work, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was raised on a little <span class="DLF">hill</span> ...I1 took the whole package and let it down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and it stopped right next to the Oberscharfuehrer's feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They put him in <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">When he came out, he start beating up the women, and I didn't know what to do about it, so all of a sudden the Allies start coming near, so we start walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was the last march, you know, that long march. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And we start going and we had the black SS and with me, I always had a little bit of imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I don't know where I found a needle and I pulled most of my blanket out with thread and I cut off...at that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were wearing red stars instead of yellow stars painted on our clothes, civilian clothes, and what I did is I took pieces out from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and covered the star like a little pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I must have had the talent from my father because I was a designer out here when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ...went to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> ...and I, to open it and close it. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And I thought to myself maybe I will be able to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And maybe I won't be able to run away, so I had that thing, but one of the guys...we called him Willie the Dancer...each of them had a name...he knew that I had those covered somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">How he found out I don't know, so we were walking on the way and that German that I told you, that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you know, the Polish German, he tried and he beat a woman terrible and Willie the Dancer comes up to me and said, Maruska, he says, there is a big, you know...everybody was mixing together...the Wehrmacht, our fronts were going, and my step-mother's, my mother's friend feet, they're already frozen at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Mine were frozen but not as bad because we were walking over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Weichsel</span> , you know, the Ger...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Polish river</span> and my heels were made out of snow, you know, because in the wooden shoes, but after 1t was completely frozen but one good thing about ; none of our people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">None of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They couldn't walk any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We just dragged them. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Everybody dragged each other, so when we came to that...and he came out and he says to me really, let's go over to the...cover your stars, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I want you to go with me somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I got scared to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I thought he was going to shoot me right there, and at that time everybody was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Nothing was to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">If we got a half a potato a day, a raw potato, it was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So he says come with me, but just talk as little German as you can, and I spoke a little bit so we came to that to the Wehrmacht and he introduced me as their Lithuanian Eingedeutschter, Lithuanian cook that cooks for the German, and if he can have some food from them because they took everything away from the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So what we got is we got a pig. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We got potatoes and we got one of those big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">field kettles</span> to cook it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Who can open a pig? </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Who can do anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We cooked up the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The pig was already cleaned, but not very 01:52: clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We cooked up the pig, and we cut it up in pieces and we took it out in basket to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to the women, to give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And as we were giving out the potatoes, that German that I told you about, that beat up the women when he came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , that said he was going to marry me, was holding his gun to hit my step-mother, my mother's friend at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I grabbed the gun, with the basket I was holding with the food, and he turned around to shoot me and when he saw my face, he didn't touch me and he never touched another woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And when they took away the black SS and gave us some different Germans, because they took away the black SS to fight for them,at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> , whoever they can get, , they had us in like in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They were afraid to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They were afraid...they didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So he threw a blanket over to me so I keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I don't know what was going on in his mind, but at that, that time, they left...that time I told my, my mother's friend at that time, Rochele, my step-mother, I said we'll hide you in the straw and what happens happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">You can't go on anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Now this is all...don't forget I am only, not even fifteen years old yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I'm fourteen years old, and we hid her in the straw and she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">A Polish family found her, and it was practically the...the Russians were there already so they were afraid to kill us so they kept us. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">One of her feet, her toes were taken off after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And all ofa sudden, another little story happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> are going around the rumors and I know that my two aunts, my two mother's sisters, were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with Sochne?? _. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">That was...in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was the commandanteur. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">They were friends of the family, and all of a sudden those two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> meet and Sochne works there with the...works with her daughters, and I yell, ; , Where 1s Pave (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Where is Taivele. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">She said that is dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">She's in a in a, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , with a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Perele had come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and all of a sudden I see her daughter's feet bleeding so I drag up half of my blanket and I said bind your feet in it, and I...the childish head of mine, didn't think to do my own feet like that, so then when I told her, so I ran to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> where my Aunt was lying and the German was beating me go back to your <span class="NPIP">place</span> so she was already dead under this straw and I went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and then it fall into my head to bind my feet in my blanket instead of letting them bleed to death, because during the day the snow would melt and then if you would sleep in a <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> , it would freeze at night back to our feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So we always prayed to God that we would sleep in a <span class="BUILDING">cow barn</span> , because it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Can I drink some water?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We'll stop here for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">They're going to need to change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">End of Tape #1 TAPE #2
QUESTION:  OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  So we walked and we walked and finally they couldn't move us any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And they put us put us in a <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheno</span> (ph), and the two typhuses broke out and I was holding on and it's the funniest thing...you can imagine what Germans they always gave us, in the end too...that were the kapo, a German, that came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He said, who is dead should say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And you would get up in the morning and you would find dead people on each side of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">In fact one of the people that you interviewed yesterday, his mother died next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And I walk out...remember in the beginning of the tape I told you my mother would send milk to my friend's sister's little baby...she was a kapo in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and she...all the kapos and all the lageraltesters slept in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> away from the <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> because of the typhuses...maybe they thought they'll survive better. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I couldn't account for anybody else except myself, and I came out and she was standing and the food...around the food and everything and you know, it's a blank her name for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I can't even mention her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">This is how I blanked her out, and I said just give me a ...because I was getting already a temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I felt it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And I said just give me a little bit of the hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I don't want any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">She said, well stay away from me with all that lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I turned around and I walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I couldn't even cry anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And all those things went through...her sister and her little baby and my mother giving the food and that minute everything went through my mind and I went into the <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> and she saw that she did a mistake, and she came to the 02:02: <span class="DLF">door</span> and she said, Maruska, come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Here is some tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I turned and I covered myself with straw, that I didn't want to know about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And they told us that they are going to burn that <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> and there was a little girl next to me, Chajele, that we'd spend the time together all the time, keeping each other, and I said you know that that piece of blanket that I have left over...you still can walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Why don't you run? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I can't walk anymore, and when I heard the yelling, I though they were burning the silo so I covered myself with the straw and I slipped into unconsciousness and when I woke up, I woke up in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that the Russians are taking care of me medically, and before I even have a chance to breath properly, they told us they have to move out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">The front is coming near. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laurenburg</span> (ph), so in that <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> they found some clothes they gave us, and they gave us medicine and we walked a couple of kilometers and they saw...there were two Russians officers driving in a two-horse <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , you know, in the back just two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and I and Chajele are walking and I said could you take us? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And he says no...we shouldn't, but you know what...we'll take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They saw that we fall practically down but we'll leave you out right before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laurenburg</span> and everybody was walking and the shooting was going on, and they drove us up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laurenburg</span> , and the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Now you may think I'm superstitious but now I realize what it was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">There was nothing in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> except one bottle of black berries and it was standing in the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I...so <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , I don't care if it's poisoned , if not. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I'm going to drin...eat a part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Said I'll eat 1t too, and we both fell asleep and we got up and we felt better. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Now I realized that 1t must have been fermented, and we both got drunk on it, on those black berries and we fall asleep and maybe that's what helped knock down with all the medication that we got, and they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">Russian hospital</span> and they shaved our head, because it was all full of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They put a green solvent, and you can imagine...I was forty-five kilo when I was liberated, and I looked like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laurenberg</span> they said said go and look for a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So I...about three or four girls that looked better already that were older than than me...they say come Maruska. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Come and live with us, because the Russian, they're, you know, raping the Jewish girls, the German girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">They didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They were going on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They didn't give a damn who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So and then you had to sign typhus...they didn't even listen, so what they did is they gave me a little bottle of medicine that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> gave me, and every time a drunk Russian, no matter how drunk he was, came in or something, they send me out with my all that green stuff on my head and like this and I walked out like a dead woman, and when they saw me coming they start running. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But then my hair start growing in and I start getting a little better, they said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We can't stand it anymore, so we went to the Russian commandanteur and at that time I didn't give them no . [</span><span class="sentence" id="457">just wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see if anybody's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And we went to the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They said oh yes, we'll send you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they sent us to <span class="DLF">farms</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span> , and there's a story by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span> and there's cows, sick cows and sick pigs and sick things, you know, and they want, needed food for <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> so what they did is they opened a <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span> , where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with it, so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the Germans were playing the piano and the Jewish girls were cleaning the <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> from the cows, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">After the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and after what they went through so in one time it comes, the captain comes to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">He says who wants to go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rickenwald</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="463">There is a veterinarian doctor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and he wants to teach you to be a veterinarian nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">In two weeks he wants to teach us to be a veterinarian nurse, so I am game. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I'm game of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I said I'm going. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I mean, there we were also kept like in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> but not as bad because we had food, we had clothes, everything, but we could never walk from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to another without a Russian soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rickenwald</span> and it so happened...I must read (ph) of my father and I told the Polkovniks [colonel]wife, I said you know, you don't wear this dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">This is a nightgown. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Put on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I said you have so much clothes and I told her all the hair, you should do it, you know, that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I made very good friends with her, and the doctor that was supposed to teach us was a drunkard. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Was very sick, very drunk, so he would teach us about two hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The rest of the time he would get drunk and after two weeks, he gave us a big stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">He said, , I'm a veterinarian nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they put...Polkovnik came to visit one time...this is during the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">This, I'm liberated already. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And he said I want Maruska (ph), Mar...Maruska at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And the captain said, Maruska at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I told you when I telephoned you that I want her at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">My wife wants to talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So he saw that I am good friends with Polkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the milk was delivered and were going to the <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span> , so the Russian soldiers wouldn't get anything to eat, and when we came back, what they did is what they did with the cows that they captured, we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around the lungs...would have the German people cut around the lungs and then the rest they would cut, cook it for the Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">The good ones they would make conserves themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They opened a <span class="BUILDING">conserve factory</span> and send it to Russian and so the cheese, the Russian soldiers didn't get nothing, so they would come at twelve o'clock at night and I would give them the milk and I would give them whatever there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The captain had everything at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , but the soldier had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So they liked me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And Polkovnik liked me, so how does he get rid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He makes me...now remember, this is '45 and it was beginning of '45 when I was liberated and went though it. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Let's say I was fifteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I wasn't even fifteen years old, and they send me as the head of the <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span> , and they send and a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I get the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the woman that owned it, and she got to be my housekeeper but she never was because she was a beautiful lady, and I made up...one thing I forgot to tell you...I'm going to take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I'm going to take revenge of the people, so I was riding a horse, being that I was a veterinarian nurse I had to go to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and see 1f the cows are clean, if the German women are taking care of it, and I saw some children on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I would fly by with my horse and and I was careful not to hurt them, but I thought I had and I walked into a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> and I would, with my boot I was always opening like they did our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and you know after four weeks what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I stole from the Russians and I gave the medicine, because we Jewish people are compassionate people and we cannot see anybody suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Took medicines to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I took food to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Would you believe it? </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And the German woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pommern</span> , she was Polish-German, and she took care of me and I wouldn't let her and she was my equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">She was supposed to be my servant. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">She was my equal and I was fifteen years old and my mind was working and one story I have to tell you that 1s the most fantastic story, that I am writing about my experience after the war with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He came to me one day and he says to me, you know, he says to me I had a lot of, before that I tell you I had a 02:11: lot...there was to clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> not far from where I stayed in ; and they brought...a lot of fliers, majors and captains would come to visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They were boar hunting, you know, and they brought vodka and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and they were playing and when they got real drunk...that that housekeeper of mine, that lady that owned the "gut"[estate], would lock me in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they couldn't touch me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="503">Laughter) You understand what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But they were very close to me, so the captain came to me and said I have a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I said what's your problem? </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He said I need seven horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I said why? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He said because the horses is in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and my <span class="DLF">ranch</span> and my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polkovnik</span> and he said I want seven horses because is coming and only you can help me, because the people love you here and they'll give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I said nobody gives nothing because it came out I think that the Russians cannot take anything away from the Germans, from farmers, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Nothing can be touched again. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">No cows, no horses, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">What's theirs belongs to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Not far from me was also a officer, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish officer camp</span> from the Pole...for the Polish people soldiers, so I said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">On one condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">That you release every Jewish girl that wants to go out of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I said, and I want them sent right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I'll stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I said I'll stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He says no, I'll make with you a deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">For every horse you get me, one girl can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I'll take them to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I said fine, you sign it for me so I can show it to the . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I said I want to have something over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Now remember, this is all a fifteen year old talking and it's the truth, it's the honest truth with God as my witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">What I did is...I had at that time I invited six, six because there were not seven, six Polish officers to a party in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">There were the Russian, a couple of Russian officers came in with vodka and caviar and everything you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The officers had everything and what I did is, they...I said I want you to get those guys drunk, as drunk as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I had six Russian soldiers, seven because we can only get seven waiting on the side...I knew approximately the size of the officers because they came to visit very often, and they send me seven of them...I got them so drunk they couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We undressed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We put the Polish uniforms on the Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They took, they stole six horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">we put the uniforms on. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and I sent them back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the captain had seven horses, because one I had kept for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">From then on, I was in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">He was afraid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">You understand what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Because I had something over him. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But I had the protection of the Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I had the protection of the German people - they like me because I didn't hurt them in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I had the protection of a lot of officers that knew me, the protection of the polkovnik. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So one day I am going with a man from <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , a soldier, riding into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to look over what's going on, and a short Jewish man comes up to me and said, you know somebody by the name of Maruska Saposhnikov and I said . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And that man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grushin</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> , says to me, don't worry Maruska, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Whatever this man wants from you, nothing will be said. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I said I have to leave without nothing or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">He wants to take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">My father is alive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and he wants to take me with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">My father sent him. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Now if you want to go and tell to the captain, you're alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Go tell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But I have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He said not only will I let you go, I will take you there with that gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But I said I can't let you do it, but you know what I'll do. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I said I will write you a letter what happened between me and the captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">You just say to him you have a letter about the secret seven horses from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maruska</span> , I said, and that's all...that nothing, I don't think nothing will happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">But I said I appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we left and I met my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And later on, some girls escaped from there too, some Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">He kept his word. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Some of them were released. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">They escaped and they told me that that guy lies ina <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hammock</span> and it's catered to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Masha they said... at that time I was calling myself already Masha. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Maruska, what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I said this is between me and that Grushin, nobody else and that's the story about the seven horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">As many things I did to him that he didn't know, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">When I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riegenwald</span> , being a veterinarian nurse that I was not...I knew that much, all I knew is how to take analysis, a blood analysis from a horse, and somebody had to hold him, and how to cut around the lungs from the cow, and how to see that everybody, that everything is clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riegenwald</span> after the polkovnik was there, in about a period of three weeks, the Jewish girls are playing the piano and the Russian girls were cleaning the <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But I was in danger from them also. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So I had to run away somehow, so my father found out where I was from somebody and he sent that man to get me out of there, and this is how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , because my father survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And then we had to go to, run away from the AK, from the fascists in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> because you couldn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I didn't speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">My father didn't speak Polish, so how...you couldn't even go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">My father was working as a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">He hardly made a living, but one thing he did is he had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Everybody went to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> from somewhere, one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or another...he wouldn't let them go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Always kept them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It was a big, big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Many people told me before I even came what my father did for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But it was also a beautiful thing that he did and he died pretty young, and what happened is is we had to smuggle the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So how do we smuggle the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It costs a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So Masha went to work in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and made friends with the Brichah and took a transport in 1945...I wasn't even fifteen years old...in July I was fifteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I took a transport with my father and my...at that time she was already my step-mother, Rochele, all through to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> and the AK was shooting after us, and I stopped the people because my step- 02:19: mother couldn't walk that well. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">She just had an operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The people were screaming and I said I promised you to get you across and I will get you across, and I got them across to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But I loved <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ...and I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> after the war and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, and my husband was , before I met my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I worked for the Brichah. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I helped people smuggle from sonnenfeld because I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I spoke pretty good Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Let my braid grow again. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Put on an Austrian outfit into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sonnenfeld</span> and smuggled people over the <span class="DLF">Innsbruck border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> with the Brichah. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Many times were shot after. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And when I got married I think I settled down a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we lost ev...my husband lost everything we had and one thing I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span> and somebody once asked me, how do you like this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I said oh, this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is wonderful, but why...I didn't speak very good English...my husband spoke the King's English and he wanted me to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I said <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again? </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He said remember, when we come come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I won't help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You'll have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Why don't you do it now? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">First my father, then you...<span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I'm tired of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So, but I read. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">He read to me a lot, and when we came in I know what hot means and I know what dog means. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I said I understand everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">It's a beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I have bananas to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Everything is...but why do people eat hot dogs? (</span><span class="sentence" id="612">Laughter) Because that's the only thing I could read. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And like I said I came here and I start working and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I start...I had a small degree in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> that is not great, and I I had an art major so I start designing and I designed knitted clothes for a lot of movie people, because we came direct...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span> we were two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">We came direct to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angles</span> because my husband had a brother here. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">sent us affidavits and he was broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And we had, we didn't get from the HIAS, didn't get nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">My husband was broke because everything was stolen that they shipped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We made it and I love this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I wish it was when I came in '49 the same way it was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But everything changes, but it's still one of the best <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Of course after <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I'm a...I'm an American Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I always was a Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And that's my story up till now. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Except before I broke my leg, before I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you recall that you didn't tell us that you'd like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  I don't know because like I told you, I was a child and with me it comes back in flashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">That's why I never will write a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I talk into a microphone. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">If my husband and my son wants and I'm not here anymore, he can take it, put it together, do whatever they want, because sometimes at night...I have a little poem that I wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">When the Memorial was built, there were some flags put up, and I have two flags of my two little sisters and the flags of my family and part of my husband's family that was killed from the Hungarians, and when they built it, it was the opening and I was co-chairing and I was the hostess at dinner opening and Hausner (ph) was our main speaker, and I couldn't sleep that night and I got up and I wrote a poem and I love that little plain poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I write poetry from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And that little plain poem I love so much, because it tells so much about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">In the couple of little words it says so much so when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> the last time I found a friend of mine that was an actor and I composed some works and I got permission from the Barry sisters to use their music, and we made a little tape out of it and I think your producer has it, 1f you wanted to play it.</span></p>
