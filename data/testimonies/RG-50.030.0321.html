<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I'd like you to start by telling me your name, your date of birth, and your city of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Father Henry Van Den Boogard and I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in in 1915, so I will be 80 in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Maybe I don't look that old, but they gave me some makeup to look a little bit younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I don't know if it works. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">What else do you want to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family and your background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My family went from , a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that was smaller, and my father had a printing business there, and he started a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">That is where I grew up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I went there to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">When it was over my father put me in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the neighbor city and he thought that is a better <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , but I didn't like it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They had brothers there, religious people teaching, and I couldn't get along with the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Everything that went wrong, I was always blamed for it, so I want to get rid of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I didn't know how I could get rid of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">One day it was Ash Wednesday, and we catholics go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> get a little bit of these ashes on your forehead. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I thought this was a nice opportunity for me to miss the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So, I had to go by a later <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">In the meantime I was waiting I thought that cross that they put on my forehead was too little, so with some ashes I made it larger and each time a little larger and later it covered my whole forehead. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I forgot about it and then I went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it was a very cold day. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was in 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">When I came in the <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , all the boys started to laugh because of that cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I had forgotten it and I told the teacher I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> this morning to get the ashes, and he sent me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He said get of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I had to stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And there I got my vocation I always tell because then I decided I don't want to go to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore, but how can I convince my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I thought I'm going to tell him I want to go to the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He listened, so we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I didn't think that I would be accepted because everybody told me you will be back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So, when I came there, I thought I will fool them a little bit and I thought all the boys will become priests but I was the only one of the class who became a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">What else do I have to tell? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was then 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I was accepted there, but I didn't expect and I prayed a lot that I wouldn't be sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because of my conduct. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My prayers were answered I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">That's what I tell in my sermons, that the prayers are answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I asked in my prayers that I wouldn't be sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so they kept me there and I became a priest after 12, 13 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was ordained 1n 1942, and that was 1n the middle of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Before the war -- during the war already, in 1940, in 1942 more or less, there was a Jewish family in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They were good friends of my uncle, and this gentleman asked me if I could help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He approached me when I was still a seminarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He said can you do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I see that it is difficult for us Jews in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with the Nazis and I would like to go hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He was married, and I said I will look into if I can find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Then in the meantime, my uncle found already a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with his brother, Louis Haza, and he had a sister, Anna Haza, and they both were single and they took him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There was a husband and wife and a little daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The wife was pregnant and in the time they were hiding there, the little boy was born, and it was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But what happened to them later, their name was , and I never found out if they survived the war or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">When I was ordained in 1942, it was the last Sunday of July then the first Sunday of August was August 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I said my first mass in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and there was a big celebration in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about in those days about 10,000, now there's 20,000 people, but there was a big celebration, and a parade and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In the afternoon there was a reception, and the mayor came also to the reception and his name was John , and he was very anti-Nazi, anti-German, and he was very sleepy when he came to the reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He said you have to excuse me because the whole night I had to visit Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I didn't know there were so many Jews in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , but he had to tell them that they had to go into hiding because that same night they would be arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And there was a policeman and he was in favor of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He fought always with the mayor because they had different opinions and the mayor was very anti-Nazi so at the end of the war he had to go into hiding himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">That is why I knew there were quite a few Jews in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Then I didn't do anything until I had a brother-in-law, his father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He just got married, then, 1n those days, and his father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so the Nazis made all the decedents who were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they made them German so they could serve in the military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But my brother-in-law didn't want. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He was the husband of my sister who lives here with me now and my brother-in-law, his name was Robert . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He died already about 20 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He asked me if I could help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So, I had to find out where he could go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I found out then who the leader of the Resistance was in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was , In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> and he said oh he can stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And , 1 would like to mention him because he did a lot for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He's not living anymore but in those days everything was so secret he didn't tell me that he had a Jewish family in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> too hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was working with a priest who was a trappist before. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He was still a trappist but they were kicked out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Then he had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> so he became a chaplain in a very large <span class="BUILDING">nun's convent</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But he was only a name chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">What he did was working for people who wanted to go into hiding especially Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He did a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He was smuggling weapons and things like that and finding <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> to keep those Jews alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But he was not very prudent and we thought some day he will be arrested and it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">His name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I didn't name his full name, I knew only as Fonse, his nickname, but not his last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I found it out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">He went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in ; close to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , but he was last seen in the , in the <span class="BUILDING">police office</span> when he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But we never heard of him later. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We didn't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Now, when the war was over, the leader of this Resistance in , he became the leader of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where no Jews were anymore but were just the Nazi prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I was then assistant in the North, but I went to see him in the South and I visited him, I said, did you ever find out what happened to Fonse, I said don't know, and he said I don't know either, but I know of a famous architect and he knows of somebody in the who works there and he was hiding with priests somewhere in the west of . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So, I got the address of the architect and this architect was making a model for a monument in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on the for the freedom we got after we were freed by the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He said this gentleman he works in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">It was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So, I went there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , that was given to me by the leader of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He's a soldier, so when I saw him, it was lunch time, there was nobody anymore in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , only one gentleman and he knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I said how do you know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">He said do you not know me anymore? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">You helped me go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I said when was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I said I have no hair I was a prisoner in and they cut my hair I was bald headed and he had a prison suit on and I was going to be executed in the neighborhood of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> and they brought me there with other prisoners who were going to be executed too but then we were attacked by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English planes</span> and we all left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and could go into hiding in the <span class="DLF">corn field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It was not corn, it was wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We could crawl through the weeds the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighbor town</span> where I was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was during the hours that there was a curfew at night, so in the morning I had to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> to bring some pictures of Jews who had to have false identification cards and there was a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who took those pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He was an amature. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He took those pictures, developed them at night, and early in the morning as soon as the hours were over of the curfew, then I was going to pick them up and bring them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> to have my brother-in-law who was hiding he had to make those 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So, when I went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I saw in a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I saw somebody standing in the suit of the prisoner's bald headed and he called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He said can you find me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I can stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I brought him then to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the brother of Doctor DeBeer, he was a physician, and his brother was a priest, he was in hiding too. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I brought him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So, as soon as I told me who he was, I thought this is not the one who was hiding with Fonse so I was just as far as I was in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I did find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Later on I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I wanted to know so badly where Fonse was if he was still living or not so I had on radio his name if somebody knew about him, his whereabouts to let me know. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So, I got a letter from the abbot of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , he said as soon as you know let us know. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We want to know what happened to him, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I got a letter from his relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> , they wanted to know also where Fonse was, if he was still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But then I got a letter from a doctor in , where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He said I saw when he was dead, I had to make a certificate that he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was killed on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It was two weeks after he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Now there is some monument for Fonse in that <span class="BUILDING">nun convent</span> and he's on the list of the ones who were killed in . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But, now we don't know much about him, but I wanted to emphasize more what , the leader of the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And Fonse , this priest what they did for the Jews because it was never recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Nobody knew and nobody knew the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They never gave the names, but I know, because I worked with them that they were hiding Jews making false papers for them, 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">cards and trying to keep them alive by finding food so I would like to emphases that now that I have the opportunity to make 1t known what they did during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So, that is what I usually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I didn't do much myself, only I did on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> brought i.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">cards to people who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Once I was asked by to bring a few guns in a shoe box on the back of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was living for the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I did it and I put two Dutch catechisms on top of them so if I had to open maybe I thought it could save me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">When I drove back on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> anymore only and I saw far away that there was control by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">People some people had some food they took the food away, and they used it for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I thought, what will they do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">When I go back they will see that I have something to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Then it's more dangerous for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So, I thought, the Lord will help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So, I went through it and when they stopped me, what's in that box and then I got an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I said I don't know what's going on today but the third time I have to open that books everybody wants to know what's in that box. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Then he said okay go ahead, so I was shaking very much but I saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That's what I did, but it got a little bit too dangerous for me there in the South. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They found out what I did, so I was advised to go into hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Okay, I just want to ask you a little bit more about this period in the South. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I'm going to back track a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">When the Nazis came into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">What was the reaction? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  I was in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> and it was before I was ordained and I remember from a <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> we were watching when they marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we were extremely mad because they invaded our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we tried to defend it with only a few days that our soldiers could defend our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but then they just overthrew us. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">There was no end to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We were extremely mad, and then they were going to throw bombs, that was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The older seminarians had to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and we spent their nights and days 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , but what was going on 1n other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> we didn't know too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I only went at night, early before the other seminarians and the teachers they got up. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I went already to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> after the curfew hours to bring pictures and books to the people who were hiding to keep them busy and to have their false 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">cards made. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It was all I knew about the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I didn't know what was going on in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  How did you know about this man who was leader of the Resistance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  There was a seminarian and he worked in the underground too. , </span><span class="sentence" id="151">was his name, and he had relatives in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they knew who their leader was, and I had to force him to let me know who he was and as soon as I knew, it was already before I was ordained, I went to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He was very friendly and he was living still quite a few years after we were liberated, but then he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But his son is still living and his son is now I think he was in those days about 15 years old and he said his father was a little bit crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">In those days he couldn't talk about anything after the liberation about then what he did during the war for the people who were hiding in the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He was so proud of it, but during the Resistance he didn't tell anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  What motivated you? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">How come you decided to take this on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  It was just my Christian duty I thought to help people who were in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I had to do what I could to help them, and it was also because it was for my relative, my brother-in-law to find a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and then I thought I only have to find a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and he was very intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">He knew several languages very well, but he didn't know Latin, he couldn't stand it so I brought him books to study Latin and books from the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> that he could read and I thought that is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But then this leader , he wanted little by little, more and more to do something for the Resistance, so I came very much involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So, and Father Fonse. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Father Fonse I saw at <span class="BUILDING">house</span> very often, and I knew that the only thing he did was working for the people who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He had papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He brought many people over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and after there was a priest also in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He was a teacher, and he had a contact with the underground, but there was not a good contract because the people he recommended to bring to be brought to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , they all got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They all got taken prisoners, so he asked me if I could give the address, so I gave the address of the contact I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">This priest died a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Then when it got too warm for me I had to go there were many priests home because during the war we wanted to go before the war already to the <span class="REGION">Mission countries</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> or <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I didn't care, but we couldn't leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because we were occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They didn't let us go, so I had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work as a priest so somebody found for me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">| became their assistant, but that was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was quite abandoned and there were very poor people living in <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They were digging, one of those things used for fuel, like bread, this dried plants from centuries and they were living in <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> and that was an ideal <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide their people in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There I knew some people that worked with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">For example, a retired nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She was living across the <span class="DLF">street</span> directly her name was Sister Nista, they called the nurses always sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">She was not a nun but this Sister Nista, and she did a lot for the people that were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">She helped me a lot too. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The pastor he acted like he was helping a lot but he was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">He was very afraid so I never told him what I did during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">One day -- can I keep it for later -- is the tape almost finished because I cannot tell too much about the time I was up north. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">One day I had at the beginning already several people hiding and they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and one day two ladies came on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">a bicycle</span> all the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and I don't know how many kilometers, maybe 200 kilometers because it was close to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , and they came and asked me where their husbands were. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They knew that they were there and that I had them hiding and I gave them the addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They stayed a few days and then they went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , but I had a friend, who passed away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , Father , and he couldn't write, so nobody knew where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I said would you please give my regards to Father who is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in the parish and tell him that I knew him well. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Father asked them is there still food in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he 1s, and they said it seems so because he's providing food for our husbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Then I got a ship of kids from people -- should I tell that later? </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Father he collected many kids and they were catholic kids, Protestant kids and Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He chartered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and he couldn't let me know but there was one nurse who came with those kids and the ones who owned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> they went over and started to say , they came over <span class="DLF">canals</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">One day on the first Friday of the month, I was hearing confessions and I saw a gentleman coming in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and he looked around and he saw me and he came to me and said are you Father Henry from the beaugard and I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">He said I am from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Itica</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Itica</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that 1s close to where he was and he said there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Itica</span> staying over night on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and it's full with kids and they're starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">There was no food enough to keep them alive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and Father collected them and he heard that there was still food so quickly I had to find all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , families who wanted to take a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But after that, after I had placed those kids, I didn't know their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I didn't know which religion they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I didn't know anything about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Later on, Jews came. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They all got that address from Father , and then I got a couple of Jews and then I got another couple and then more and more and I never knew if they were Jewish or not, and I found <span class="NPIP">places</span> for them, and there was a baker. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">There was an organization also, an underground organization in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was a Protestant Minister and he belonged to that organization and he could get the rations, the coupons, and I got from him enough coupons all the time for all the people in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But one day he asked me to give him a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I said I'm not going to do that because we are not going to give any names and I don't know their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Then we have to stop to get you coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I said then I'll have to find another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So, I found then a group in , that was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I got in contact with the underground there and from them I got the coupons which I needed until they changed their mind in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was and I got coupons from them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
ANSWER:  When I was there up north, they asked me many times from the Holocaust, can you give any names. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">How people did you help? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I said I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I didn't know who was a Jew or who was not a Jew, but I knew there were many Jews among them, and there were a few who got a little bit homesick, and they wanted to go close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Then I there was no way to travel by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going any more, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , only by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Then I found I could borrow a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> , and then they had little boys who were strong enough for the ride from . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We went to I don't remember, with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">In there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and it was difficult to cross that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> because there was so much control from the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So, I could bring him to with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and then those people who were hiding, those adults, riding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back seat</span> was a little boy but the boy was strong enough to ride back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">That was a whole day riding. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I don't know how far it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I went with six people and it was a distance of a few hundred yards between me and the next one and the next one, and I said, I was in front, when I put my hand on the lantern, that means there is danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">See that you find a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Don't continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I'll find you later, but we didn't need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So, I did it several times to bring people back to ; but had to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I gave there in the hands of the underground and there was a lot of people who worked for the Nazis, the , and they got some tickets to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in the morning and in the evening, and the underground they got hold of some of those tickets and they could give it us. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So, those people were and got a ticket too and walked over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> with those people to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and then they had to find their way. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But they never found out who they were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there was a pastor from , and I became quite popular there because people were saying since Father is here, something is done for the people that went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It was known. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I didn't tell people, but they found out anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Then the pastor got a little bit jealous. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">He said before Father came here nothing was done, so much is done for the people that went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That is why I didn't tell the pastor anything, but later on I had no more <span class="NPIP">places</span> to hide, no more families, then I asked the pastor can I use the <span class="BUILDING">parish hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The <span class="BUILDING">parish hall</span> was not used for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He first said no and I got a little bit upset about it, and later he came to me and said it's all right, you can use the <span class="BUILDING">parish hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So, I found straw to sleep on and pots and pans and everything and then I had so many people because we are close to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , it was at the end of the war and many people could come through -- 1t was a march between our <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and we were about a mile from the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , and once I remember they told me that there were a few people they called , because there was a before and then many people were picked up and they had to work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and they could escape and then they went through the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Then they told me there are a few more, so I thought I'm going to meet them on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Then I saw them walking, and I knew one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He was a former seminarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">He said what are you doing here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">You are not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you are here in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Then they cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They were dirty and full of lice and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They had gone through the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">There was a lot of water and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">There was not a <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So, I said go into <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I come in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> through the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> and you can take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They give some clean clothing and so on and some food and then I'll find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you to hide here. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">What the two of them were I don't know, but the other one he was a catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">His name was Chris , and then there was the one I knew from the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">What else can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I had many kids in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and I didn't know their names and I didn't know their religion but they had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Then I found out there were quite a few Jewish kids among them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">There was one catholic boy and he heard two years ago when I was celebrating my golden anniversary in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , he heard about, and he was one of those kids and he was now arich guy close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He was an exporter of tulip bulbs to foreign countries, and he came to the reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Now, last year or this year he came to visit me, but I didn't like him very much because he was very egotistic and never paid anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He was here for about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I went with him to <span class="COUNTRY">Virginia</span> to cut the time a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I had to pay everything and he was not satisfied with the food that my sister made. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He asked for other food, so I couldn't stand him any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was glad when the six weeks were over, but that was one of the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">That's the only that I knew the name from. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">All the other ones I never knew the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">His name was Chris ;
QUESTION:  How come you didn't know anyone's names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Because you didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was too dangerous to find out the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The names of those kids I don't know if it was in those days that you were hiding them if I knew the names, but I don't remember any. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I don't know if I got the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I didn't know the names of the people we were hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">When you were hiding people, did you just hide everybody that came through, or was there a priority?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  They had to have a note from Father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and he signed it only A.V., Adrian , and then I trusted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But one morning, in the middle of the night one day, I heard the bell ring very little, and I had my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the second floor of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> and I had my <span class="DLF">window</span> there outside and I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and there was a German soldier staying and they had long overcoats, and he said can I talk to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I said what about. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I would like to talk to you, so I let him in, and I thought I have to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He told me that he was a German soldier and that his family was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he said I don't think that we will win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I don't want to fight any more, I want to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He asked me if I could give him the address of the leader of the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I said I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I didn't trust him. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I thought maybe that the Nazis that they sent him over in the middle of the night to find out who are the ones helping the Nazis and the people were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I asked to the <span class="INT_SPACE">pastor's bedroom</span> , he said kick them out, kick them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I gave him food. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I gave him a sandwich. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I said I'm sorry, I cannot help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He left finally, after insisting very much about what the address is. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I don't know any address. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He said what do you do with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Well, I tell them the same thing that I don't know how to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Later on I was very worried that maybe it is the truth that he was a real soldier that he wanted to go into hiding and my conscious was bothering me so much that I didn't help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But I thought on the other hand maybe he would have given the names of the ones that were in the Resistance and they all would be arrested, so I tried to forget about it, but I never could forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">A few ladies later a policeman from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> came directly and told me that it was too much known that I did something for people who were hiding and I had to go into hiding myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So, I went to a couple a brother and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They were single, and they were already older and he was a furniture maker, and I could go into hiding there, but it was not far from the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , my <span class="DLF">bedroom window</span> I could see the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I watched at night all night if I could see Germans coming to the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> to pick me up, but I didn't see anybody, and after a week nobody came so I started again to live in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">That's about all I can remember from the time I was there 1n the <span class="REGION">northern part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Everything was the same all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Helping Jews, helping other people who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">People who were picked up a lot of them who had to work in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who came through the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I had to find <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I had to find food for them and to keep them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">It was difficult because those people didn't get rations, and those people who got rations got very little too, so I had to go to that was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where many farmers, and I went through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> of the moss, no, that dried stuff that they use for fuel, peat, there was only <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> for those small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> over those beams, and there was a shorter way too but there was no control. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They went from <span class="DLF">farm</span> to <span class="DLF">farm</span> and back for some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I got here potato and a little piece of meat so from a baker I got many rations from the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I told you that already. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I did have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I got some money from a girl who was working in the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and her conscience was bothering her I think and she gave me sometimes 100 then 200 , money I used because there was not enough to buy all the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So, I said, I will pay you back after the war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I don't have any money now. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So, when I was on vacation from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and that couple was still living, the baker. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The baker's wife said are you coming to pay the bill for all the bread you got here. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I said oh, I forgot all about it anymore, but she died, but he is still living, and I saw him the last time I was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">He was an old man in his 90s, but he was a good friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Hartman was his name, and he helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He had also people hiding in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I don't know if they were Jewish or not, and I told you about the electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We were without electricity but we still had a <span class="DLF">line</span> outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Now, it's all under the ground, and the Germans they cut it all to the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but the baker still had electricity because he had to bake bread for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">One night I could steal that electricity to have light in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> , but the pastor didn't want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">One day yet very late and they went when it was already dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They said it's now too dark to make the connection, I said no I don't want to sit by candle all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So, but then 1t was in the dark and I couldn't see it too well and I missed it and it was sparking sparks like fireworks, sparks all over, and then I had to call an electrician early in the morning to restore it. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The baker couldn't bake bread early in the morning for the Nazis, but they never found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">But people know now about it, but a few later last time I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , this is a new <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and when I was there in the <span class="BUILDING">rectory</span> were very abandoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I thought I go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to see the names of the <span class="DLF">graves</span> of the people I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">There was somebody working in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and I said, did you know all those people, he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I said what's your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He said are you a policeman or so? </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I said no I'm Father Henry Van Den Boogard. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He said are you Father Henry Van Den Boogard? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He hadn't seen me in 50 years and he married a girl who was a sister of the girl who worked at the <span class="BUILDING">rectory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He came now too to my golden wedding anniversary to the reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">There were about 16 people from that Parish and they had to come all the way from the north. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They had to drive for hours to get there and four hours to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I don't remember too much about those days in the north.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  Let me ask you, when you were in the north, how long were you up there in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  I tried to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I was there until the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">As soon as the war was over I wanted to go to see if my family was still living, because they fought a lot there, and there was no contact at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So, as soon as possible, I had an opportunity once in who was originally his parents were living 1n the Parish, but he was a soldier during the war in 1940, and he was in the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">His group had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and he became an English soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">After the war he came with the people to liberate the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he came to visit his parents in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pick up truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He didn't see his parents for a long time and he heard about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I went to him and I said, are you going back, he was closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of my parents so I could go with him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and bike through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , which soon after the war because I remember on them there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that as evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">There was nobody living any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was a dead <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , not even a dog you could see on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">There we stopped for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Do you have any more questions? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It's easy for me to talk when you ask me questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I am now to the point where I would like to be asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I told all I can remember more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">This 50 years ago, my memory is not too good anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  When you said you were in until the end of the war, do you remember what year you went there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Yes, I think it was in '44 until the war was over in '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">No, I was there longer, a little more than a year, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Very close to the <span class="BUILDING">Rectory</span> there was a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He had a big <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and he was a Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He was from , and he was a Nazi, and he watched us all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I knew that they had to be very careful, but I didn't know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I didn't know what happened to him, but after the war all the Nazis were picked up and punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  You were right near the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so were there a lot of Germans and Nazis around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  No, not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was because there was a <span class="DLF">highway</span> that went through the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where the Nazis were controlling everything that came through, and then there was a side <span class="DLF">road</span> and maybe about two or three miles long and there was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , along side a small <span class="DLF">canal</span> where I lived, where all those poor people were living, and we were not bordered by Germans at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Only they tried to find out later when I found that German soldier in the middle of the night standing there in front of the <span class="BUILDING">rectory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I wanted to have some names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  What about Dutch Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, they were hidden by the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">After the war they were picked up and they had to parade through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with their hands on their head and soldiers surrounding with their rifle and the people were shouting at them and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Also, the girls who dated German soldiers their hair was cut off completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They were bald headed, and so I had some books with a lot of pictures but I lost them all in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> , pictures about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">During the war I didn't know too well what happened to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I knew that that they were put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but I didn't know that they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I heard it after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  When you were going around this <span class="REGION">area</span> looking for food, going to farmers, did they know why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Yes, I had to tell them, but I didn't tell them for Jews because that was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">When they would know that you were helping Jews they would put you in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and kill you, but I said certain people a lot of them were picked up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> to work in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I acted like it was all for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The Hollands were very helpful when a priest came there to ask for food, sometimes they got one potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Sometimes I got a little piece of bacon and so on, but it all added up. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But I didn't want to bring it to the <span class="BUILDING">rectory</span> because the pastor had two sisters living there that took care of him but they want to have as much as possible for themselves, so I went first to Sister Nista across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , that nurse, and I stored them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">At once she helped people who went into hiding, Jews or no Jews, and there was a guy who came there and he was hiding there in her <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the pastor and the people didn't know if he was a traitor or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So, some from the underground came there and interrogated him and they acted like they were Nazis and he said I'm Nazi too, and he showed them the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Then finally he said we are not Nazis, we are from the underground too, and then he showed papers that he was from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , so they didn't know, but they let htm smoke a cigarette and took him <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and killed him with a hammer, and they buried him in the peat and that happened before I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I knew exactly where he was buried and the companies were digging for that peat, they were getting close to that <span class="DLF">grave</span> and I was afraid that they would find him, so I told him they had to go to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I don't know how I told them, but they didn't dig there further, so they didn't find the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I don't know what happened with that body later either because when the war was over, I had a lot of people in the <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  How many?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  Sixty, I think, to eighty, and then they left and then the new ones came in and I told one of the guys to put all the names down, but they never got the paper with all the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">It was difficult to keep them alive to find food. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">When the war was over we just said, I told the pastor I think we are liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They didn't come to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They forgot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , the Allied and I think ring the bell and we are liberated too and then the pastor and I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> over the <span class="DLF">border</span> there was no control any more but there were some Canadians on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in German and I didn't remember much English but I tried to talk to them a little bit and they asked me for an 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">card. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They didn't know if I was safe or not, but we went to the pastor to get some mass wine and candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they had everything planned here we didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That's what happened after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Then there was a band but here you have <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> with band, but there they are adults and they don't have uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">They just get together and form a band, and they came to bring a serenade to the Jews who were hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">Parish hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I remember that they standing there 1n their sloppy clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Their overalls are dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">They are standing there all in <span class="DLF">line</span> , but soon when I found out that it was a soldier from the Allies, he was a Hollander, and he was also at my reception a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I still have pictures of him here and I could just go with him to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , then the Pastor who was a little bit jealous of me because I was getting too popular he got a letter that I was appointed for <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> and he arranged right away for my farewell party. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">When I came back there was a farewell party and I didn't know where all those people who went into hiding where they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">They didn't know my name either, so I don't know, I went to the south and had a vacation and prepared to go to <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So, I don't know what happened later. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Only one I found and he had tuberculosis and he was in one of the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> laying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I went to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I think he got t.b. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I don't know what happened to him either. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I don't know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I did remember it because I went to see him and it was far away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was between him and my parents in ;
QUESTION:  These people who were hiding there, did they hide for a few months and then move on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Some did. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Some did until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Some got homesick and it was difficult for the Jews because they were told they couldn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They were locked up day and night for a long time, and I remember that once, one of the assistants came and he said this Jewish family and they can't stand it any more and they get out at night and walked around and that is so dangerous they bring the people where they are hiding in danger too, and we have to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But I didn't want to have them killed, so there was one of the Resistance to save those people where they were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So, I went to those Jews and told them to be careful and said you bring those people who are helping you into danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I can't understand why you are getting so restless. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">If you stay day in night in that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> you ought to have some friends once 1n a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That was the end of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  Were some of them trying to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and go south through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">That was in the beginning when I was working in the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Fonse he brought many over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There I knew that many people went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they couldn't go via <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I don't know how many but I know that they were helped by the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit more about what you actually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I mean you went to look for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">You went to the <span class="DLF">local farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">What other kinds of responsibilities did you take on and also did you sort of invent what you had to do or were you working with other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  I did all on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I worked a lot with that nurse across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">She was a retired nurse, Nista, and I remember her name very well, but I don't remember the name of that nurse that came with all those kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">She was staying with the nurse, Nista. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">That's what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I did it all on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I didn't want to tell anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I didn't even want to know the pastor or his sisters or the girl who worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The girl who worked there remembers still many things that I was a signet because she was about 17 years old at that time, I think, she came here last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You have seen her I think. , </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She was here for a vacation for three weeks when I met her in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I heard her brother-in-law worked in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> where I went and he said he was the brother-in-law of . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">He told me where she worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So, I went to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">She was a widow now, and when he came -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> we don't wear a collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It's just a tie, and she didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">When I finally said who I was oh, she was so surprised after so many years to see me again and then I invited why don't you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So, she did later. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">She came for three weeks, and she writes me now, long letters with all nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  But you were hiding many people in the <span class="BUILDING">Parish hall</span> so obviously the other people 1n the <span class="BUILDING">Rectory</span> knew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, they knew that yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But they didn't know they were Jews among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That had to be the most secret thing that we had to keep about Jews because that was too dangerous for the people who were helping them and the Jews themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Because the Jews were the enemies of the Nazis, but there were many people who went into hiding because they didn't want to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or they were picked up and were sent to <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and they ran away from there and came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and had to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So, they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and hiding together with the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Did the local people who were not actively involved in Resistance or underground activities, were they supportive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I worked it was quite catholic town. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">In the <span class="REGION">area</span> where most of the people were not catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But almost everybody I asked to hide a couple didn't know many times they were Jews or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They were always willing to share whatever they had with the people who were in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">In those days, the people had pig and somebody came to slaughter the pig and then they used to bring a piece of the pig to the pastor, those women. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They were very uncivilized and they were talking about they called the Nazis the Poopers, I believe, it's better to give it to the pastor than the Poopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I knew they had killed a pig and I went there and I said can you give me a piece too for the people who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I got some meat sometimes, but the meat had to be cut into small pieces to make soup, because it was too valuable to give big pieces to people separately and a lot of bread from Baker Hartman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  Did you have to find clothing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  I went to the south one time and got a whole truckload of clothing and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the south from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tillburg</span> and one of my relatives was the head nurse there and they got all new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and I got about 50 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and it was too much to bring them -- I had to rent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to bring them. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Then I said to the pastor you divide it because I couldn't keep a secret that I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> coming, and then he acted like he was giving it all to the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Sometimes the people asked me they came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, can I talk to the pastor, okay, but they didn't want to tell me that they want to get some of the clothes that I got to the <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> , but the pastor acted like it was all from him because he said nobody's supposed to know it, but he was not very cooperative.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  So, he took some of this for his own purposes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Yes, food more, and clothing, they gave some clothing to that girl that was working there, . [</span><span class="sentence" id="479">remember they selected -- I had an uncle who had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tillburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He had a very large <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> and I got a lot of stuff from him, rolls of material and I brought only a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and I thought after the war I thought I have to travel so much I have to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , but I got papers that I was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> as chaplain, so I could get gas because it was all rationed, and then I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> from somebody who had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> hiding because they were afraid it would be taken in, but it didn't have tires. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But a boy worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he came back with some tires and I gave him a roll of material instead and then I got from him the tires for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Then I went around in one of those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> , and I got more rations for gas than I needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I could help other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  So, there was a lot of bartering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Those things I never thought of it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Now, you asked me and it comes back in my mind, those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">There were many, many things which happened and that I don't remember, but sometimes something comes up and I remember other things connected with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  There was an active <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">There was a girl close to the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> and that girl did a lot of <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and she thought it was sin and then she wants to buy her sins off by giving money to me to help the people who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Everybody knew that I was hiding people but it was not too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Only a policeman he came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> once and said he has to be more careful because he will be arrested and then I went into hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  So, the local police helped you as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  No, they were too afraid, not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Not very much, I got in touch with only one policeman, and I remember that when I told those people hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">parish hall</span> that there was one guy and the other guy, former prisoners, they said he was helping the Nazis and they called it a , the one who tortured people to get secrets out of him, but he was a prisoner himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Then I went to the local police to have him arrested, but when I came back, he disappeared, had disappeared already. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He knew that probably I was going to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  Now, weren't you afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  I don't remember, maybe I was sometimes, but maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I had sometimes people hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> and then we were told there will be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> to come to control and then we didn't have time to hide those people so we were wearing a cossack in those days and we gave them a cassock and a prayer book and said walk in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> up and down like you're saying your prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">You are assistant here. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But I didn't know what religion he was, but I said act like you are a priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Now, some of these Jewish people, some you knew, some you didn't, did you have to teach them how to act like Christians, how to cross themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  No,
QUESTION:  None of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  I think the people where they were hiding told them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  The other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Because most of the people who were hiding Jews they were all catholic and they knew how to handle them and they knew how careful they had to be because their own life was in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They lived very poorly. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where they were cutting that peat they had piles like bread and high as a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> piled up and there they made a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in it and people were hiding and families were living in those <span class="DLF">holes</span> so they couldn't be found. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They never got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I never lost anybody as far as I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Do you have any sense whether some of these Jewish families could in any way practice their religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  No, no they couldn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  You're positive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Later, after the war was over we had a meeting in a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant church</span> for the people who worked among the people in the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">There were several priests and I asked them about it too, and we couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We didn't have any rabbis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  What do you think when you were working, doing all of this, was your biggest difficulty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  I think to keep everything secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Not to talk about it at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the pastor and his sisters what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But they knew that I was working, helping people when they were in hiding, but they didn't know exactly what I did and who I was helping, where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I had to keep my mouth shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">This is sometimes difficult when you get along with those people every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Oh, I fooled them a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I tell a joke, this Baker Hartman, the pastor and his sisters had a little dog, and the dog died and then they got another dog the same size and the same kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But the dog was not <span class="BUILDING">house</span> broken and when you came in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> there was a <span class="DLF">stairway</span> and then the <span class="DLF">landing</span> and every morning on the <span class="DLF">landing</span> there was some dog droppings, so I asked the bakers I said can you make some droppings from bread, dog droppings, they look dog droppings like bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He said, oh yeah I can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">He enjoyed it I thought I want to fool the pastor and his sisters so I put it there on the <span class="DLF">landing</span> and then that girl that came here for vacation , She came down and we were going from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and she had on a duster and had those dog droppings which was bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I said what do you have there? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Oh, Micky did something again, and I took one and I said it don't look too bad to me and I took a bite of it and those sisters -- oh, that I was eating dog droppings. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I said it's good do you want to try too? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I thought the pastor was going to call the Bishop. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I don't want an assistant who eat dog droppings so I told him it's just bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I had it made. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I did those things to add a little bit of entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Did you ever find yourself in a position besides providing the sort of logistical support for these people to have to give them some sort of emotional or psychological?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I had to talk to them a lot and then they were all right as long as I was talking to them, but I don't know later. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Like I talked about that family who were almost going to be killed because they were restless, getting restless. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Almost everybody was restless in those days and it was a great difficulty to keep them quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Then to talk to those people, the pastor didn't go over, they had go to bring communion to those people on first Friday and those people were hiding and they had to go through the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You couldn't see where the <span class="DLF">road</span> was because the snow was blowing and those <span class="DLF">dikes</span> and so on and sometimes I fell in the snow up to here in the snow, and then I had to visit those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I had food with me for those people and rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It was difficult to keep them alive, but I don't remember too much about difficulties any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">You forget about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Did you have time for your regular priestly duties?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Yes, I didn't have too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I had to visit people regularly and I did it and confessionals all at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The people who were hiding, and I had to say mass on Sundays and during the week I had to preach and prepare a sermon and so on, but before that there was no assistant at all because it was a small parish. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But then I came and the pastor knew what I was doing and he let me do it and he didn't bother too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He didn't ask too much either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Now, when you were getting food coupons for example, from these other organizations, I'm curious about systems, how you knew about each other, how many organizations there were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  I knew only very few of the organization in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I knew them through a Protestant minister and he got the rations, and I knew also especially in the south when they were preparing theft to steal those coupons which were stolen, taken away from the Hollanders and they were stolen by people from the resistance and they gave them to us and we could give them to people who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">That helped a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  How did you know these other organizations? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Were you coordinated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The guy in , a guy I got to know through the pastor and also in the pastor of was arrested too. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We never knew what happened to him if he was killed, but there were two priests who took care of the <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> and they knew who was the leader there in . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">| went to him and I told him that they want from me a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were hiding and I don't want to give them, and they said we will take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Then I got coupons from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Early on, a few years before this, didn't the <span class="BUILDING">catholic church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> really come out and protest against the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  More or less after Cardinal DeYoung had a letter read in all the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  It was, I think, '42 and at that time all the priests were in favor of helping Jews, but not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I remember in when we brought some people there to go give in hands of the organization there to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , then I had to stay over night in . [</span><span class="sentence" id="570">had an address from the pastor where I could stay but the next morning I wanted to say mass and he told me to go to that pastor. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He said no the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">There were two catholic priests, but I did remember which one was right and which one not, so I went to the pastor and I said I have to bring some people who are hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Oh, you are one of those, he said, I said the priest , do you want to be arrested, too? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I said who pays for the wine and the candles and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I just wanted to walk away but he let me say mass and I thought I will not go there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">He was not very cooperative, but that was an exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  Do you remember sort of the general reaction when the Cardinal wrote this letter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  I remember that the Nazis, the Dutch Nazis when they found out about it, they went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> and the man did the letter, but they got several letters in case they had to give one to the Nazis then they had another letter to read at the next mass. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">That was very dangerous too, because there many times they were asking us 1n the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , the Nazis came into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and arrest all the men in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And they had to stand there so close to each other and when they had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> they had only a bottle to pass from one to another and they had to pour it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">That was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The Jews the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">They were arrested by large groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">QUESTION:  Do you think that the Dutch Nazis were more tolerant of priests who did not support them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  You were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> as every one else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">They were very anti-religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Against the catholics, they were more or less the scum of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They were not the well education people, the Dutch Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Do you think that the clergy was very instrumental in terms of the underground efforts in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  As far as I know yes, but I don't have much experience of other parishes because we kept everything so secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">We didn't talk to each other about when we were helping people. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Sometimes we found out but many times we didn't even know, but we could, if we had to tell something we could trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Many priests were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Many priests were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">You heard about the priest who took the place of one who was going to be killed and he will be canonized was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He was a polish priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I remember also that there was a , he was arrested too and killed and his ashes are now kept in the <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> in , and I knew him personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I had once dinner with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He is much older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I was just a seminarian when I knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">will be canonized too, I think, because he is considered as a saint.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Was the reaction more anti-German or did people really want to save Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Both. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They felt sorry for the Jews and they found it very that they were persecuted so much, and we hated the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">In the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we had to learn many languages, French, German and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">The kids didn't want to learn German any more so it was out of this, and many <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> give up to teach German because people didn't make the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> work, because they didn't want to out of the hatred for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">This all now changed because the Germans they come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for vacation, to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , but in those days -- but still many are very anti-German because of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  Prior to all of this was there any sense of anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> among church people among regular people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  Not that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Before we had very little contact with protestants but during the war we were fighting the common enemy, then we got together and I got to know many Protestant ministers and we worked together and they tried to help and during the war they were brought together, the clergy of the different denominations. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">In Europe you don't have so many denominations, not in those days, as you have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">You had the Dutch Reformed and the , translated is also a reformed, but it is two groups and they are very, very Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They don't do anything on Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You can't play cards, so they're reformed. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I don't know about the rabbis. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I don't know many of them because in the south there were not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I didn't know there were so many Jews in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> until this mayor told me that in the whole night he was working on finding those Jews to tell them that they had to go into hiding that they would be arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  Were you -- I guess you were in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> , but I'm wondering in the early years, were you aware of all the decrees against the Jews that restricted them and all of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  That came little by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Also, we were rationed little by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">First you couldn't get this, then you couldn't get that. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Later on, if we all came to the same time we wouldn't have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You couldn't buy soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">You couldn't by tooth paste. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">You couldn't buy shoe shine, nothing, clothing, and you had ow when you want to buy for example toothpaste, you had to give first the empty tube to get a new one. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Then they make jokes that when you want to have a new child you have to turn in an old man because they saved everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They made soap from many dirty things and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">You had to wash clothing with no soap.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Now, you went to probably around 1944 so you were in the <span class="REGION">southern area</span> before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Were there other activities there that you haven't told me about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  No, there was more people that I had to contact but I didn't know--we had sometimes English flyers who were shot down and hey were arrested and we had sometimes in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> hiding, and then we had also one of our seminarians was very good in astronomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">He started a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and he built -- what do you call it to look at the stars?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  A telescope?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Yeah, a big one, and we had a <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> which you could open and the Germans they occupied it and they used it to look around for the telescope to see if they could find people that were hiding or something, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">We were in the studying and those marble steps those Germans with those heavy shoes, they came in with the steel under the shoes and we could hear them fall sometimes and then we were happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  How did you know who to trust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  We trusted many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">We trusted Hollanders and we knew who were the Nazis, the Dutch Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">They were very disliked by the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Soon everybody knew who was in favor of the Nazi and favor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  People were taking big risks so some people weren't willing to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I'm sure there were informers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  A few or so but you knew soon what they had done to other people and then like I talked about Father Fonse he was very imprudent. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">He was very hard working. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">He didn't do anything than hiding people, finding food and smuggling weapons and so on, but he talked very freely but he never told me any names. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But I found out many things after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I have a niece in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , she married my nephew and I asked her, because from the Holocaust they were asking for me about details about Father Fonse and she investigated everything and she went everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">She went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and to meetings and so on, and see I have those papers some where and I looked for them and I can't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They are , She did a lot, but she was not born during the war, she was born later, but she did a lot to find out about Father ,
QUESTION:  Did you distinguish at all between Jewish people who converted to Christianity or catholicism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  I know a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">One Jew became a trappist and then a girl also became a nun and they were also arrested and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I knew about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I didn't know them personally.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  When you think of your work with the underground, your own work, what do you think it's greatest failures were, if any, any weaknesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  I think in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> I heard later that sometimes things were discovered, and there was a group working had a book laying and was edited the anniversary, 75th anniversary of the paper that my father founded and there I read a lot about what people did during the war in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , but I didn't know it in those days, but I was not living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I was living in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> , and I was ordained during the war, and during the war we could not go to the missions where I was going to appointed later for <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I didn't know during the last years of the war where I would go, so I knew that I had to do something in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and by coincidence in touch with the underground and that is why I started to work for them, but after the war, so many people in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> talked oh I was in the underground too. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Everybody wanted everybody to know that they worked with the underground, but many people made up things. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Then we didn't care about it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We didn't want to talk too much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">For example, this lady, she's here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> , she wrote a book and she talked to many groups, , you heard of her I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They worked, they did very much for the underground and the father had to watch the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">He had a few daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They were helping people and the sisters were killed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and she got -- many people ask me do you know her, because it goes around here and talks all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I thought many times I did the same thing, but I don't talk too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But she has written books and she's on t.v. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">sometimes and it is like she was the only one who worked in the underground, but so many people -- but many people talk about it that didn't do anything during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They were afraid, but after the war everybody worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  Did you ever have second thoughts about what you were doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Was it really burdensome?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I was proud of it, but I couldn't tell anybody, only after the war, and then I didn't tell too much because so many people were telling stories that I thought, my story doesn't make any impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">My family knew about it, and when I came here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I had a parish in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamsburg</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> and sometimes people asked me what about during the war, and then I told them stories sometimes, and they were more interested, and I don't know, I think that some time people were asked if they knew somebody who helped Jews during the war to write to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and there was a lady parishioner and her name was O'Connor, Sam O'Connor's wife, Helen O'Connor and she didn't write her name but she wrote the Post Office Box 53 and I remember that I found out who that was, it was Helen O'Connor and she worked that I did work for the Jews during the wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">That is why they contacted me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with the or something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">You know him, because you talked about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I was in correspondence with him for a while, and through him I got that award.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  That was the contact I think with Father Fonse and and also what I did in , but the South I was more indirect helping by bringing photographs at night as soon as the curfew was over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> , and then I came back on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and before they got up in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> I walked like nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I walked through the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> for the morning prayers and I had been already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenthau</span> a half an hour driving, riding on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So, I was proud of that and later on when I had to go into hiding in the north, I had to abandon all that work I did in the south, I told the director of the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> , I said I have to confess something. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">He was glad to hear it but he didn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I said now I have to have a successor and I wanted to have Father . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I said I told him already about it, and he said I don't want him to do it, because he's not secretive enough, but I said I told him already and I gave him the address and he goes if this my brother-in-law and the leader of the underground nothing could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So, when they war was over they made him chaplain, Army chaplain, and then he went with the Dutch Army to <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> and then he came and they didn't know what to do with him so they sent me to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but I didn't do anything here. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So, I was the assistant of provincial. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They said we have to send him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> then they made a pass through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he died last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  During this period of time, did you do things that you never would have imagined you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">ANSWER:  Yes, all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I would never have imagined that I would have worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and helping people to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We were not prepared for that, and I had to do it all on my own almost, especially in the north. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">There was not very much organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">That's what our people said, when the Father came, Father Henry, something is done for the people in hiding, but the pastor didn't do anything, and that is why the pastor became jealous. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It was not a happy time there in ; means <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">That was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the pastor -- he had no sense of humor and so on and I had to hide many things from him and he let me do things, but I don't know if he agreed on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  What was it in your makeup that enabled you to do what you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">What prepared you, I mean you weren't prepared to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , but what drove you that didn't drive that pastor and some other people in your background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  I think the pastor was too afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  What about you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I was in the late twenties and I had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I was glad that I got that appointment is what made it a good covering to hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I was proud of it, but I didn't tell anybody, but there was still a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going, but it took me a whole day, and I took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and after a while, it was a little bit before they called it . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">It was the day that the Allies started to invade Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">A few weeks before I went to the north and there if you can find out when it was, when the Allies landed in Europe, was it '44? </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Then I went to , and I stayed there until the war was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  Did you need special skills to do what you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  I thought everybody was doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Every priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">It was not so, but many priests were doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We were in the opportunity to do something, they did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  It didn't require any special talents or personality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  No, you had to be proud of doing something, to fight the Germans and to help the people who were in need. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I have been all my life helping the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> and I was pastor there in the <span class="REGION">slum area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I worked first among the Indians, always among hungry people and then because there was so much trouble and poverty in <span class="REGION">South America</span> that 1s why I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to find help for the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I went around here for many years to make appeals everywhere for the poor in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Then I became pastor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> , because I asked for a parish that I had to establish an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and that's expensive, you have to rent a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">You have to pay the bills for lights and water and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I thought I better ask for a <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> and have an assistant who would do that work and then we can continue the work for the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So, I asked for a <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> and then I got first a <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portsmouth</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , and the Bishop asked me you can make a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">There was one parish, it was a black parish for Negroes and nobody wanted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">It had big debts. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">They let me take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I had to make appeals to take the debt off. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Then I started this discrimination to have a special parish for black people so I eliminated with the help of the bishop the bishop was afraid that there would be some trouble but I asked the bishop let us find out what the people want. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">If they wanted to have another parish in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the Negroes are living because I had a parish in a <span class="REGION">white area</span> and they had to pass many white <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> to go to their own, so we started first with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to eliminate the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and that went through without any difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Then we give them the <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> and they had to pay off the debt. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It was $250,000 and I paid it off by begging and so on, and then I got a parish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I talk to people sometimes when they ask me about the war, there was a guy --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  So you integrated the <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  No, yes the other <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> was integrated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portsmouth</span> but many left the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> because they didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">There was a guy in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , he was a German, his name was Kyle Rudolph and he was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I didn't know that, but I found out later, and he was very rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">He was a multimillionaire. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">He had a business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I can tell it now because he died two years ago, and he had a big business in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He gave a lot of money to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and his sister came once and she didn't like it too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">She said it's to buy off his sins because he did a lot of sins and he was living with a woman but he gave her $1,000 for the new <span class="BUILDING">church</span> I was building. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I didn't know he was a Nazi but I knew that he went every year to Europe but he never went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">He went always to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">He had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Then I found out he didn't have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> anymore because he thought he was sought because he was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">When I gave up the <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> I started an organization to fight hunger in the world and then I went to live with my sister, but this guy, this multimillionaire was 75 years old and the personnel of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> want to give him a party, and they ask me to come and give a speech because they thought I was a good friend of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So, before the party it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of one of the people who worked for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He had a visitor over from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he introduced me to that German. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He said that is that priest who fought us during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I said what fought, what I did in war was helping Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Then he said, they should have killed them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And that is the last thing I heard of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">He didn't want to have anything to do with me, but he continued to support the parish and my successors, they got money from him, and now I told him don't do it, because he is a Nazi and he 1s afraid to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I think that some day he will be discovered by Nazi hunters and then he will pay for what he did, but he invited him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bocco Raton</span> where he had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">He invited those priests there and I had already three successors there and now he died, and they buried him in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , the <span class="DLF">catholic cemetery</span> in the middle where the old pastors are buried and I protested. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I told a priest who was my successor I said they shouldn't have buried him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">That's for a priest but not for an ex- Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Then he said I will show you and he was dug up and put in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">The pastor heard about it that I complained that he was buried there which was reserved for priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">An ex-Nazi to be buried there because they were very fond of him because he got money from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">That is the experience with Karl Rudolph. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Then he was his enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He didn't want have anything to do with me any more after this surprise party.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">QUESTION:  So you carried this with me in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  That was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question about <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> right after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I suspect there were a lot of adjustments after the war between people coming back and the people who were in hiding and the economy and everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  It was a little difficult for many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  As a priest, what was your experience after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  Now, I don't have much experience because as soon as the war was over I went with this soldier in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pick up truck</span> to . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">It took a whole day, and then I heard there I went to the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> and they said congratulations I said for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">They said you're appointed for <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They sent a letter to the pastor when I was on my way to the south, so then I found out I got my letter there that I was appointed for <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Then I prepared myself more to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> then I had to because in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> you couldn't get any textile or so, but I got it in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I can tell many stories about that, too, how we got all that stuff and I had to smuggle it through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Then I went soon to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , so I don't know too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I heard several things for several people it was difficult to adjust. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They were used to adventures during the war, and then life was so quiet and calm and so that is why when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> I was also a little bit restless. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I couldn't get used to that life not to keep any secrets so I asked for a difficult <span class="NPIP">place</span> so I went to the South of Chile and worked with the Indians for a while until I became an appointment for pastor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santiago</span> in a <span class="REGION">slum area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I worked again amongst the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Then they had to build a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">There was no income at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">There was no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">There were 30,000 parishioners so I was sent by the cardinal of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santiago</span> , Cardinal--- I don't remember his name to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to see if I could find help for the poor in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">So, I go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with Bishop , you heard about him I guess and he invited me to dinner and each time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and he gave me some financial help too, and then I got a lot of parishes where I could make appeals and that's why I came here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Later it was difficult to make all the arrangements from <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> for the appeals. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I had to come every year, so I established an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portsmouth</span> and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you want to say about your work or the situation, your motivations, your <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , any of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">ANSWER:  Yes, because as a priest we are I wanted to be a priest first to get rid of that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , but then later on I got my vocation during the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> years, I just wanted to help people, people that were in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So I worked almost all my life among the poor until I came here, but I worked a lot among the poor, and that is why I got involved in the underground I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I got involved there without asking for it, but I welcomed the opportunity to do something especially for people who had to hide from the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">The first thing I heard was from this Mr. , the Jew in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> with his family which was helped by uncle, and then by the mayor who came to my reception and he told me in secret he said I'm so sleepy. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I didn't sleep a moment because I had to go out and find Jews, and then I found out that there were quite a few Jews living in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  Did you know them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  No, because I was in the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I didn't know much about my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I was 12 or 13 when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> and I went there only for vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I know only Mr. and his family who were friends of my uncle, and I heard later that they went into hiding but the brother of my uncle and his sister and that their child was born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">That was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">But that is what I knew of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I was glad when the opening came for a pastor there in the north wanted to have an assistant because it didn't cost him anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I would say mass and he could keep the money and I did work and he didn't have to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I didn't get any pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  Did you know when you were going north that you would continue your underground activities up there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">ANSWER:  I was hoping that I would have an opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I didn't know that I would have much more opportunities up north than I had in the south and up north I was more active directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I found people and I had to keep them alive and I had found work and rations and food and money and <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they could stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I enjoyed doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I was glad that I had that opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">In the south I worked more indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  Anything else you want to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  I'm empty I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I told everything I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Maybe later on I think I could have told that, but at the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">The last days I have tried, before you came, I knew that you were coming and I was glad to have the opportunity because so many young people don't believe in the Holocaust so they now have an opportunity to tell from my own experience that the Holocaust really existed and I was trying to remember things but it is so many years ago, and I'm bad at remembering the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I remember couldn't remember the names in the south of , who did so much for the Jews, but in the north I don't remember the Protestant minister who brought very regularly the coupons to the <span class="INT_SPACE">rectory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I remember he had on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he had a basked in front of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> where he had the coupons always. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I remember those things when I talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">QUESTION:  Did you get any sleep?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  Yes, I got some, yes, but always that I could be arrested and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I knew someday whatever it never came but close. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">When that guy came, that German soldier at the <span class="DLF">door</span> at the middle of the night I never knew maybe he was trying to hide and that he didn't want to fight anymore and I don't know if he got killed of not, but when I think about it I feel a little bit sorry that I did that, that I didn't try to find out more. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">If it was real what he told me or that he was making up things. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I didn't trust him. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But now after so many years, the people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they talked about things which happened during the war which happened to me and that is why 16 people, they are poor people, they came all the way to my reception to the south, and they had to drive several hours, maybe three hours to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  Do you have anything else that you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  No, I'm glad that I have this opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But I was afraid that I would not remember enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I thought you came all the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and I have so little to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Do you think it is worthwhile?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">QUESTION:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview </span>
