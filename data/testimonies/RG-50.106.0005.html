<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well, I guess we were one of the first units into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I remember standing just inside the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , and having the feeling of not only horror, but utter desolation. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What I saw was on my left, was a mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet high, and stretching out maybe 30 or 40 yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The bodies had been soaked kerosene, ready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too soon for them to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">On my right, there were several people that were lying there, and some of them were crawling. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Some weighed 80 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Some looked half dead to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">One of them was crawling towards me, and I said something in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I can't remember for sure, but "Vus Kenneth Tuin Zick Sehelthen, (ph)" and one of them came up and tried to kiss my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The feeling of helplessness and not believing was very prevalent. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The gentile soldiers who were with me were almost in tears and shaking their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I remember one of the survivors coming up and telling me that the Polish SS had run out the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they were getting away. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And then later, one of the our soldiers, who had gone back there, said that two of them had been caught by some of the inmates and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The scene that I described to you has never left my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And when I hear some of these groups that are now prevalent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , around the world, that say that this never happened, this really prevailed on me to tell what I saw, because I will never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We left this <span class="REGION">area</span> soon after. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I guess we had another assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And it was a long time ago, 50 years or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I don't remember what that assignment was between you and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But that scene that I saw at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> will never be forgotten, and I felt that I had to describe it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Just disbelief. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I think nobody ever would have thought of seeing things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Now, I remember our outfit had gone through five battles, so we had seen many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But this was the horror of it and the immensity of it, you know, was hard to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  How much of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Did you walk around?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  And do you feel that because you were Jewish, that your reaction was different than your fellow soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I think that they were also in shock; that they didn't believe this could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Man's inhumanity to man.</span></p>
