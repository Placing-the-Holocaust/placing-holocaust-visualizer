<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were no longer under Nazi control?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well, actually, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , we were in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , about 38 people, when they took us on the death march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">This was the second death march, the first one was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kittlitztreben</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We were there for about a week and then I — I went out with the last transport from August 5, 1999 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I was hiding in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and sudden I heard shooting into the <span class="DLF">wall</span> cause some other people came. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I went out through a <span class="DLF">window</span> , cut myself, and ran in — outside I shouldn’t get shot and they were already a <span class="DLF">line</span> — lined up, only Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They only asked for Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And we walked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> by foot, which it was full glass, probably a half a foot glass from bombing and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And then on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> , put us about hundred or 110, I don’t know exactly, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And people were dying every day, no food, no water, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And we threw out bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But we didn’t have <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to sit or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">When it got more roomy and more <span class="NPIP">place</span> , actually took some bodies to make ourselves pillows, and we sat on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And on the fourth day they stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , which they gave us a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And it was pure salt, this probably meant to kill us off, which I threw away right away [indecipherable] the other people don’t eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And on the fifth day they gave us some potatoes, they stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And then came two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian airplanes</span> , and they started strafing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Every five minutes the two came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">They were there for about a minute, strafing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And on each side of the <span class="DLF">track</span> were German soldiers also, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , and other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">At that time when I ran down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> everybody ran, because we were afraid of the bullets from strafing. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">From another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came a boy from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He was a young — a young kid about 15 years old, and he was a Pole August 5, 1999 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> not as a Jewish guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Says, come on, we’ll be with the Polish people, not as Jews, and you will survive better and we go there, and we have more food there than you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I says no, I will [indecipherable] with the Jewish people, I am going to stay, you can join me. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And we were there a whole night long in the <span class="DLF">field</span> laying around and the bombs were falling we saw from [indecipherable] everything red, on fire, with heavy bombing from the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And this is the last time I saw that boy, he went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">In fact, I think they killed the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> there, and he got killed too, he didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They — several of us got away, but they killed them, because even soldiers, not only the SS, they were looking for us, and we walked all the way til we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> we were very hungry, dirty, and I don’t have to tell you the lice and everything, they ate us up alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And we waited at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> all night long, they didn’t have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We slept on the <span class="DLF">stones</span> there, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Then we came the morning, they gave us hot coffee, bread, and some cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And right away they — we had to give away our clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We were washed and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They gave me two new shirts, clean white shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">This 1s the first time I put on a shirt in four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And nice clothing, and even a pajama, I was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we were in the Hamburg caserna(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We were there for a couple days, and people were just dying in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , sick from typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I was very scared to be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I knew — I saw August 5, 1999 what’s happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I jumped down a <span class="DLF">window</span> , I don’t know if I was sick at that time or something, but something, I jumped out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I don’t know how long I was on the feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But in the morning I — I have, in sleep like singing Czech songs, partisan songs, and when I woke up there was a Russian soldier what woke me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He stood with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And they gave me some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I went back to the — went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there with some other people, we only left 16 people from over 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And then I went out, I couldn’t walk because I was only about around 80 pounds, not any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And after a day, the entire long day, a guy from our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , he was very hefty, he must be the kapo or something, but a healthy guy, he smuggled himself out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , because it was quarantine, they didn’t let anybody out, there were Czech soldiers staying <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the [indecipherable] because a lot of sickness was going, typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Th-Thousands of people died at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And he came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> he had wine, cases and cases of wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And the Portuguese sardines in golden labels, I remember like now. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And he brought in there thousands and thousands of hundred mark bills, which we didn’t have toilet tissue, was diarrhea a lot, and we put them on a hook, on nails, and we put them in — we didn’t know that the money will ever be good for something, how would we know? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We didn’t have any other paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And all I ate is the sardines and the — and the wine drank. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And we didn’t have bread or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And then they told August 5, 1999 me to go to the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">When I went to the doctor and he says, what have you been eating, that you not even hungry? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">First of all, my stomach shrank, we couldn’t eat much. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And he says, you’re pretty lucky, because you could have died from the sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You are lucky that you drank a lot of wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The wine, that saved your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And they gave us food, right away they brought in food, the same food what the army, the Soviet army took. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And this was the biggest, biggest mistake, because th- they came in with the <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchen</span> , and they have kraut with bacon in it, meat, and potatoes and everything so fat, and people were dying like flies from the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Then I heard when you were liberated by the Americans, they didn’t give you no food, very little, because the stomach shrank, you couldn’t eat anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And that’s the reason a lot of people they could survive, died from the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I was very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">When he told me you lucky that the wine — and when they gave such a food, all I ate was a little piece meat, not much, and the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And a liquid. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They gave milk, this I drank, and — for about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And then th — th-they burned [indecipherable] there because they were full with, you know, vermin and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And dead people were all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And then —
QUESTION:  Did the doctor explain to you why sardines were dangerous and would have been harmful to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">August 5, 1999
ANSWER:  No, he didn’t explain, he just said that you were lucky, but they tasted so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Yeah, and everybody ate them, and we drank a lot of wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We didn’t have anything to do, cause we were afraid to go to other <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They weren’t <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but the other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , cause this was actually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And we afraid a lot — I met there some friends, they were sick, from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And a lot of my friends passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And we saw there — there I met a girl from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , she was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> sitting, I warmed myself in the sun, and then I met the girl Truwik(ph) from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dabrowa</span> , they have a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with leather goods, the ver — very fine family and we talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And then came the — they came for her that she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">She begged me to go with her to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And — cause they took young kids there. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I says no, I’m gonna wait, maybe I find somebody or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I saw there guards, huge guards, they took Germans, the SS and other people, cleaning away the dirts and everything, and we screamed at them, we [indecipherable] but we couldn’t do any other thing, and I was sorry I didn’t kill a couple of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But there’s nothing you could do.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  When you were liberated, tell me, what did you look like, and what was the state of your health?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Well, the state of my health wasn’t bad, because all during — all during my being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I kept myself clean as can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">This was the most important thing, not the food as much, but not to run after food to get beaten over a — a pea, on the death march, on a stomped cigarette like people got out and got beaten bloody, that’s how they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I kept away from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I was with a couple people, friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We kept ourselves clean, neat, we shaved, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And I would say I wasn’t very hungry, but I wasn’t sick, I didn’t have no diarrhea like all the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I was watching myself, I was sometimes with — two weeks without food. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But the will to live and the will to live is on the death march because I have the pictures from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That’s what kept me alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Of tor — course I lost them the last day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And what I wanted to live is, I wanted to see, August 5, 1999 particularly some of my friends, and especially when I met a young girl in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> , and I was hoping I can meet her. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That’s was the will to live, to see my family and this, and that’s what kept me alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I wasn't thinking about food never, but just to take [indecipherable] I wanted to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And that’s, I think, that I lived through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And then, as I told you, my sister’s husband came and took me out, and this was sometimes in May around, I would say around the 14 or the 15" of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And we walked through [indecipherable] there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> didn’t go this way, so we went the first time — day in <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we had there a dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Of course, they didn’t have meat, but nice potatoes with the soup, and this 1s the first time that I ate like a person, with a tablecloth and with a real fork and s — and spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The first time that I cried, and I says it couldn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And when I came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was all white linens, I couldn’t believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And I took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> there, went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And the next morning we got up early, and we waited for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so we walked up on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , my brother-in-law, myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We held onto each other, a lot of people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , the first thing when we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we saw on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in every <span class="NPIP">corner</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">kiosk</span> with food, because a lot of people, a lot of people came out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So every <span class="NPIP">corner</span> was a heart, a red heart and the ches — [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And you have sandwiches, donuts, milk, August 5, 1999 coffee, tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And then they told us noontime we should go there and there, we get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So we had soups, and they gave us meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They were so nice, that’s unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I — I just couldn’t — couldn’t think that anybody would be so nice, especially to Jewish people, they know we Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Then after — after being there about two days in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , was about two — about two or three in the morning, suddenly I wake up it was such a thing, about a hundred Polish women came in to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And they were offniks(ph), and [indecipherable] they were good — they were workers from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I don’t think so they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And they jumped out of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">My [indecipherable] I jump down, they grab me by the thing, and in Polish, rough language, where do you think you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">You stay right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But I — they threw my shirt, I jumped down, my brother-in-law jumped down, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Cause they were awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They — they didn’t have men for a long time, this was their desire. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And at that time I didn’t think of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So I jumped down and went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> to wash up, and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> comes a young — a young gentleman, was about 18 years and I think — he ask me if I can loan the cup he wants to wash his teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And I look at him a red hair — a redhead and the way how he spoke Polish, so I -- [indecipherable] do I ask, are you Monek(ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He jumped to me and kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">This was my brother-in-law’s son from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I knew he’s coming and when — when I saw a redhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And so August 5, 1999 we [indecipherable] went back, and then I said okay, I want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and see if anybody’s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">My brother-in-law said, okay, I’m here, we are going to meet up. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">What happened, they gave me money, they gave me ticket from the Czech people. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrive from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> arrive, a lot of Jews came out, guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I ask them where you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">He says, we just came from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I told him I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , he says, are you crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He says, we just had to give a couple bottles vodka to the Russian guards that they should let us out from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">You are not safe there. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They kill people [indecipherable] people, nobody’s safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So I turn back and went to saw my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">He says, I had enough, he says, I don’t like the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They are not any better than — I says, but they liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He says, I don’t like the communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We are going to go over to the <span class="REGION">American side</span> , because the Americans were occupying part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And from there we have a chance to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That’s was te — okay, we packed his son and myself and we went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he told me, by the way, when the guards will come, the American guards or something, don’t tell them you from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because they take you off and they go and ship you to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Tell them you a German Jew, and you going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Okay, when came to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , the Russian guards went off, the American [indecipherable] came in for passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">You know, passport because we August 5, 1999 crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Didn’t have anything and he ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">As he ask where I’m going I tell them I’m from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I’m going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So my nephew started talking to him English, in a perfect English and the same thing my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So they ask how do you know such a good English? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">In fact, they used to have a French maid at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that she spoke to them only French and English instead of Polish, and he knew very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So they took them off from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , who they are, and he says you go, I find you. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So I went by myself and arrived about 12 o’clock at night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">When I got out from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> there were American soldiers sleeping on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> with their sleeping bags and blankets. </span><span class="sentence"

the time I see blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So he gave me a job to the <span class="INT_SPACE">officers’ kitchen</span> , which I help clean pots and pans, help in baking pies. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And when I saw the meats, what they cut away the fat, meat and everything, I says why, this the best, they throw this away? </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The big cans that we filled them, filling from the pies they threw away. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I says, what are you doing, my God [indecipherable] food. </span><span

that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the girls [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So as I walked around [indecipherable] there, one of the officers come over, what do you have there? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So I was really, you know, scared and this, and don’t be scared, what do you have there? </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I said, it’s not for me, you know I’m not hungry, I eat here all the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It’s for the sick girls in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Take this — everything out here. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He took me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , he took me

id="360">And I have the nice experience, because on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was a very sick girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And there were four sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They were the best friends of my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span

class="sentence" id="366">She died late, late in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">When no more girls were there they took us out from there, they couldn’t — so they remained there, and she died there, she is buried in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And I gave a talk before going for the 50" anniversary to Volary, with survivors from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we came for a gathering there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I gave a talk on the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and I gave a talk a

since I was there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with those girls, I was the only boy between 120 girls, and I am going back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Suddenly I hear bursting out to cry, a young lady start to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So I walked over to her and I says, why are you crying? </span><span class="sentence" id="372">She says, my mother’s sister died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So — and she told me the story, and she told me who were they and this and this and this, how old. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So August 5, 1999 when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , was 10:30 at night, I called up Suzanna Budzelis(ph), she worked with me in the <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> in

don’t know, they were younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I says, look, they registered older to be safe, not to send them to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> but to a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And we became good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volary</span> , I brought the pictures of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> and I gave her the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And then she told me her aunt lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , another aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So I took the number, I called her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I says — I called up, she didn’t remember anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I says, so you don’t remember I came there? </span><span class="sentence" id="385">You were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I was the only boy. </span><span

class="sentence" id="389">And he brought me chocolate for — for us every day with oranges, yes, that’s me. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And she burst out crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And we became the best friends that all the time she calls me, every holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Well, I’m going to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We were there for not too long, about eight weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">A lot of the girls went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , one of the girls [indecipherable] we go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> [indecipherable] which I liked it, I didn — no, I’m going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So one of the girls, Regina Chepelska(ph), she is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> , says Moniek, let’s go somewhere, we all the time here, let’s go August 5, 1999 visit other <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zvolin(ph</span> ), a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> wouldn’t go no further because it was demolish, you know, the railroad tracks have a thing, stopped here and we had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And this was about one o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we didn’t know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We asked somebody where can we go to sleep over, an <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> or something, and it was the motorman from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , he ro — he took her — since she was a young girl we told them we were brother and sister, cause we were afraid, we are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He took her on the <span

someone, another Jewish guy there, we are going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Okay, we will meet up. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So I said goodbye to her and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She came back two days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I asked the Rabbi Katzner(ph) to check, I

id="440">So I was there for two days with them and I says no, it’s no use, I have to go where the men sleep, I can’t be with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But we became very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We — particularly we — about eight girls and me, which consider like brother, sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">That’s how we loved each other, not

ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">QUESTION:  — do you ever work with the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1204">ANSWER:  With the public here, not, but I do a lot, I give talks to charities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I gave talks to <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , and I do this about 10 to 15 times a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">I gave a talk about two years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Meade</span> for the army people, which it happened it was the ninth of May, the anniversary of the end of the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Was about 300 officers there present, they wrote me up in the paper, in fact they wrote me up in two papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Well, I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I didn’t talk much about the Jewish Holocaust, because I don’t know who the people are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Gentile — it depends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">In <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> or [indecipherable] I tell them the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Army people is a different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">I wanted to disclose to them, which the army doesn’t know if — the United States population doesn’t know what happened to American POWs during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Their holocaust, which people don’t understand, they don’t know, which I have documents from the second World War that I copied, and it’s everything in the archives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">In what manner they killed the POWs, also death marches, which it’s not August 5, 1999 known that they went through death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">There’s a death march with 8,000 British POWs from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> [indecipherable], they took them through the snow and everything, that I found in the archives, a book from a major, from a British major with the names who got killed, shot on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , they couldn’t make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">So many of them, thousands got killed from the 8,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">This is not known, and the public don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And they opened their eyes when they heard what they did to the American soldiers, how they buried them with the heads up, which you can find pictures in si — and now it’s in — in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> [indecipherable], with the heads up, buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I have a fact, a Jewish soldier, which I have a document with the picture, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">When they — when they captured him they found a prayer book, which they have the army prayer books, the Jewish people, they took away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Then they wanted to take off his ring, and 1t wouldn’t come off from the ki — finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">They took a shovel and cut off his finger to get the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Then they buried them with the heads up, and when the American army came in and they saw them burying the head, they kept them — they kept them from the American army, we should bury them here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">He says, don’t take no prisoners from them, look what they did to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And this is the anger, but today the population don’t understand what the Germans did to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">The — they don’t know that over two million Russian POWs were killed by the Nazis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">There were between three and 400 killings August 5, 1999 every day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , that they had the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> there, it was called by telephone, 91. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">When they called them up, they knew what it 1s, they were dressed as doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">They put them in — they put them into this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and it was just — just like a doctor effice — <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for examine your eyes, the height, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And they took prisoners, a lot of prisoners 1n one time, every night what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And they examined their teeth, they examined their eyes, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Then they took one by one into a next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which it was against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to measure the height. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">But there was a <span class="DLF">slot</span> there, and they put with the heads back and there he got right away a bullet in his back head and this was going all night long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">In the morning they cleaned everything off, they had to have a plumber to unplug from the blood and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">They captured those people, they captured the people after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">What did they do to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I found documents, it’s — it’s — 1t’s unbelievable that the American government could do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I have a document which a German officer, a doctor decapitated a g — a-an American officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">He took his head, put them in a liquid, get off the flesh, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">He bleached his skull, and it — he sent his wife a souvenir for mantelpiece. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">They caught this, and now the German told them, and he wanted to save his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And he was among 45 other German prisoners what they killed [indecipherable] other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And of course, he was sentenced to death by hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">So the Germans were very smart, and very smart lawyers, right away August 5, 1999 got — they got petitions from the people from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which that doctor [indecipherable] decapitated the soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">They got over 5,000 names that he was a good citizen, he went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday, that he has a old mother, how can she die knowing if he’s gonna be killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">He has two small kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">How will the kids live the rest of the life he’s going to get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And a letter included that came from the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> , which I have a copy, a document, which it went to General Clay, which he was the governor of Europe from the American army, if you are going to kill those 45 people, you are not any better than the Nazis, because the war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So they commuted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">Of course they got commuted to life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">The lawyers were so smart, they send in the petition to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , not explaining that they were commuted from hanging to life, but they said they were sentenced to life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And with the same thing with their signatures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So that particular person was commuted to 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">After sitting Landsberg for five years only, for good behavior they let him out free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I have the documents to show. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">What do we say to the parents from that poor soul that he got decapitated? </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">They walking around free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And of course the Cold War there so they did away everything, 1t’s known for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And it hurts.</span></p>
