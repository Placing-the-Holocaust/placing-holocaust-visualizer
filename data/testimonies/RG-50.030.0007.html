<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What kind of work did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  My father was a chemical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Uh we all went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and uh we had a very comfortable existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was good living in those days in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was really was a good life, a good wholesome life. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And uh we had a good social life and uh my brothers were...I'm the youngest of the boys and had three little sisters, and uh we all loved one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Everything was fine, until...until uh 1938 I really did not believe...comprehend what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I remember my mother keep saying, don't be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Come on <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and and uh when you go to the <span class="BUILDING">schul</span> (ph), the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , come right back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we kept the holidays and we had a all around good life and uh people were talking and uh...about the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We saw the brown shirts (ph) and the SS and and and uh sure we weren't allowed to go to <span class="DLF">parks</span> , but we...I all...failed to understand the significance of the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Uh we weren't allowed to uh go to movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We weren'tâ€™ allowed to go to the zoo...Jews uh not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We weren't allowed to uh go shopping in <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We used to go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to buy something. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We had to wait till everybody was served. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We were always the last one to get what we want, if we were lucky enough to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And by by the time I was eleven, twelve years old, I was thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Well, there there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in my uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> (ph), but there were so many Jewish kids that they didn't have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for all the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So we only could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> maybe two hours a week or three hours a week in shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And we had all this...I took stride. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I just didn't...I really didn't understand this whole thing, and nobody else really explained anything to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They would try to keep it away from us...until uh 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The week before Kristallnacht when they start to arrest all the Jews of Polish background origin, they deported them. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh the children were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the fathers were at their place of work and the mothers were in in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> cooking and things, and just were arrested, one after another, put to...not not given time uh to pack anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Took them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...the father in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the mother in the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Nobody knew where anybody was and the children came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was padlocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They sat <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , didn't know what was happening to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Then they grabbed the children, put them on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> until they they worked it out, what was happening and everybody started running for the em...consulate, the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , because the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> ...they couldn't get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They were safe there. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So they went to the <span class="BUILDING">French Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They went to the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They went to the <span class="BUILDING">Russian Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They went to the Danish, Norwegian, Swiss...anything that was near. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So our job was to bring food to these people and take messages, because if the wife was in the <span class="BUILDING">Danish Embassy</span> and the husband was in the in the <span class="BUILDING">French Embassy</span> , we just took messages back and forth trying to seek the families out to tell them that their loved ones were alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That went on for a couple of days, and uh the night...the 8th of November...I believe it was the 9th or the 8th...8th or 9th of November I believe...I never forgot...the uh the uh Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">That is when I really really was hit with the uh with the happenings there. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They broke everything up and like that in every other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They were raping the young girls in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and and dragging men by their beards through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and burning down the <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> and and and and and threw...I remember they threw all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and dishes and everything out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and and and uh beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They came in...the Hitler youth...with their daggers, blood and honor, and punks, bands of punks and they're beating everybody up, taking people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , arresting people and it was just a terrible, terrible night. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It started about three o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">That night they arrested my brother Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My brother uh Bernie (ph), he had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Of course, there was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ...I was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We were hiding in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> but they dragged us out, beat up my mother and the next day it was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The smoke was still coming out of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">schules</span> and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and there was still blood in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Now I knew...now I knew...something terrible is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But I didn't know what to do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I had my mama. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I had my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She was always taking care of us. (</span><span class="sentence" id="66">Sigh) Well, my brother Paul to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My other brother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They were taken, and a few days later they came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from a Jewish organization and they said we can save one child. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Which one is going to live and which ones are going to die? (</span><span class="sentence" id="70">Sigh) My mother had to make a choice and by the time the choice was made and everything, the other one was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Was just left me and my three little sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">A couple of months passed and my mother sent me out for a loaf of bread and I never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came screeching to a halt...are you a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I was sixteen years old...fifteen, sixteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I didn't know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">These were mean looking men. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They put me into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I found myself in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">No explanation was given. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">None was asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , cell number ten. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">My mother wondered what happened to me...send me out for a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> about...[ would say about two months, three months...till May, approximately May. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Suddenly they let me go free. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I had to sign a paper that I was going to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> within forty-eight hours...they will let me go, and that I was treated well. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Again I didn't know what I was signing. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They told me to sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I remember to this day...my mother stay...stood at the <span class="DLF">door</span> of our apart...our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She had ten marks...that was all we were allowed to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Ten marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">She must have had this in cash laying around because all our money had been confiscated by the state, and we had nothing left and she said to me, you have to leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Don't even go into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You have to leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Here is ten marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She says go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that had open <span class="DLF">borders</span> because they are friends with . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Hitler was the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They had no closed <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And that was the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that had an open <span class="DLF">border</span> for Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I had no passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I had no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Here...take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , she says. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Here is a card, a railroad ticket I got for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and go into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and just one by one...don't ever look back. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So I said to her where are my other two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I had three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She said they're on their way to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I sent them with some people, with some friends to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Only Toni (ph), the little one, she had in her arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Must have been about...I don't know...four, three, four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So I said goodbye...I was a good boy so I said goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Mamma said go...I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And uh that is when my life started. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Where was your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  When did...where did he go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  He went into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  When he was taken there...Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Now my mother was alone with my little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">How my mother ever got me out of that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> I will never know to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I am sure she must have bribed a lot of people to get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But she saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So where does one go? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">One goes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> ...we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I wasn't the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">There were hundreds...men, women, children...anyone who could themselves, they went down there. (</span><span class="sentence" id="137">Sigh) We had no food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We slept on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">park benches</span> , in <span class="DLF">doorways</span> , in <span class="DLF">parks</span> , and we like a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , like rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , they got together and they opened up <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> and they got organized and so at least we could have one meal a day, somewhat of a meal a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That was done for a while, a week, two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Then the Germans found out that the Jews are treated to some...to a meal a day, and they they made arrangements with the Italian authorities because we told the Italians that we were tourists, otherwise you couldn't get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We were tourists. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So they let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And now they said if you're tourists, then you've got to have money and if you have money, you don't need any <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> , and if you're not tourists, then we have to send you back where you came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Made a lot of sense to them...didn't make any sense to us though. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They closed up the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">That was the end of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">more than one meal a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So another few days and uh like I always was, I used to climb into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , some <span class="DLF">backyards</span> , and pluck some fresh figs. (</span><span class="sentence" id="151">Laughter) I...I stole some olives from <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , but there was to steal. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was edible and to stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Then the word got around that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> will let anybody in. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The men have to go to the French Army, because war was eminent, and the women had to volunteer for the French Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We said wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We all went to the <span class="BUILDING">French Embassy</span> , and we all got that...the one day flag they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We got a visa to enter <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that was good for 24 hours only. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Well, there was only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going to the <span class="DLF">French border</span> because the war broke out quite a few weeks after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We had to get that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they gave us a train ticket so we went for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Now what that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> looked like you will never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They were hanging out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They were laying on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> ...inside...<span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They...they...they held children out out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They were suffocating inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">There must have been a thousand people or maybe fifteen hundred people on a on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that is good for three hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It couldn't go very fast because people were on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They were hanging out <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171"><span class="NPIP">Outside</span> ...inside and they were hanging on their fingernails. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">People fell off, actually fell off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving so the train conductor didn't go to fast because he saw what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">By the time we got to the Italian/<span class="DLF">French border</span> , it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The French had closed the <span class="DLF">border</span> and there's a little piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> called no man's land and the Italians wouldn't let us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So we laid on that little piece land...there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fishing village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">.St.</span><span class="sentence" id="178">Reno ___...it's right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> . . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It's right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and these old fishermen with these old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> ...they saw a way to make money. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Now these were impoverished people that never had anything except to catch a few fish now and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So they said to us, we'll take you around the bent...it's a big rock...and you had to go around the bent onto the beaches of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> if you give us everything you have and uh pay us whatever you can pay, and we'll load up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We'll take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But what they didn't tell people, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> were old and that the breakers in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> were very strong onto the onto the uh___, unto the stone, unto the uh onto the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> came back out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The waves were high and very strong and very uh uh dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So as greedy as they were, they overloaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Some people had a wedding band, an engagement ring, maybe a few francs, maybe a few lire, maybe a little piece of jewelry that they saved, that they smuggled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They overloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They gave them everything they owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They overloaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They went out a little bit, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> broke in two. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They capsized. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They broke 1n two. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The fishermen swam back. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He has been fishing...he has been swimming since he was two years old, so there were people that couldn't swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Now you tell me...who do you save when you're a father and and your little girl says Daddy, save me, and your little boy says Papa, save me. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And your wife is drowning. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Who do you save...and you can't swim, and the waves are high. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">The next day the the bodies came washing ashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> out there, two uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gun boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">A French one and an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian gunboat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And the the personnel on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , they were looking out and they saw the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Nobody lifted their finger to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The screams of help, please help, help my children, help my wife, uh save us...still ring into my ears to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Nobody cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I met somebody there that knew my family and they said to me, you know about your brother Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I says what. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The word got out.

id="451">Some of them had guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Some of them didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Some of them had grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">One of them had this uh knife, so they looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They pointed a gun at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I says, Iam a Jew on the run. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So one guy said so what else is new. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Have you ever seen a Jew that's not on the run.</span><span class="sentence" id="459">I said __ no. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">He said come. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So they got more guns and he said look, we do some raiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We do some trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">All we can do is like a big...put a sting here and a sting there to the Nazis, but that's about as far as we can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We...we are no match for the armament of the machine guns or for the masses of those people and and their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and their and their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriers</span> and whatever they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We are...but we can give a sting here and there, now and then, so that's what we'll do. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Hurt them and run. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So that's what we did for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Then the word came out there is another group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langlade</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We ought to join them, so we made our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langlade</span> , traveling at night, hiding during the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  How many were there of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  There must have been thirty, forty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  And what were the ages?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Young and old. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">From age...from age nine, ten years old up to forty, fifty. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Somehow they got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Somehow they are lucky enough not to get caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Somehow they were on the run for God knows how long, and somehow they found themselves in that predicament. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Nobody asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So when you're hungry, you know you do strange things. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We went to little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French villages</span> , you know where the bakers put their long breads in baskets outside the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I was a good runner, and I was a good thief. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I learned as I went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So I said to the guys, get me a few guys, good, the best runners we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">We nonchalantly walked through the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We grab a few breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They had these long breads, these French long breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I mean long, not the ones we've got here. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">About four or five feet long. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You grab a few breads and you run like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and then we shared and that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We went in, grabbed the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">By the time that they had a chance to even see anything, we...we were running like the dickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We were scared, hungry and scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">We were always hungry and scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We shared it. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Have you ever tried to go into a <span class="BUILDING">chicken house</span> and steal a few eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Don't ever try it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We went into a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We said to the guys...all we could speak was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We couldn't speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We couldn't speak no other language. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Nobody talks because if you speak German, the French hate the __, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">They're going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Nobody talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We get caught, nobody talks. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We went into the <span class="BUILDING">chicken house</span> to steal some eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">The chickens carried on. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">You would not believe the noise they made. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">The farmer came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Two farmers came out in fact, with pitch forks. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They found us. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They would have put those pitch forks right through us because food was always scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They didn't...they didn't appreciate anybody stealing their eggs or chickens for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I tell you we never run so fast in our lives over the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">After a few miles out there, we start eating some of the wine, the grapes that grow in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , but the farmers put a chemical on those grapes uh so the flies and things don't uh spoil them. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They gave us diarrhea. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We got sick from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">It was a bad situation, believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We finally made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neim</span> (ph), and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langlade two</span> at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The others stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Only two at a time traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langlade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">There was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French village</span> , and...a deserted <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Empty...just the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We saw a guard, one our people, one of the crowd, and they took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">They were...they already were better armed, better trained, smarter in 1n in the things they had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">After about a week or so we were surrounded...somebody must have gotten wind of it...by the gendarmes, the French gendarmes, and they asked us to give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Well, we knew we were in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and you remember well that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was occupied only half and the other one was Vichy controlled, Marshall and ; you know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So at least we knew we were in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">You always had to go south. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So we got together, said look, all the young guys, guys like, you know, fifteen, sixteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two...make a run for it over the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We're going to shoot out at the gendarmes on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and you run on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We keep them busy on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So we said what's going to happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">They said don't worry about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">We are older guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We expect it...we expected this anytime to happen, so it happen now. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Maybe we'll get away too. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But we'll fight it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We...we're going to give them a run for their money. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">In the meantime you make a run for it, all the young kids, make a run for it, because you're the ones that can run. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And believe me, we got good at running. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Sure enough, they started the firing and he says go and we went, and we run over the <span class="DLF">fields</span> while they keep the gendarmes busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And the French aren't | anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We found that out. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They they're not too bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">They're cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">They're barbaric, but they're not bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And where will you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">You're running through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Where will you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Naturally...Nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">That's the answer...Nice, toward the <span class="DLF">Italian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> is toward the <span class="DLF">Italian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I end up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and what the French did...they would close up a part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Suddenly three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with gendarmes would pull up and they would close up off part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and and and they would arrest anyone that they can catch that had no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">You had to show papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">You had to show passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You had to show money that you are not a vagrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">If you can't explain your existence, to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> you go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  Were you by yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  I was by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I didn't know these things that they did there. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And of course I was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So what they do...they put me into this . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There is a , you know, the _, a <span class="DLF">park</span> , an <span class="DLF">army park</span> , in in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and they had a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And they put me in this and took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">The others they put in other <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> that they caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">To...to me no papers, no money, no past, no present, no future. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I couldn't speak a word of French and I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I said what more can happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They put into into a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> by myself...one day, two days, three days, and the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was right...1t was a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and a little <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">The <span class="DLF">street</span> was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So I was watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I I I became observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I could <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="582">When they put me into that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , I kept walking slower, I kept sizing up the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I was looking around to see how many <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> there, see what...where the <span class="DLF">wall</span> is, see what's behind the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , uh see how the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> closes...I became very, very observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">One day the guard came around. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">He says, well, he says, one morning, tomorrow you're going to be handed over to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They're going to pick all you Jews up. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Well that night I counted the time the guard would make the rounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was about ten minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I counted...one, two, three, four, five minute passed...one minute, two minute, three minute, four minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">About ten minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">There was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> with a little <span class="DLF">trap door</span> where they put that thing in where you urinate in, and that was closed with a piece of wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They just place...put a piece of wire through it and wrap it around. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They say you couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I noticed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He left. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I went up, pulled that thing out and I worked the wire back and forth till 1t broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I worked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Every time they came by, I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">He went. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The moment he left I had the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I'm a little skinny thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">There were five more <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , and they had a bolt that you could open from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I opened all five <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and I looked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">It was a pathetic view. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">When I tell you it was pitiful...they were loaded with people that they caught here and there, that they arrested, waiting, so I said you know, you got eight minutes to go over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Eight minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Now it's seven minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Get the hell out. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Move. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Get over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I got them all out to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I said get out, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I want to talk to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They all came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I said come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">See that <span class="DLF">wall</span> ...make it...make a go for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Go, go. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">You had to...1f you have to die, die fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">At least try. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They looked at me and they said where are we going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Nobody wants us. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Nobody's going to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Where do you want us to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Well, I knew I only had a few minutes left and I said look, I don't know about you but I'm going over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I climbed...I went to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> which was no big deal, but they had this little piece of glass on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> like like like to cut yourself on, you know, was over every half an inch of glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I took what shoes I had on, if you could call it shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I went in between but I cut myself anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Outside the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was a lamp post and outside there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> going back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I looked right on top of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I waited until the walked the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I jumped onto the lamp post, went down and start walking immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I didn't even stay...I didn't give him a chance that he would...where this guy come. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I just...I never saw him...I just a minute ago...where'd he come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">He didn't say a word to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I nodded to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">He smiled at me and I kept on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">The moment I was a few hundred feet away, I started running like the dickens just to get away from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Two guys stopped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">One guy said to me if you're on the run, if you're a Jew and you're on the run, three blocks down 1s a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">They have three <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">You can collect your breath for a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Get something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">That's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">There must have been a hundred guys there, hiding in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And he said to me you can stay maybe two days, maybe three. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Then you have to make room for somebody else that needs a piece of bread or that needs to get a night's sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So somehow we started to get organized a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Somebody...you see, it was a big thing when...if you could get a night's sleep without having to worry or if you get a piece of bread without having to sleep with your with your stomach empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">That was a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Or or if somebody gave you piece of blanket and you got warm for a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">That was a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">You could let go of fear and of and of of nerves and of and and of being so frightened, and and this so cold all the time and so hungry all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">You could let go of it a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You could lay down, say ah...I just want to sleep a few hours without having to worry somebody putting a bayonet in my back or a gun to my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It lasted a few days and said look, I have to make <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I got caught again. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Got no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">This time they took me to a Ausglis Sur Mer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Well Ausglis...naturally in chains with dozens of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Ausglis Sur Mer. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They put us into, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was another <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> with barbed wire around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">They threw us in there with maybe uh twenty, thirty kids...all kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Ten, twelve, fourteen, eighteen, fifteen, thirteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Look __. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">There's two boys going to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">That's your life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Make the most of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Nobody really understood the significance of being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Somehow we didn't even...we couldn't comprehend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Only the fewest mentally could comprehend it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="678">Pause) Next day came...nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Night came...nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Day came...nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They threw in one bread like this was food was in for the day, and the others break a piece for this one and a piece for that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Threw some water in, and we waited and one morning they took us out and amongst another three, four hundred they put us onto a unto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle boat</span> that was docked nearby and uh the guard du mobile was on each <span class="NPIP">side</span> and we had to go through the <span class="DLF">line</span> , you know what I'm trying to say, through the <span class="DLF">line</span> between the guard du mobile, be...between the gendarmes, and as we went through all chained together, they would beat us and kick us and spit at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Some fell down and we had to drag them with us because they're chained together, to get onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It was pitiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">It was really pathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">We had never seen...we had never harmed these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We never saw these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Finally the captain of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> came out and he told them to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">He said as long as I'm the captain, as long as these people come on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , they are not going to be beaten anymore, not by you, not by anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They're under my jurisdiction now. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Now let these people go. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">He was a nice man, the captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We went into this <span class="DLF">hole</span> , and on the top they put some heavy machine gun onto the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">That was the only way you could get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We had no idea where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Some people, the older guys told us...they looked through the, you know, uh openings in the in the belly of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> there was little <span class="DLF">openings</span> that you could look through...say I see the coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Now if you see the coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , they're going to take us to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">The coast of <span class="REGION">Africa</span> is not far from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So they took us to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> ...not <span class="REGION">Africa</span> ...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They unloaded us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They were waiting for other transports to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We stayed in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> ... must have been maybe six, seven weeks, in solitary confinement. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">One was not allowed to talk to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Let me assure you, the only way we kept our sanity was we knocked on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and the other guy knocked back. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">That was the only outside contact we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> that you could hardly lay down your blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">We had to lay on stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We had very little water. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We had very little food, and there was just no way that we ever found out what was going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We lost...we lost uh uh track of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We didn't know what day of the week, what month we be...we just didn't any more uh uh mentally uh whether it was day or whether it was night or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It was dark in there with a little tiny <span class="DLF">window</span> where they pushed the stuff going and and a little pot to uh uh urinate in and and they didn't clean that out for about a month and uh that was just...there were times when you wished you just gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">You just...let them kill me...I don't...you didn't care anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">There was just so much you could absorb. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">There was just so much abuse and beatings and and and starvation and and thirst and cold and heat that you could ab...that you could take. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And this was just enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">You just...many times you thought I wished I don't get up tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">The hell with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I don't care anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You didn't give a damn any more, but finally one day they took us out and they put us...took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and put us into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> where they transported camels and donkeys, and they packed us in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">We had no idea where we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And they said well, you'll never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">By the time we get through with you, there won't be much left of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Nobody answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Nobody said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">There was nothing...there was nothing to be said. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Let's let's stop here and then we'll continue on the next tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Tape #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Can you continue your story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move and we traveled...we must have traveled about three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They packed us in like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Some people died standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They wouldn't let us out to use the bathroom facilities or anything like that for three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  Was this all men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  All men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">All different nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ...you name it...they were all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">This was the remnants of people that escaped the persecution of their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and and escaped through through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and and <span class="REGION">swamp land</span> and and <span class="DLF">borders</span> , and smuggled <span class="DLF">borders</span> who tried to save themselves uh uh and ended up being being uh in that...being caught and put in that predicament. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And uh once a day they threw one bread into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , and a few bottles of water and that was for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  Did people share?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We all kind of...you know, if you're so hungered and so thirsty that you that your tongue swells on, you know, when you're very, very thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I mean very thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Your tongue has a tendency to swell out and you choke on your own tongue. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It happened to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And when you see a drink of water, believe me, you go for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">When you see a piece of bread, you go for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Well, after about three days in that...it's about two hundred miles into the Sahara, through the <span class="DLF">desert</span> ...the <span class="DLF">desert</span> as well as <span class="REGION">swamp land</span> and nothings...I would call it a barren desert...so finally the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They had the Spahice (ph) watching us now. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">The Spahice 1s an elite Arab police force, called the Spahice. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They have sabers and they are on horseback and they are vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I mean vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were guarding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">When we were dragging ourselves, we saw a few miles down the <span class="DLF">road</span> we saw a few <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and barbed wire around it in the middle of nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">That was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Djelfa</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Little did we know...we dragged ourselves through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , all chained together. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Oh the the French are famous for chaining you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We were real dangerous people...half-dead, half-starved...I mean half- sick...all kinds of dangerous people...so we dragged ourselves and we dragged the ones that couldn't even walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">We dragged dead ones with us that were chained to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">They were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We had to drag them along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> , and we could hardly ourselves walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Djelfa</span> very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">They were beating us all the way down, with whips, with horse whips. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Uh on their horseback they had these long whips. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They were whipping us all the way down and if you fell down, they would beat you till you got up, and it hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">It really hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We got there into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we had to stand at attention for the camp commander to come to address us, so we stood there for hours till he finally showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">He showed up with his German Shepherd and uh he had somebody with him and they pulled out a great big steak and they gave it to the dog and we had to watch how the dog ate that great big steak, and then you heard a speech, and I will never forget if I were to get a thousand years old which will never happen but that'sjust __...he says...alright, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I am your camp commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">You all came here to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It's just a matter of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">If you do what you're told, you live a little longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">If not, you die sooner. (</span><span class="sentence" id="785">Cough) Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">He said but you all came here to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Sooner or later, you all die. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">None of you will come out alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">That is my job, to see to that, and I'm very good at my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Now get into the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So they unchained us. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">He had an adjutant with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Now the camp commander...let me explain this to you...he was a...the book will tell you that...the guy that wrote that book...he was a sadist and a drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And the adjutant...he had an adjutant with him, his right hand...he was also a sadist. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">They would put people up for no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So we didn't know how bad it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">We found out later that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Djelfa</span> was the the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...there were many other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , _, , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Djelfa</span> ...there were many other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Djelfa</span> was the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in all of <span class="REGION">Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">The only people that were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Djelfa</span> were the ones they rounded up in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and anywheres they could find them, the most dangerous people to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , the most dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">That's the ones they sent like a . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">That's the ones they sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Djelfa</span> , to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , to isolate them from the rest of the world and eventually kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">We went into the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and we waited, and the next day, the next day we had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Now they were trying to build a trans-Saharian (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They were trying to build a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> through the <span class="DLF">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">The location of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was at the foot of the Atlas (ph) Mountain. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">That means that at night, the nights were so cold that your teeth would chatter, and the days were so hot that you almost died from the heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">It must have been a hundred and forty degree heat in the day, a hundred and fifty, in the shade. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">There was no shade. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And during the night you were so cold that you couldn't sleep because you had...you had no control of your teeth that would...that that would...you know, uh uh make such noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We had nothing to cover us ourselves with except the rags that we wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">They gave us one bread a day for a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , and a cup of coffee in the morning which was black water and a half a liter of soup and a half a liter of soup at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">We were full of lice, bugs, and then you started dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">All your blood came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">There were vipers that would bite you... in one hour, you're dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">We were full of scorpions. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">You know, there are bad things in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And we were laying in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">There were forty, fifty people in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> made for eight and uh you had only lay on your side, and if one had to turn around, the whole <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> had to turn around, and uh turn around...if something...something bite you, there was nothing you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">You you couldn't do a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Even if it was a scorpion or a viper or a snake, there...then you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">That's it, and they were building that <span class="REGION">front area</span> into the <span class="DLF">desert</span> and you had to work on it ten hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We had to drag sand from two miles down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , uh down...two miles down the other <span class="DLF">road</span> to clear the <span class="DLF">dunes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And the Spahice would keep whipping you. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">You must have read about the Egyptians (ph) transferring the Jews in slavery. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">That was much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">It was the same thing...the beatings, the hunger, the thirst, the heat, the cold. (</span><span class="sentence" id="828">Pause) And the beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He would come in the morning and he would have a dozen people striped naked and and whip them in front of the rest of them just because he likes it and he would stand there smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">The slightest infraction of the rules...they would bury you in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> , just your head sticking out and the Arabs would urinate on you, and if you moved your head, they would open your skull. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">They had little tricks like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">The adjutant would come in and just pick anyone he wanted, tie them up and beat them up and whip them. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">At just...just at will...there was no intelligent reason for any of these things to happen, because people didn't do anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">If you made a fire, the fire...we had no firewood but we used alfa (ph)...that 1s a desert grass and that burned, so we used to always keep bushels of alfa that we could get a hold of and uh make a fire with it to make coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">How did we make coffee? </span><span class="sentence" id="836">We made coffee on dates...uh the the pits of dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">We would brown them...makes good coffee too. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">The pits of dates...brown them, then with salt we would uh uh _ and and then we put them in in in hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Makes good coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">The camp commander comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">He sees smoke, and the first thing you would hear, . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">That means take...you know, we used to eat out of of cans like what you have here, uh vegetable cans that you buy in a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> ...we had a can. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">That was our...the extent of our...so he would say get your can and get your things together, whatever you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">You go fifteen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">was a a fortress of the French Foreign Legion, the last outpost of the French Foreign Legion. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">There was no longer a French Foreign Legion there, but the camp commander lived there and the adjutant lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">They had their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">He kept his horse there and there was the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">To go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort</span> for fifteen days meant water and bread, fifteen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Seventy-five gram of bread a day and a cup of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They would tie your arms behind your back and hang you on your wrists, like this and they would hang you on your arms, oh for a night, a day, two days, till finally your arms would hang out of the sockets, and then they would come in, strip you down in the middle of the night, strip you naked and put the hose on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And I took the cold that was at night, we got more cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">The hose didn't do just an easy job on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">If we were lucky...if you were lucky, they didn't turn you around and smack the back of the rifle in in to the small of your back. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">That was...that was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">To hear you scream was music to their ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">That was classical music to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">We didn't give them that...no...we didn't do that favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Not a sound came out of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They were beating us and beating us and not a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We would go...get unconscious, but we would not scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">We became very hard by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">We became very bitter and very hard and and very unforgiving. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">We would not forgive ourselves...1f we would have put out a scream, we would not forgive ourselves for that, because it gave them satisfaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">We wouldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">After fifteen days...there wasn't much left of you to begin with...after fifteen days, they had to get people to drag you back in, because you could no longer walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">The next day, you had to go back, back to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  Did you have any communication with the other men while you were in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">We were maybe five, six, or seven on the hook, most of them unconscious from the beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Most of them didn't feel like talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Most of them gave up on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">THey didn't...there was...there was just no communication...what...what was there to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">What could anyone say? </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It hurts. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I'm in pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I'm hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I'm thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I'm tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I want to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I don't deserve this. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Why are you doing this? </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Where is the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Where is everybody? </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Where is God? _____ </span><span class="sentence" id="886">there was no God. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">There was no world. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">There was no Pope. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">There was no priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">There was nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And by that time, we came to the realization that we are on our own, not to look out for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">There was not no help coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">We were there and unless we kept ourselves alive, we're going to die there, just like he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So we made ourselves a promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">We won't do him that favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We'll survive, and we worked on the trans-Saharian and two years later a dune came...a wind came and the same <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dune</span> was over the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">The wind just put sand back on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">We went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We had these sacks we put the sand in and that wasn't good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">They gave the sack that was in the front and in the back...one sack to carry was not enough yet for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We had to get a double sack full of sand and sand is heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And when you drag yourself through the sand with your feet, when you have no...you're barefooted and the sand is hot and you sink in...1n to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> , it's hard to walk and you carry that weight which it just pushes you down and you have no strength left and you see, you look up and you see this Spahice from the horses looking at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">He's...he's just waiting for a reason to to beat on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">You'll move. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">You get your last bit of strength together and you'll move. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And you hope and look forward for the end of the day when you can go back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and just fall down on your face and get a drink of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Anyone who could no longer work, was at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">There were guys...people that just could no longer work, the older people that could no longer absorb that punishment...they just laid down. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">They would get no ration, no bread ration and no water ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">That was forbode. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">That was...you know...a strict rule...unless they get up and work, they could get no nourishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So what we had to do is from the piece of bread that we got, we broke up a little piece into...well, a bowl, whatever you had there, and we collected and we gave it to them...a few pieces, just from a few pieces from the little that we had and gave them a drink of water from mine, a drink of water from the other guy's, and we we made another cup full like from the little bit that we could afford to...you know, that we gave. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And our...I remember our hands would shake when when we gave that bit of water and we looked at their faces...how they would be looking at us...thank you, thank you, just wet my lips. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Then the order came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Anybody who can't get up, they're going to come around and cut their vein. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So they came around and with their knife...they couldn't get up anymore, and cut their vein and bled them to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And they were...they were looking and says we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We know what's happening. </span><span class="sentence"
