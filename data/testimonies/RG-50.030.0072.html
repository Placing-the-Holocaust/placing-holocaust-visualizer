<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Uh, can you tell me about any of your recollections uh from your childhood, before the war began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well, I know and that's not a recollection but I know when I was six weeks old my parents moved to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> , which is where we lived when the war broke out in 19...May 10th, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So I was only four when the war broke out and my recollections are being part of a - oh I have got some as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I uh remember being very very angry at my father, uh and I gather the story is sort of funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">When I was two, my uh father had decided that I was - oh I was one and a half - my father decided that it was time for me to sit on the pot by myself, and I was, I gather, pretty stubborn, and my mother used to hold me up and he decided I was old enough to sit by myself, and he, so he said, he told me to sit down and I refused, I gather. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Now I don't remember that, and according to the story, he pushed me down and I screamed bloody murder and he walked out - and these are all, this was all reported, and my mother cried and I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Well, what I do remember is that I was so angry at him that when he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on Fridays - he traveled - he uh was a representative for a clothing firm - I remember it and I must have been only two years old - hearing the key in the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I remember even sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and exactly what I sat, and as soon as I heard the key in the <span class="DLF">door</span> I would take my plate and I would walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and I would go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and eat with our uh our uh our maid, and I just refused I gather, I refused to talk to him for months and I I have a lot of you know respect for that little two-year old with such strong principles. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh and then I remember uh going with my mother to visit my aunt and uncle and my cousin was exactly my age in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Assen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And they owned a <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> there and I was spending a couple of weeks with them and getting to know her which 1s still a memory on my part because they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and of course never came back and coming back and and reconciling with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I I decided to forgive him after all that time and I talked to him about that and and he said, I said how did you cope with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">how did you cope with this two year old just refusing to talk to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He said, that was your choice and I respected your choice, and that's the kind of man that he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh, you know, I think he was later on very sorry he had done it but in those days that's that was appropriate discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I remember that I was, interestingly enough, I was my father's favorite. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was a very bright child. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh I was very eager to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I have a brother who 1s three years older than I am and my brother got into trouble early in the game uh in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , like he was accused of stealing some stealing some crayons when he was in first grade, so I must have been three. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And the teacher called my father and I remember uh, oh my father just being furious at my brother and giving him spanking and sort of feeling, my feeling very sorry for him, and sort of you know wondering how he could be quote, a bad boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh we lived in a in a we lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My grandparents lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh I don't remember my grandmother very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">She died in '39, but my mother is German and my father had, as soon as Hitler came to power as a matter of fact in 1933 or '34, my father got my mother's parents out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They lived with us in in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so uh it was my parents, my grandparents and then four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My youngest sister was, my younger sister was born in 1938 and then I had another sister born who was born in 1940 but she died in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And I remember her being born. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">She was born just before the war, in 1940, and she was born in January and thinking that that's my baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That was my little baby sister - uh like she was my birthday present, so I have had very warm memories of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We had a, I remember just feeling very safe in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It was a loving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It was a large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And it was a family that that cared deeply for each other uh and so you know, just just thinking back to the little two-year old who stood up stood up to her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I have a real sense that I was aa strong, competent little girl uh who knew what she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Another memory I have is we had pictures, family pictures taken, and we had good friends who were photograp...he was a photographer and so I remember just having to sit and pose and finally saying, no more of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I didn't want any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I just refused to participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So again, uh memories of a little girl who had a strong sense of self, and I think that's significant because that that really changed uh...
QUESTION:  Were there other Jews in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you lived in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The the photographer as a matter of fact uh, Alter was his name, were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="49"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I think uh before the war had about 110,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we lived in, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> , didn't, had over 200. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It didn't have a large Jewish community, but it had a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , an <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span> and my, as a matter of fact I remember my father and my my uh grandfather going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> uh and I remember on Friday night they had services, Friday night, and we had our dinner and the candles on Friday night and uh it was it was a pretty tight Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  And you family was a part of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Oh very much part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My parents were both raised in <span class="BUILDING">orthodox Jewish homes</span> , my mother in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my father in in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , but uh my father rebelled very early uh against orthodox Judaism so altho...although I'm not quite sure - we kept the kosh..., my parents kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> but I'm not sure whether it was mostly for their uh sake as 1t was for my grandfather's sake who was raised and had lived all his live in an orthodox family. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But definitely part, strong part of the Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Uh do you have any recollections of the beginning of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Uh I was four and the the the strongest recollection is when the Germans invaded because what happened was that we were told that they were going to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> and so all of us, and that was Jews, non-Jews, uh were told to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> and my brother was hospitalized - he had a middle ear infection - and my mother was frantic because we were all told to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My mother was absolutely frantic, was trying to get him into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they were told that they had to keep the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> empty for the wounded that were expected, so all of us, uh all of us including my baby sister and my aunt - at that point my aunt, my mother's only sister and her daughter also lived with us, so 1t was a hugh family. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My my grandfather who was oh 80 years, uh five small children - by that time my baby sister was born - five small children, uh the oldest of whom was seven, my parents, my aunt and her daughter, all had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We were, we had to walk - we walked about I would say between twenty and thirty kilometers along a <span class="DLF">road</span> uh trying to find <span class="DLF">farms</span> where we could stay and I remember being strafed --the bombs, the Germans would bomb us. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And uh there were seventy people killed just along that <span class="DLF">road</span> and I remember uh a woman still standing over her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> , protecting her baby who was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And every time the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> would come, my aunt, my mother's sister, would pull us aside and and she was particularly fond of me and she'd literally cover me with her body. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And then when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> left then we'd walk again, and I remember stopping at <span class="DLF">farms</span> and the <span class="DLF">farms</span> would be full and finally - I think 1t was about 28 kilometers - we had walked 28 kilometers - uh getting to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> where they had some <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we spent about five days there, sleeping in the hay, until the all-clear was sounded and then walking back - the having to walk back we were not strafed - I don't remember being strafed or bombed during that walk back. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh and half way through some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> came and so mothers with children were allowed to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and so we didn't we didn't have to walk all the way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And coming back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and founding, finding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> unscathed basically - so that was the first memory of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh then ...
QUESTION:  When you returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , was it already occupied by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">You see at that point the Germans - they they overrun, they overran <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in five days, so I mean the the Dutch put up a strong resistance but you know, they were not prepared to deal with the masses and then of course the Germans bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> as punishment for German, for Dutch resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And uh so we were immediately occupied by the Germans and nothing much happened immediately but then my memories of those early years are pretty vague because they they started rounding up Jews - oh first from the <span class="DLF">coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> 1s 50 kilometers north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and 50 kilometers southeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , and I gather they picked up Jews initially from the <span class="DLF">coastlines</span> , so to prevent them from fleeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">That's why I think there were so many Dutch were murd... were massacred - they they just had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They couldn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="76"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was immediately occupied and all <span class="DLF">exits</span> were basically uh closed and so you were trapped in, we were trapped in our own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And the first memories I have uh I have is of wearing a yellow, having to wear a yellow star and I was four, so I wasn't ready for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet, but uh I remember that because we wore a yellow star, we weren't allowed to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I remember we weren't allowed to have radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Uh and then we were told that when I was ready to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1942, well really it was 1941, uh we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore and so for a while there was a little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> that they had in a - I remember it was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of a of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> down town Breda, and going there and sitting in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> with who knows - twenty other Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And the children just disappearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I mean one after the other these children just disappeared until that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed and then my father tried to teach us at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I think that was in 1942 because Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And and then you know, getting strong messages that that something very bad was going to happen and it was scary and my parents being scared and just fear, fear enveloping the family pretty much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  When you mentioned the children disappearing from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , were were families at that point being deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That's when they started. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They started deporting the Dutch Jews, as I said they uh they started first deporting them from the <span class="DLF">coasts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They didn't - the reason we we survived 1s because they didn't get to us until 1942 uh so we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> until 19...until the fall of 1942 uh but had they come had they come to us earlier we would have we would have disappeared too. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Uh see I have a memory still and this this was how close that it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My aunt lived in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we did but in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of it, and they picked her up oh I think a couple of months before they came to us, and I can remember, I mean I have a clear memory of standing in our <span class="DLF">doorway</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in and waving goodbye to her and her daughter, and they were off to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish war camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That's what I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And they went with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> where they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and of course never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And that was the aunt who was very very close to me, my mother's only sister and her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So uh, so they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh where we would have gone too uh but - oh yeah, because we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> so we were just far enough from the <span class="DLF">border</span> that we were to be picked up later. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And uh it just, and these children you know, may have lived on the on the outlying areas of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> , the children, and then of course the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> closed because there were no children really left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  During this period of the of the occupation, uh how did your parents tell you how to behave when you left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Uh, to be very very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I mean we wore yellow stars and and the yellow...the way it worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> 1s that everybody had to have an ausweiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That was like a passport, and - including us children - and uh in order for us in order for one to have rationing cards you had to have an ausweiss, and Jews had a big J on their ausweiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And, of course, we had to wear the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So you could be stopped at any time and asked for your ausweiss, and if you if you didn't have your ausweiss with you or and you wore a yellow star, you were shot almost you were shot immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So what basically happened is we, they didn't let us uh - we were young anyway - but they didn't, they they became extremely protective of us and they didn't let us be out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And when we would go out, it was with my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My grandmother had died in '39 but my grandfather would take us for walks. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">As a matter of fact that's one of the reasons we were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It's just incredible, incredible uh circumstance. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">When I ...
QUESTION:  Shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Why don't you go ahead and talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We can go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The uh uh so that that - what happened was that life became totally family-oriented, that uh they first picked up the Jewish men and I - that's another extraordinary situation - that my my mother's father uh had been very very wealthy, and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zempelburg</span> | Pol: S_polno, or S_pdlno Krai_skie] in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And after the 1st World War, during the Ist World War, had contributed a lot of money to the German war effort, and after World War I when that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where he lived uh became Polish, and he opted to remain German and he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and he got a Cross of Merit from the German Kaiser. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh they picked up Dutch men first. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They took them, Jewish men first and they took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> and my father had sort of been excused a couple of times one because he was head of the Jewish Council, or he was not perhaps not head but he was a member of the Jewish Council, because he had five children, uh and so on, but he had to, he was to report and I can remember it - my mother just being in tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Well, the day before, the day before my father was to report, my mother, and she is an incredible woman really - she took that Cross of Merit to the Nazi commander of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and everybody said don't be ridiculous - it's not going to do you any good, and she said look at what my father did for you know the <span class="REGION">fatherland</span> , and he actually acc...he actually excused my father, thanks to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And again, that saved our lives because without my father we would not have been saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And the next week, it turned out that was about a week before the rest of the family was going to be called out - we disappeared within that week. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And the reason we survived is because a man who worked for <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> , uh and I don't know - this this is what I was told - I mean that's not a memory I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I remember walking with my with my grandfather of course, but what happened uh he would take us for walks and a man who worked for <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> knew what was knew what was happening to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">By 1942 by the way everybody knew what was happening to Jews, so the the idea that people didn't know and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> didn't know, and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> didn't know is garbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Because we knew and we had no radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And everybody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh and uh this man had seen us because he worked for <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He was familiar with what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He had seen my father take us four children for a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My baby sister was too little. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And he felt so sorry for us because he knew what was going to happen to us, that one day he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , he came to my father's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he basically said do you want to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My father said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He said well, why don't you do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My father said what can I do - I've got five small children and an elderly father-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And he said if I, if I promise to help you, will you try and get out, and within a week - and I remember a significant part of that - uh other friends, Dutch friends had given us names of people who were willing to take in Jewish children, and within a week we disappeared, and it turned out to be just in time, just before the whole family would have been deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because most Jews went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Uh and what he did is he gave us false passports so the false ausweiss, so as our name was in Dutch "Magnus," uh he gave us authentic passports--because he had access to the blanks--and with new names. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And our new name became "Wachness.” </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Of course, Magnus is spelled M - A - G- N - U-S. Wachness was spelled - it sounds the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So if we would make a mistake, it wouldn't be as noticeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But the spelling was totally different - it was W-A-C-H-N-E-S-S. And uh and I remember one day we were playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and my mother calling us in and saying, children, we want you all to pick a new name. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And we had, because Anita is not a common Dutch name - uh we had always pretended we had different names, and I still feel bad about this because my sister Ingrid, the young...one just below me, her her play name had been Leesha (ph), but that's the one I had coveted, and mine had been Lanie (ph) and so when we got to pick new names, I said I want to be Leesha, and I remember Ingrid saying that's my name and I said well I got to be first again. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You know, I was the older girl so I got to pick so that's how we picked the new name. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My brother's name was Norman. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He became Jan. I became Leesha. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">My sister Ingrid became Lenie (ph) and my other sister Helga became Hennie. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And so we got to pick new names and that's that seemed like a big lark to us and then we were called <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and in the meantime my parents had gotten names of people who were willing to take us - we were called <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and we were told that we were all going to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And that we were going to go to strange people, and uh my parents didn't know who they were, but that if we didn't go we would not...we would be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And that we were never ever to tell anybody that we were Jewish because that would mean that we would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And that we would have our new names, we would live with these people, and that the story that they made up was - it's still a peculiar story that we had, we were Dutch but we had lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Emden</span> , which is near...it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> near the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> , <span class="REGION">northwestern Germany</span> , and that when the war broke out we decided we wanted to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> - we didn't want to be, so we basically were refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my grandfather who's who's German, that he was Swiss - uh and uh and because we were refugees we couldn't live with our parents because my parents, our parents were looking for jobs someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And that's why we were, that's why we had to be you know with strange people. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">That was the story that we were to tell people who would ask us uh you know why we weren't living with our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Immediately after that my brother and I were taken away and taken to a family in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we lived in, and we stayed there for two weeks and uh was, they lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that - and again in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because it's so such a crowded <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , several families would live in the in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there were another family living on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The family on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> did not know that we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So for two weeks we could not move. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I remember we slept in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We could not talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We could not move. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We couldn't do anything because we were told that if they, the people downstairs would find out that we were upstairs we'd be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And we, I remember also that sometimes they would take us out twelve o'clock at night just to give us some fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So we'd we'd go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and that was that was a very hard time because in the mean...you know, we had no idea where our parents were. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I mean there 1s a six-year old and a nine-year old just taken away, totally, from parents, sisters, and everything else and and, and yet we knew - you know, there was no crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There was no whining. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">There was just obedience. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And then after two weeks we were taken by some other people to the middle of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we stayed for two years with a magnificent family called the Buchas (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilthoven</span> --uh, which is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , which is in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they ran a very progressive <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the "<span class="DLF">Werkplatz</span> (ph)," the "work place.” </span><span class="sentence" id="162">She was a daughter of the Cadbury family of the British chocolates Cadbury family. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And they were Quakers; and because they ran a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they took in other children who were not Jewish and so for them to have other children there was not as obvious as it would have been for you know for an ordinary family. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So that was a very safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Now we were told never ever ever to tell anybody we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That nobody knew and that we were never to let it be known, and so that was a horrendous burden on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">On me particularly and it's interesting that when my brother's much older, well three years older than I am, I think I was much more conscious of the whole situation than he was and uh and my earliest memory - I think when we we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilthoven</span> in in October - no in September of 1942, and again what surprises me in retrospect is that there was no questioning - it was 1t was real acceptance and real understanding of what was going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There was no question about the fact that if we were discovered we would be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I mean that, we lived with that throughout the war, and I also - you know, now when I think about the horror of it, 1t blows me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But I'm so grateful we were children because we accepted it - there was none of the the fear of the neurosis, or the neurosis or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">There was none of the pathology that that could have induced really uh because we just knew it was going to happen - that that was the way, you know, being very concrete still uh we just accepted that's the way it was and it was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Uh my father came to visit us in October; so after months, my father appeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And it turned out he and my mother and my grandfather had gone to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> , which is in the southeastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We tried to go places where nobody knew us. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">My two younger sisters came about a month later and uh they had gone with my parents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> but that was too dangerous, so they they leaved them with another teacher of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that my brother and I were. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And my baby sitter...sist...uh sister Rita went to which is in the western part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ; though she died of diphtheria in 1943, so I never never saw her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Uh but my father came in October; and I'll remember his visit and it was incredible to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And he told us that uh he told us that uh our birthdays have been changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">That my brother, whose birthday was November 10th, was his new birthday was January 3rd. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And my birthday, which is January 29th, was going to be January 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And we accepted all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You know, again, you didn't question - that was the way it was, because it turned out that those were the birthdays that were in our new ausweiss - our new ausweiss which didn't have a J on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Of course, no J's on our clothes, no no stars on our on our, no yellow stars on our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And uh one of the children of the family we stayed, the Bucha family, I remember saying to my brother, "Norman,"--I mean, "Jan, Jan, what's his name, Jan. You know, you have a birthday coming up pretty soon.” </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And I said, "Oh, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">His birthday's not until January 3rd. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We confused his birthday with a friend of his.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Now unlikely story, but perfect logic to a six-year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Uh and I I that's what I remember about me an extraordinary competence - that sounds sort of conceited but in in dealing with the situation and making up stories and it also gives me today such enormous respect for for children - I, they're capable of infinitely more you know than we ever give them credit for, so uh because I have these strong memories still of myself when I was when I was six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Then the next major trauma was Santa Claus. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Now Santa Claus comes on December 5 in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he is, he comes from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and it's a non-religious holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It's not like Christmas here. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">It's Santa Claus who comes with his black moire (ph) - his name is Peter from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> on his white steed with his miter and and his staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Uh Peter has a big uh bag on his back and if you've been a good kid then you get candy and if you've been a bad kid you get put in the bag and sent, taken back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , so ....(laughter) and I remember being in agony because you see I believed in Santa Claus and I was quite sure that Santa Claus didn't know that my name had changed, and I couldn't tell Betty Bucha that I really wasn't Leesha Wachness - that I really was Anita Magnus - because that would let her know that I was Jewish - I mean I didn't - of course they knew, but I didn't know that they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So I can remember being absolutely terrified of Santa Claus coming because the way Santa Claus is in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , he comes in and visits and he sits down and you know he says, well, you know, have you been a good girl and stuff like that, and uh I felt totally trapped - that's, talking about terror - I was in pure terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Uh and I'll never never forget when he came and already trying to make up stories about what I would say to him if, when he called me Anita. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I would tell him that he was making a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But he came in, and because I was the youngest of the family, uh he said well, Leesha, have you been a good girl, and my relief - thinking my God, he knows everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">You know, because I so firmly believed - it was, I'll never for...you know, I'll never forget that intense relief of not being betrayed, because even a Santa Claus could betray us. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So uh when my father left us, and I'm back-tracking a little bit - my father left us, my brother and I had to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> very early - I remember seven o'clock - uh we started to cry and that's probably the most intensive crying and I, in retrospect I think we we started with pre...pretend crying, and I'm not quite sure whether we did that because we really wanted to cry ..... [Phrase missing]...a loving, caring oh unbelievably wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">When she came upstairs, I was afraid we were going to be punished, but she she of course didn't punish us. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">She was very very nurturing and very loving and and seemed to understand why we were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But I learned early in the game during the war years uh I learned early that there was something very wrong with who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I mean that's probably one of the major lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I mean when you look at our lives I mean we were among the most fortunate of all Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because we were not, we were out in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We were like Dutch children except we didn't live with our parents, and sure we were 1n danger and it turned out that several times they were very very close to catching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I'll get in to that in a moment, but when you compare it to most, to most other kids who were, like Anne Frank who was hidden uh for years, you know, and they could not go out and we were infinitely more fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Uh we were out. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We were able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We, and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , very progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Uh we had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We could play, could breathe fresh air and yet we also knew that, and I knew very intensively uh intensely, that I could be betrayed anytime, and so I learned early in the game that I was not to draw any attention to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">That I could not, I had to be a very good girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I could not be naughty. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I could not do anything that would make anybody notice me. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And so I learned not to complain and I learned not to express any feelings and I learned not to be a bad girl and I learned not to ever disobey because anything - I didn't dare do anything that again would make people angry at me because if they were angry at me they might betray me. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So it it put this this vice around me, basically, and when I compare that to the little girl who snubbed her father you know I I am aware of what a dramatic impact that war had, uh and at and it was really the most the most poignant memory I have was oh in 1943 I think it was, uh we were riding on what's a [bock... (ph)] - it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> with a big sort of uh box in front of it and that's how they would transport vegetables and stuff like that - and somebody was riding it and my brother and I were sitting in it, on the edge and I was holding on and then I noticed my brother was not holding on and I of course being you know wanting to be just as brave as he, I decided not to hold on just at the worse possible time as he was going around the corner, and I fell off the [bock... (ph)], hit my head on the on the <span class="DLF">asphalt</span> , on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I'm sure I had a concussion, but I thought I'd done something very bad, and I had the most blinding headache that I can imagine and I I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I didn't say anything because I thought I'd done something very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I didn't say anything to Betty Bucha, but I was in such pain that I would just start crying and I'd just walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and would come back and then I would just be in so much pain again and I would just walk out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I remember I just was going in and out, just terrified of being noticed, so I never told her. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And another time I was running and I ran into a <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and I got a a big uh cut on my forehead. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">My terror was about being betrayed to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It wasn't about hurting. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It wasn't about, you know, having fallen. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It was that I had done something bad, and I was, this could meant the end of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I mean crazy associations. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But basically I learned that uh I, you know, I I was not to ever do anything that in anyway would make anybody mad at me or upset at me or or would draw attention to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Were there many Germans in the this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was located?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Oh there were Germans all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They were not, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> they were not as as obvious I mean you know that, during the war during the war itself because they they felt the Dutch were also Aryans so the Dutch except for the Jews were just fine and they really believed that the Dutch would eventually cooperate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And so for the first four years, except they did pick up a lot of Dutch men, they were quite quite lenient with the Dutch population itself and no <span class="NPIP">where</span> as vicious and brutal as they were for example with the with the Poles or with the uh with the Russians, particularly the Ukrainians because they were the untermenschen. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The Dutch were supposedly part of the great Aryan race - the the super race, and it was just the Jews who were you know the vermin, according to their uh philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So the Dutch, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> didn't really - no, that's not true - the underground of course suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I mean they, when you were caught helping Jews or if you were caught working underground but the but the but the actual occupation did not become very serious until 1944 when they finally convinced uh were convinced the Dutch were not going to join them in their uh lunacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  What what happened next in in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Well, we stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Uh and II did well and we stayed with this wonderful family for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We were again very fortunate - my two younger sisters were not as fortunate because they were shifted from one family to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But we stayed with the same family. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We moved several times but that's because the Germans the Germans uh took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I mean they, we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the Germans requisitioned that, and then we moved to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then we moved to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but that was because the Germans just you know, when they when they wanted <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> they just kicked people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But we just lived with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We would go and we visited our parents once during Christmas and uh there was there was uh and that was the first time that I had seen....I can't remember whether - that was not Christmas of '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I think we visited them Christmas of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Uh I can remember in '43 I saw my mother I think for the first time because my baby sister died, uh Rita died in and she came and told us that Rita had died and I remember just crying, being incredibly unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  So your mother came to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Yes, to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were staying, yeah, to tell us that Rita had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And then I just remember just being very sad and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But the the most amazing thing was that we just sort of accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You know, we never whined. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We never demanded. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We never we never did anything I think to betray our family or or even endanger our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">The the biggest danger to us came, well there were lots - it turned out there were lots of times when my parents were very close to being discovered - and the reason we survived is because the Dutch that, who encountered us didn't betray us. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It was just the unbelievable luck that all the Dutch who discovered our Jewishness were good were good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And that included the Dutch police. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And you know again most Jews were not that fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But the most dangerous time for us came in 1943 when uh my sister stayed with some teachers at that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and one of them was caught with some communist books, and when she was asked who else lived 1n that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , uh she said well, two little girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And they said immediately now that those are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I mean they they assumed that any children who who weren't, who didn't live with their parents were Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So that was the first time that we were going to go and visit our parents so we, the first time that I must have visited them was in the summer of '40...'43. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Uh and the Germans uh we were told were going to accompany us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they were going to interrogate us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and that would have been the end of us because there is no way that we were sophisticated enough to to make up enough of a story uh particularly my younger sisters wouldn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They, who are one and two years younger than I am, but German thoroughness of course demanded that they could look at these Jewish children and it so happened that my younger sister and I were standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Now uh I was quite, much lighter and I have blue eyes and you know, I don't, I'm not typically Jewish - I don't have a semit...I don't have Semitic features and my sister, my younger sister has blonde curly hair, blue eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I mean, and they looked at us and said, . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">You know, "They can't be Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So...because we didn't look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And that was one of the reasons, as a matter of fact, that we were saved is because the man who gave us, was his name, who gave us the false passports, said that he he had selected us to help because we did not have Semitic features. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I mean it's just a horrifying thought when you think about it, but it allowed us or the fact that we were not quote "typically" whatever typically Jewish is. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Of course we didn't look typically Jewish - uh that's how come we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And again we didn't fit the German stereotype of you know typical Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So again we were miraculously saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Uh I mean we miraculously not not trapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Uh my parents had, I gather, they told me they had razor blades ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They were not going to be caught alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They knew what was going to happen to them and they weren't uh...and they also, they would have killed themselves because they also knew if they were caught they would betray us and so again you know there were all all these very conscious decisions were made as to trying to have as many of us survive as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And we were able to visit them in in the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I spent I think a week with them and then we visited them again in the following Christmas and there we had an accident happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We were standing at a, they were they were sledding down a <span class="DLF">slope</span> , a <span class="DLF">snowy slope</span> , and mother and my sister and I were standing too close and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> ran over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">My mother had high boots on but I didn't and I got a deep wound which became severely infected and I got boils all over my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And that was on two of my legs and which which didn't heal for months until until the following spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Again lucky that I was strong enough, we survived - you know, there wasn't any penicillin and uh so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But basically in 19...for two years we lived as school children and we lived without our parents and we lived with fear and I can remember saying to one of the other girls, the daughter of the family, I said I have a very big secret but I can't tell you until the war is over. (</span><span class="sentence" id="286">Laughter) I, 1t was like, you know, I was like I knew the war one day would be over, so I must have a lot of hope uh and a lot a lot of optimism. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I guess I must have felt that we would live. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh and at the same time I remember my major mission was not to do anything that would betray us. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And my middle, my younger sisters would sometimes really do dumb things like well, dumb things, what do you expect of a - I was six, so they were four and five. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I remember Ingrid at one point, we were walking and she said oh she said oh Leesha - I was Leesha - Leesha, you know I met a I met a girl whose name was Ingrid and I told her that used to be my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I said don't ever say that (laughter) - I remember having to remind her that she was not to not to ever ever uh uh you know remind anyone or tell anybody that that Lanie wasn't her real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But what's remarkable is that we played we the game right on until the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh and again turned out that the only people knew we were Jewish was the family itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Their children didn't know we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And, but we made friends and we saw our parents every once in a while and uh again unbelievable fortune fell our way because uh at in 1944 my, when after the Normandy landing uh things became very tight and that's when the Germans became more vicious towards the Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We had gone with the family to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in and there was a lot of bombing, a lot of strafing, and the family told my parents they could no longer be responsible for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So that was, that was August of '44 and my mother came - my mother has always been very brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My father has said if 1t weren't for my mother and her courage we would never have survived the war, because she again and again and again, she would be the one who who said to my father, you know, it's going to work out and she would she would take on the police who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and questioned them and interrogated them, cause see from their perspective they were interrogated many times about who they were and what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Now they were out in the open too, but my father wasn't working and so their story was a more difficult one than ours, and so they had continual contact with [Pinkstrum (ph)], the one who gave us the false papers, and he again throughout the war continued to help us make up stories supporting my parents' stories and so on so that if we had had one NSB--which was the Nazi...which was the Nazi support group in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">If we had had one real Nazi supporter, we would never have made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But uh somehow, again, we...we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But in 1944, my mother came to get us. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">She got my brother and me; and my two younger sisters already were with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And incredibly, in September of 1944, we were liberated by the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Uh they came up, they had landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , and they came up through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and just through a tiny part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And they were supposed to meet up with the British at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They made a movie, "The <span class="DLF">bridge</span> ...", "A <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> Too Far.” </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And, of course, there was a German panzer division at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> ; and the British were defeated there.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So instead of liberating the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , they went into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Had we stayed in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> we would not have been liberated until May of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But we were liberated uh uh - as I said we we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And in September, I'll never forget that in September of 1944, lots of bombing, lots of explosions. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Was a Sunday and my mother came - we were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , and we slept, we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but my parents had rented the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> and a couple of <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> of a very nasty, ugly woman uh who turned out... She said, "If I had known you were Jews, you would never have lived.” </span><span class="sentence" id="314">horrible woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Her name was [Bilders (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Anyway, we, my, there was so much bombing that my parents, my mother came to get us and we were standing 1n the in the front living room, and my mother was combing my hair, and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> here - my mother was standing here and I was standing right there - and there was the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And a grenade exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And a big piece of the grenade flew right between my mother and me and scorched her nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And it bounced against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and it bounced back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and a pair of pajamas and the pajamas burst burst into flames, but again you know death was so close. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Uh it's it's just miraculous - a few inches either direction would have killed either my mother or me. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Uh so we got out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and we spent the day in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and we heard all the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">My mother again was very brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">She would go upstairs and I'm I'll never forget at four o'clock, it was about four o'clock and she would go upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">At four o'clock she screamed - she said the Americans are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I, if there's anything that stands out in my memory it's it's those words - the Americans, the Americans were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And the Americans coming up on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> - uh we lived sort of on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and the Amer...the Germans were retreating up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and they were shooting down at the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Of course we were dying to go upstairs, and uh see what was happening, uh and we were allowed to, after a while we were allowed to go up, and I cannot tell you what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I, it's a memory that you know will never cease in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">As, I think <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> has always had such a close <span class="NPIP">place</span> in my heart because it meant it meant life for us, and in all sorts of ways, and that was before we had any idea we would ever come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Uh but there were the American soldiers and they were being shot at by the Germans but it didn't seem to bother them very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They were ducking the bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And then after a few days when we were allowed to go - perhaps two days I think - we were not allowed to go out because there was so much shooting going on, but after a few days we were allowed to go out - one of the best sights I remember seeing was Germans with their ' This battle took place September 17-25, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">arms, you know, over their head and the feeling that they no longer present the threat to us and that we no longer were in danger was just a relief and an over-whelming sense that, you know, it's hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I mean talking about freedom and I was then eight years old and I'll never forget that immense relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">What was amazing was that uh in December of course we had the Battle of the Bulge, and at that point everybody knew we were Jewish - some, everybody knew - that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we lived in was uh , a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Of course then it was clear you know, we made it and let people know that we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Then we had the Battle of the Bulge, and that - I remember being terrified of that because if the Germans had won that, I knew that would be the end of us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So there was was some more fear then, but then when the Americans won, the Allies won, then I think we really felt that we had survived uh and just that we would live. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And then one of the hardest things was for my poor mother to get back to our original names. (</span><span class="sentence" id="340">Laughter)
QUESTION:  Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  Well, I mean all of a sudden instead of being Jan and Leesha and Lanie and Hennie, we had to...we were again Norman and Anita and Ingrid and Helga. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And I can remember her saying Leesha, , Lanie - oh, whatever your names are, you know, come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We uh we uh it was it was unbelievable to go back and be with our parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Uh and I can remember thinking I will never ever ever leave them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">It was just like, it was like having a whole new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Uh we had some very, some interesting times because we that's the first time that I saw black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Uh we were liberated by the American Army; and the blacks were separated, segre...segregated. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So they lived in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and the Ameri...and the whites were uh in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And I can remember asking my mother, "Why are they so black?," </span><span class="sentence" id="350">you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I couldn't understand that skin could be black, because we...the <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> didn't have any dark people. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And I, I remember saying to her, you know, "Why don't they use clorox? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Perhaps that would...’ (Laughter) Just didn't seem... it didn't...didn't make any sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And we were scared of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But then we were fascinated by them; and they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We would go and sort of talk to them, and they'd give us big chocolates. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And uh the Americans who...the American soldiers stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ; and I remember we would go down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">My parents had told us you never ask for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now the Dutch kids, you know, I mean that had had nothing for a long time... I mean, that's the first time we saw oranges, the first time we had candy--all of that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Food had been rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Food was mini...had the minimal. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So we'd go there; and we'd stand there and look at them with our big eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And, of course, the soldiers just loved us because we never asked for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We always ended up with the most. (</span><span class="sentence" id="365">Laughter) And my youngest sister, Helga, would pick up soldiers, which was fine because she was six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And one day she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a chaplain - said, "Mommy, that's the best I could find.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="367">Laughter) So we ...that was our first encounter with Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We met uh a Jewish soldier - a guy name from <span class="REGION">California</span> , who became a very good friend of ours, and uh it was almost like we had to get used to being out in the open again and regaining our own identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And it's only in retrospect that I now realize what a hugh price we paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Because you know when you're going through this as a child that's the way life is. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You don't really question it. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">You do what you have to do, and given those circumstances, children will follow the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">At least all of, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But uh right smack after the war you see, I mean not even after the war because the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> wasn't liberated, some very bad things started to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Uh the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> that we lived in was all Catholic - one hundred percent Catholic - and so as soon as it became known that we were Jewish, we got things like Christ killers, dirty Jews, uh - <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> which really had not known anti-Semitism before the war, the horror of of World War II is that it awakened in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I think an awful lot of anti-Semitism, a tremendous amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we started encountering that - I mean in retrospect it just blows me away to think that uh there was no debriefing. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Nobody ever ever talked to us about what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">There was no counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">There was no support. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It was as if we now were, we had to enter a new but it was a foreign society - it wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> the way we had known it because we became we became dirty Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Now not by officialdom necessarily, but the children uh I remember that soon after - because we hadn't gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you know in the meantime you can imagine what our schooling must have been like, uh very interrupted, very sporadic, and the first four years if I had, if I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> two years it was a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Uh by the time I was eight, let's see, nine - by the time I was nine I think I had been to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> about two years at the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">So my father taught me a lot at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again after not having been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for six months or so, and there was a birthday party and we were the only ones who were not invited to go to the birthday party, and my father took us on a big walk and he consoled us. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But it was just, see we had to come, we had been non-people, and then we remained outsiders. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Uh we stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh we that we left the family and went and stayed with a woman whose husband had been a a Nazi, and so he was imprisoned and she was forced to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Now she was scared of us - she thought that we would, I don't know what she thought we would do, but uh so we lived there you know for a couple of months, because we could not go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> because the Germans were still occupying so much of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And even though <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> was also liberated pretty soon after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> , uh it still wasn't safe to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So uh, we kept on going to - and all the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I mean, that that again talking about the intense necessity for free...you know, for separation of <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and state - uh I'll never forget the experience we had having to go, having no choice but to go to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span> , and and being called Christ killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Now that only intensified the feelings that the war had fostered in me - the feelings that there was something wrong with me and being a Jew was a bad thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Uh ashamed of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Uncomfortable being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Uh something that you wanted to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It wasn't OK to be who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">You were different and you know how bad it 1s for children to be different - I mean how hard it is for them to be . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It's bad for kids to be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It's hard for kids to be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Uh and so we felt that we never, we just never fitted in and as soon as we could we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> which was not until I think April of 1945, so for about four months we lived very tightly with our family but the best thing was that our family was back together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We have to stop now. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We have to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Can you tell me what happened when you returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We we finally were able to leave, I think we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> in April of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We were, all of you know the war ended in May of '45, May 5, 1945 in in Europe and we went back to - we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Of course what had happened is my parents had left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived in and my mo...my mother had had oh just her her dowry had been this gorgeous stuff and and of course everything was left behind and we came back with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">We stayed for about six weeks with a family where my aunt had stayed - the one who, my mother's sister, the one who was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We stayed there and then uh after six weeks the woman said to us, well you can't stay here any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So we moved into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had been bombed and the whole backside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> - there was no backside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that had <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It was a large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but you know it was uninhabitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It had no gas and electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">It had no water and uh again we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go so we moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We basically squatted into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with the one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And the the water just poured in and it just because it had no backside, uh just poured in. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So my father just made holes in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> so the water would run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He boarded up some of the other uh <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with uh planks so that we could at least sleep there. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And for a couple of weeks we would go to neighbors to get water and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was just, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to go and we had absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My father didn't have a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We didn't have any money, so he got a job with the British censorship in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so, so in 19... uh... 1940 ...I think, that was '45 I think - 1t was almost immediately after the war uh after we were liberated, he went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and worked for the British censorship there. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So my mother was left alone with four children and her aging grandfather-- her aging father, my grandfather, who lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Some friends uh had given him aroom. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And so we lived in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in this bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">In the meantime my mother was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">My brother could not adjust to the school system in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We...the closest <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to us was a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span> ; so instead of going to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , we went to a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And again being the outsider was so obvious because of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We did not belong in a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , and it was uncomfortable and it made us feel uh unwanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Now we did not encounter there any uh of the anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I mean nobody there called us Christ killers or any of that stuff but we were not accepted either. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Well, finally my - the only way you could get a habitable <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was by finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that people would move out of. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And then you had to present it to the Notes Commission, which is the housing need commission and then they would rule on whether you were eligible to move into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And several times my mother would find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we would never get it and it would, the situation got to be pretty desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Well, finally we found a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the Juliana (ph), and it was uh next to a little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the conservation company. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And we were, and the way that it went was that you had to uh tell the tell the commission where the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was and uh then they would decide. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But because they continually took, wouldn't let my mother move into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my mother said you know, I'm not going to tell you where it 1s unless you let me know that I can have it, and they would, she finally was promised that that they could have the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And we were assigned that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and just before we were supposed to move in, the head of that conservation company wanted that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it was right next to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And again we were, they told that, we were told we couldn't live in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">In the meantime you know we lived in an unhabitable, uninhabitable <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was, just made the situation terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">My mother was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">She was close to a nervous breakdown I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">She had been so strong during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">She was, she had crying spells and she was 1n agony over . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It's hard for me to fathom now really she survived as well as she did under the intense kind of suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I mean she came back and it was very clear to us that almost our whole family had been wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Her only sister and her...her daughter were wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">My father came from a family of seven brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Only he and his oldest brother survived; and my uncle's only son, Bert (ph), had been killed by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We had two cousins who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , but their parents and their...that was their sister, that was the girl that I visited before the war - the family I visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They were dragged out of and . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They died probably en route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and we, I don't know really what happened to . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So after the war you know, there we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And of the Dutch, the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> , I think a total of twenty survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Two young men survived the labor, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> - young, strong men. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And the Alters, the...the photographer - he was killed and she survived with her two daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But for the rest, just we were alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And so anyway so she, under those circumstances again, and then living 1n this this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and again being denied that denied that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> uh, what in effect we did is that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that that we had gone to became a very fashionable <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after the war and the Dutch princesses went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Juliana's daughters went there; and uh when again we were denied that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> my mother went to uh the friends who where my fath...where my grandfather was staying, and he had some, he knew some people who were higher-ups and basically they, he said to that commission, he said unless Mrs. Magnus, , gets that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , this is going to go straight up to the Queen, and these, the response was oh those damn Jews - they want so much again. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And I just, the anti- Semitism which really had been dormant I think, or had, I I just don't think <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was anti- Semitic before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">If it was anti-Semitic 1t was well-hidden, but the Germans - and that's one of the horrors for me - in some ways the Germans won the war, because they succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They made the Europe Judenrein; they made it Jew-free. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And there 1s uh, I still pick it up when I go to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">There is an awful lot of anti-Semitism in Europe and they awakened the viciousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So that you see, that's what we had to live with then after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And it was never overt - well, that's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It was overt. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I mean you know - those damned Jews - they want so much again basically was the response to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Uh but we did get the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I mean the threat of using, of going straight to the queen and of using some some influence there - in effect we were assigned that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so in December of '45, 1t was very tragic because my grandfather died of a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">My mother tried to get him in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They wouldn't take him to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And he died of a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So there was mother just with her father just dead and the horror of the war, moving... Uh, my brother had gone back to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that we had gone... He...he could not adjust to to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> , and he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilthoven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">He stayed with the Buchas. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So there were just the three girls and my mother; and we moved into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Julianalan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And uh I gather my father just sent us some money from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we also got some reparation. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We never got much but we got probably a couple of thousand dollars, which allowed us to buy some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> because of course everything had been stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But we had come back to some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And so my, slowly but surely my mother was able to to furnish the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and to to buy some of the necessities and get us some things and uh my father came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I think in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And sort of a resumed - my brother came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilthoven</span> and we resumed a normal, quote normal family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But even right there in , | remember one day in front of our <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> - dirty Christ killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I mean, there again; and it just made absolutely no sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Now I must stress that my my parents, my father went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> - uh we lived we lived close to aaa sort of a lower class wor...neighborhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Our our <span class="DLF">street</span> was very very nice and very middle, middle-class, but we lived next to a heavily Catholic uh lower class <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and uh my father went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and - because we knew we knew that which kids had done it - and they did reprimand those kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I need to stress that there was no official support for this, but again, these were messages that the children had gotten from somebody, from some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and some bo...some body and I don't know who gave them those messages. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But it just retnforced that whole sense of not OK-ness. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Of something being wrong you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Now there were no Jews left and there were just, as a matter of fact, only four of us plus the Alter children - I think we were the only Jewish children who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And we were, you know, strangers in our own <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I felt that. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">That, I don't know that my sisters felt 1t as much I did, but I think they did too. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I think all of us felt 1t very very strongly. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It was never the way it used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">It was it was, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ceased being in a way our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Uh now we went uh, after we moved we went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the [Nutschool (ph)], the <span class="BUILDING">nut school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And after that I went to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Uh, but my learning was inhibited. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">This may sound crazy - uh there was something in me and I think that's perhaps the little two-year old rebel still was operating because uh even though I had always been a very very bright child, I started progressively doing worse in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And there was something in me that that just wasn't coping well with with the Dutch school system. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">It just wasn't working. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">My youngest sister, Helga, developed a terrible thyroid condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">She...uh she got a hyper-thyroid--she had a throat like that, and her eyes were bulging from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">A very very bright little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">She just became practically non-functional. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Uh my middle sister, Ingrid, cried a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">My my brother Norman uh flunked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We all became non-functional. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And yet we had loving parents, lots of support. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I mean, my parents-- if it hadn't been for them, I... I cannot imagine what would have happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But miraculously, my parents, notwithstanding everything that they have gone through, provided us with love and support and caring and...and a feeling of belonging. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And if it hadn't...as I said if it hadn't been for them, I think we would all have gone down the <span class="DLF">drain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But there was no recognition on the part of anybody uh what the consequences were of...of our experiences, of the war experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It was never discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">It was never dealt with. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It was never acknowledged. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And so there we were, four children who basically weren't functioning very well at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I...I flunked the uh...I flunked uh my second year. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Now the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> 1s a <span class="BUILDING">college preparatory school</span> , and it is pretty select. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I mean, you learn...by the time you go to seventh grade, which is the first year of the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , then. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I think that the system has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But I started studying Latin and uh Algebra; and by the second year of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the eighth grade, I added Greek and uh Chemistry and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And by the time I was...before, just before coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I was studying English, German, French, Latin, Greek, physics, chemistry, math.... I mean, just this intense array of subjects; but I wasn't doing well. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">It was like I could not study. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I wasn't absorbing the material, and it was like my mind was blocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And I could never - you know, it's funny - it's only now all of a sudden while I'm talking to you I'm beginning to recognize why my mind was blocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Because my whole life was blocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Because we were non...we were non-people. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We could not be who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And we never told anybody we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">That was just not acknowledged. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Uh, I remember we had one Hanukkah party, I think in 1948; and it was just like sneaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It was at night - we, I think the whole Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> --what little was left of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Of course, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ...there, there was no no <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> anymore because there were no Jews left. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">But I think the few Jews that were left all went to the Hanukkah party; and I remember learning some songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And that was my first exposure to Judaism, was that one Hanukkah party. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I remember still some of the songs, and there was a and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">That that was about the only Jewish part of me that was even acknowledged. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">My parents, I think, must have gotten the same message: you don't acknowledge it, you don't deal with it, you don't recognize it, you don't... 1t wasn't discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">You go on with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And uh <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you know, being in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> as I even mentioned to you earlier, became like being in being in a <span class="REGION">foreign land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Uh I need to stress, though, that since we didn't mention Judaism, that didn't come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And I had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It wasn't that I was an outcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I mean, I had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Uh, I was invited to <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">You know, I was not...1t was not at all like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breda</span> , on the contrary, I made some very very dear friends and best friends who of course were non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Uh, so it wasn't that I was isolated and alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Nothing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">But emotionally and intellectually, I think, all of us were stunted. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Uh and my parents...in 1950, I think, my father changed jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I think he decided that just <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ...we'd had it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And he wrote to our friend, Henry Koster (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Now Henry Koster uh was a movie director here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ; and he...1t seemed that he met my father before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">In the 1920's, when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was suffering from this tremendous inflation before Hitler, my father was...had traveled in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for business, and that's how he met my mother also in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And he had helped Henry Koster several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I gather, financially; and they had stayed in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And Henry Koster was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the 1930's, and became very successful in the movie industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He directed German pictures; and uh it was, you know, made it in the movie industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And after the war, my father was able to contact him again, and he sent us care packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">As a matter of fact, a funny story - you know the Germans, you know the Dutch too, took everything we had but uh we were, I told you we were liberated by Americans and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> afterwards and those soldiers would send us big boxes full of clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">In a way, I'm sure they they robbed the Germans to send us those those clothes; because we had no clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And so, for a while, we were clothed in German clothing that they sent us. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We didn't...didn't go beyond that. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Uh but but when when Henry Koster found out that we had survived, he they sent us care packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So then aft... instead of being dressed in German clothes, we were dressed in American clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We got lots of packages from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with food and clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It was enormously helpful; because, of course, there was nothing to be had in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And uh and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was in very very bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They not only had been terribly terribly damaged uh but the economy was wrecked. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">In 1944, when the Germans finally recognized that the you know the Dutch were not going to join them in their Aryan lunacy, uh uh they starved the Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And about a hundred thousand Dutch died during the starvation [winter (ph)] of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Again, that was when we were in the <span class="REGION">southern part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Incredible when you think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And uh although there was hunger there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I mean, there was no food there either; but nothing like the suffering that the Amsterdamers and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdamers</span> experienced at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So anyway, we were...we were... he contacted Henry Koster. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And Henry...in those days you had to have sponsorship; and he decided...he agreed to sponsor us and became our sponsor. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And our number...our number came up in 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Uh, our opportunity came to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ; and we we we left <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had ceased being uh our <span class="REGION">land</span> , our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And uh we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ; which was the best thing that could ever have happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">There's no no question about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It it freed every single one of us, in in the most intense way. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Uh my little sister Helga...the Dutch had no idea, the Dutch doctors; she was sent from one doctor to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And she was...she was just in terrible problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Terrible, terrible problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Because she couldn't learn, she couldn't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">She had a violent temper. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">She was just unmanageable. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Uh, my parents moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> ; and in... We arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> December 7th, 194...1952; and in June of 1953, a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> --a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> --they operated on her for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And they took out, thank God, a benign huge tumor out of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And uh she just blossomed. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Right now, she is uh a nurse advisor for the International Council of Nurses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I mean, she has an incredible job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ; and has just accomplished enormous things. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Uh the same with...I, uh interestingly enough... Uh, we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ; and our Henry Koster happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when we arrived - he knew we were arriving - and he greeted greeted us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">He was at...at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Uh, and we didn't know he was going to be there, but I I recognized him from his pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I remember going up to him and saying, "Hey, are you Henry Koster?" </span><span class="sentence" id="610">He said, "Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I mean, like it was just again one of these intuitive things. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Anyway, he asked one of us to come to be like a baby-sitter for him and his...uh for his children; not for him, for his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He had a nine year old and a six year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So because I was the oldest of the girls... uh I went with my parents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , and after we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , and my parents...we had...my mother had some distant cousins in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I, I think six days later, took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> by myself at age 16 in December all the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You know, we had no idea about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I mean, I'm not sure I'd let a 16 year old go by herself now. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But what did we know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  Did anything happen on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">People were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Although a very funny thing is, we came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque--</span> where I now live--we came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> , and it was absolute desolate and barren and it was December. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And I said to myself, "That's the last <span class="NPIP">place</span> I'll ever live!" </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And that's where I've ended up. (</span><span class="sentence" id="625">Laughter) Turned out to be very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But I went to... went and I moved--of all the insane <span class="NPIP">places</span> --to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beverly Hills</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And I... they lived in this gorgeous <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on <span class="DLF">Whittier Drive</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North Beverly Hills</span> ; and they had a butler and a maid, and--good heavens!--a three car garage and a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Unbelievable luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">You know, no greater contrast than uh <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> --which was barely beginning to recover from the war for the Marshall plan was just beginning to take effect--and going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beverly Hills</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> --which has got to be one of the extremes of American affluence. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Uh it was a devastating time for me; and that sounds terrible, but I had just, you know - the only thing I had going for me was my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">There was no self there. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">There was very little self left after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And again, from that little girl who was able to dare to stand up to her father, I pretty much had learned that it was my job to be a good little girl and to please and to take care of others and not to...not to pay any attention to my needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And basically the worst of it was I I had learned not even to know what my needs were. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">My job was to please others. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">My job was to go along. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">My job was to be invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">My job was to not cause any trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And again, I need to stress that's not what my parents told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">On the contrary. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">If anybody gave me support, it was my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But that's what I'd learned, and that's something I...my parents were not able to undo for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I mean, again, since the war was never discussed and these issues were never dealt with, all of that was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And all I knew about myself was that I was whoever I was, which was Jewish, was not OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It was something to be ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It was something to be hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It was something not to talk about, and that I had no basic rights either. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So this girl goes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beverly Hills</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> --of all ridiculous <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And I don't mean to be ridiculous, but you know what I'm talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And I enter this, and I'm fully aware that most of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beverly Hills</span> is not the movie industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Uh on the contrary. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But I happened to enter the the movie...the movie uh life; and that's an artificial, superficial in those days uh environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I mean, even naive as I was and ignorant as I was, I knew those people weren't real at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">As a matter of fact, I think the only real man I met was Marlon Brando. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And I met a whole bunch of movie stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I remember the one that I really felt good about was Marlon Brando, 'cause he was...he...he... I broke my leg; and he came to visit me, while he was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">That...that's when Henry Koster was making the movie named "Desirée", and Jean...Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando and a whole bunch of others came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And he came up to see me; and I remember thinking, "Now, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He...at least, he seems to be somebody that seems authentic.” </span><span class="sentence" id="660">But for the rest, I entered an environment that was was fake and artificial; and I did not know about that, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Because I thought that was real, and again I thought there was something with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Uh so I gained fifty pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">The only...the only the only uh the only pleasure I had was eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And within about six months, I gained fifty pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And ended up, you know, a hundred and seventy-five pounds fatso. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Which, in a way, was perfect; because the meant that my nothingness now was really real. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Because who wanted a 175-pound, you know, "blimp" uh 1n this...in this environment that so prized beauty and exterior and facade? </span><span class="sentence" id="668">It was...1n a way, it was just right; because it meant that I could hide behind that. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And this feeling of nothingness and of being worthless was, sadly enough, uh reinforced by my being in in...1n <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Uh, one of the most poignant for me uh circumstances was that I was very lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I...I went to Beverly Hills High School, and again they were very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I am in no way blaming the kids, because 1n retrospect I did not encounter any unkind children...kids at Beverly Hills High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I...I'm amazed at how how how kind they were; but I was an outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I didn't belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And they all lived at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And they, of course, had all these material things; which didn't matter, but I didn't have my parents and I didn't belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And uh within about a month, I was so desperately unhappy that I remember just thinking, "God, I wish something would happen to me so I wouldn't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So I wouldn't be so alone, and so...again, so much of an outsider.” </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And yet, the most insane thing was, when I went to Beverly Hills High School, I was all of a sudden--you know, because it's so heavily Jewish--all of a sudden, I was there with fellow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Except I didn't belong with them either. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I didn't fit in with them, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I didn't fit in anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So, I uh kept on hoping something would happen so I wouldn't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so I wouldn't be so lonely and so miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And I broke my leg, and I was so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I played...I broke my leg playing hockey... hockey; and instead of worrying about pain, I just was so grateful that I didn't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And that's when I met Marlon Brando. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He happened to come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But...and that's also when I gained all that weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">That was a good way of hiding myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I mean, I was desperately unhappy, desperately lonely; and uh something that reinforced my worthlessness--my sense of worthlessness, I should say--was I... I was promised that I would go... The first thing, the first big outing that we would have, 1s that Henry Koster uh had directed--I think it was "The Robe.” </span><span class="sentence" id="691">It wasn't "Desirée.” </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I don't know, it was one movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And and uh he told me I could go to the premiere. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And I was looking forward to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I thought that was just going to be the greatest. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Well, two days before the movie--before the premiere of the movie--uh uh Peter got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The little, the youngest one got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And I was told I had to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And for the only time that I can remember, I went to Peggy, Henry's wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I said, I...1 quote, I complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I said, "Peggy, you know I have really been looking forward to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Is there anything we can do? </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Can we find anybody else to take care of Peter? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Uh, you know, I would really like to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I think that's the most that I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Well, I was told that there was no choice; there was nobody else to take care of Peter, and I had to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with Peter. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And two days later, I was called on the carpet by Henry Koster--who told me that it was my job to take care of Peter, and I was not to make Peggy unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">That I had made her very unhappy with my complaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And that absolutely devastated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Just...1t confirmed everything that I had subconsciously believed about myself, that I had absolutely no rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">That who I was, what I needed, what I felt, what I wanted, was absolutely unimportant. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And that I was...I was a non-person. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And because I'm the kind of person that I am, uh I accepted that about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I didn't fight it. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I just became a worthless person. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And this may sound crazy, because right now I'm the exact opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And and what I recognize, I've come...I'm like the topsy-turvy dolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I, I'm one of those who you can push me down, but I won't stay down forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I...I'm back to that little two-year old who stood up to her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Uh, but 1t devastated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I graduated from Beverly Hills High School; and immediately went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , went back to my parents and went to <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">After <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> , I got my... Never made friends, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Never dated. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Uh, and the only thing I had going for me was that and so the the rector of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> sent a letter to the uh to to Beverly Hills High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">It said, "What she may be lacking in intelligence, she'll make up through industriousness.” </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I mean, those were the exact words. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And I remember thinking, even then, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">They've got me all wrong.” </span><span class="sentence" id="731">One thing - I've never been stupid, but I've also never been particularly industrious. (</span><span class="sentence" id="732">Laughter) And I knew intuitively they...they knew nothing about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">But that's typical, isn't it. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I'd hidden myself so well that nobody knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Uh and I kept myself hidden, because I was a non-person, throughout...throughout my <span class="BUILDING">college</span> years. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Although I became very active in organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I mean, I was always such a good girl - I helped and I was active. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And academically I just did better and better and better and better. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I mean, that was the one <span class="REGION">area</span> where I allowed myself to be unblocked; because I figured that's the only thing I had going for me was my intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And the other thing I had going for me--and I can remember saying that to me-- "OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Even if nobody loves me, at least my parents love me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I'm so aware [that] if 1t hadn't been for their love for me, if I hadn't been so sure of their love for me, I wouldn't have made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And I often wonder how people make it who don't...who don't have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Uh, and I... I mean, I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> a Phi Beta Kappa, got a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , got a Masters in Russian studies from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> --but still as a non- person. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">That's a crazy thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Still a non-person. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Still somebody who...who was not in touch with any of her needs, her wants, her feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I didn't date. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Had a hard time making friends, even though every... You know, people liked me because I'm such a nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But there was...there was a non-person. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And I started working for the Rand Corporation, after my Masters, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Monica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I went back to <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">My parents, in the meantime, moved to <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And I went back to <span class="REGION">California</span> , and I worked for the Rand Corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And I remember my boss saying to me...he said, "Anita, you're the most non-aggressive person I have ever met.” </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I mean, if you...if the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was blue, and if you said to me, "Gee, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> looks sort of grey.” </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I said, "Yeah, you're right. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The <span class="DLF">sky</span> 1s grey.” </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I didn't dare disagree with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I didn't dare argue with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I was afraid that if I would, you know, uh oppose something you would say that you would stop liking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Uh or you would not, you know, you would disapprove of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I was just...it's unbelievable in retrospect how trapped I was in my non-entity. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Uh, and interesting that Becky--Betty Bucha, uh the the woman who who with whom we stayed during the war, came to visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And she...she knew that I had changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I mean, even from the time she knew that that uh I had become a very different person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  When did she visit you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  She visited us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , so... While I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , so in the 19...I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> in '58, so...so 1956, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So about ten years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So I was...I was about nineteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And she she told me that I had changed, even from the little girl that she had known. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Uh, and and and now in retrospect it was all cumulative. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was all cumulative, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">From being this this very strong little competent girl to becoming a...just a nothing, nothing person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You were, you were telling us about your working at the Rand Corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">What...what happened to you after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Well, that's the wonderful thing, when things started to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Uh, I went to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> as a guide in the American Exhibit. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> , uh the director of that exhibit was a man named John Dixon. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And I met his, his ...he had taken his wife and his children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And, mind you, we had been in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And Elizabeth and I became very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">She was there with her two chil....two small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I sort of latched on to her, and she was the very first person in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> --and this may just in retrospect seem so strange...uh, this was 1960...1962--that I felt really valued me. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">She liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I can remember my very conscious thoughts; thinking, "Well, if Elizabeth likes me, and I value her, there's got to be some value to me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Because I truly believed there was no value to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And so it was a very conscious process, and I was I was very dependent on her friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Uh when I went back to <span class="REGION">California</span> , because I worked for Rand in <span class="REGION">California</span> , I was able to get transferred to to the Rand Corporation here in uh in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, DC</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And my friendship with her was incredibly important to me, because it was the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">As I said, the first time in ten years, since coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that I felt valued by anybody outside of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Even though my teachers had, you know, my my professors at <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> had been wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They valued me. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">But this was the first time I felt that somebody valued me as a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And that was sort of the beginning of my recovery. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I mean, I never had psychological help or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I, I--in retrospect, had I known then what I know now, I probably should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I probably should have gotten help. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">But what did I know? </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Uh, but that was the beginning sort of my recovery; in which I began to to appreciate the fact that I was a person after all, and I had...I had some value, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">But it's taken me years to get to the point where I am now. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Where, I mean, I know I am a person of value. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">You don't have to tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And and crazy enough, it's taken me years to be comfortable with being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I am still...[ am still not totally comfortable with being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I'm almost... I'm ashamed of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I'm...I'm comfortable with... I remember at <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> , because it had a strong Jewish population, feeling embarrassed if any of the Jewish kids were loud or obnoxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">My immediate reaction was, "Don't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Don't draw attention to yourself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Not wanting to associate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Not wanting to be known as one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">So that fear of association 1s overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Overwhelming that if they draw attention to themselves, and they found out, you know, they'd be identi...they're identified as Jews, that that may be the end of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And that'll be the end of me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Uh, I can remember going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> ; and being so pleased, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> has a huge Jewish population, but I did not pick up that--uh this sounds terrible on my part, but there is uh, you know, what what will be...what might be stereotypically interpreted as as some loudness and some obnoxiousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Which just - I didn't notice it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="820"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> was a more sophisticated situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I had never noticed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beverly Hills</span> , either, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">But it was...I felt that 1t was present at <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> ; so at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> I was more comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I fitted in a little bit better. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But there, that whole - I'm so aware of that whole fear still that if Jews do something bad, it's going to be the end of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">That if...and if I'm identified as a Jew, then I'm going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And if Jews do something negative, then I'm going to be bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And that, you know, I'm 53 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I still am not at peace with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I'm still not comfortable with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And that's sort of scary, isn't it? </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Because you know rationally, intellectually, I know this has nothing to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I mean, we had a terrible thing happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We had a Jewish man who killed...he killed two... He went into a <span class="BUILDING">bagel shop</span> , and he killed the the owner and his son-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">He was just crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And then he went to <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I don't know whether you've read about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">He went to <span class="REGION">California</span> , and he killed one of the guards at the Warner...at uh the <span class="BUILDING">Universal Studios</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I mean, this was an insane man; and he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">My immediate reaction was, "Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">What is that going to mean?" </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Not only the horror of the poor people who were his victims, but are they going to make an issue out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Is this going to give rise to anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Uh, you know, what is that going to mean to the rest of us? </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I still have that fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And I know it's irrational, because nobody made anything out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">It was never ever an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> , not in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But it was an issue with the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">When some ministers, uh--they later recanted; but basically said, "Well, don't...you know, you're the cause of anti-Semitism.” </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Because some Jews--I gather uh it was the the head of the <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> in which the movie was made--and they there that anti-Semitis..anti-Semitism did raise its ugly head. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">But I'm still aware of those, that fear of association and fear that that association 1s going to bring disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And the other thing that I'm also aware of, and that's still something that's staying with me, is I don't take anything for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Uh, when our son--we have a seventeen year old--uh when he was little, I wanted to make absolutely sure that nobody would ever do him any harm. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I...I guess I still don't really trust the outside world not to not to harm the innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And so I like to think I'm not too over-protective a mother or so - he might argue with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">But I would not play, let him play out alone by himself when he was little. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Uh he's always gone to <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> , so I never had to worry about him walking on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I couldn't, I don't think I could have stood the thought of my little boy potentially being accosted or or hurt by by any outsiders or being hurt by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , so there is an intense feeling of my wanting to protect him from any harm that might come his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Not so much - I mean he could climb <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and he could do all sorts of wonderful things and my husband is magnificent and he he just has encouraged him to do all sorts of wild things, so it's not that he's a protected, smothered little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">On the contrary, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">But I know that in my own behavior I wanted to make sure that no outsider could ever hurt him - that I never wanted to be in a position where I could, where I would could ever have done something that might have uh prevented harm coming to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And that immense relief that I have, feel, now that he's seventeen - he's taking karate and he's you know, gorgeous kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Uh but I feel in in in knowing that he can take care of himself the intense - that that strong feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And it's interesting because my cousin, her daughter was born in 1942 and she was, she was shifted around to thirty different families and her parents were in hiding when she was born, and this little baby was just shifted to - they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Uh, and she 1s, she's 46 or something like that - she's younger, about six years younger than I am, and she and I have exactly the same reactions as we don't, we we saw each other last uh September - we don't take anything for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">We don't believe that everything is just going to turn out OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We feel strongly that we need to do whatever it takes to make sure things do work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Uh when after I I when after I married in '69 uh my husband uh when he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> late or it was or not appear when I had expected him, I would just be terrified that something had happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Irrationally. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Just not really believing that I could be this lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Not really believing that my life could be so rich and so full, that I could be so lucky to have a wonderful husband and then this incredible child that we do have and we have, you know, we have a wonderful kid uh who's just just everything I could possibly hope for in a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And and and it's still hard for me to believe that I should be so lucky as to have all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  How did you come to move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  Well, my husband - I uh, after I met Elizabeth and after I began to sort of establish a sense of self - let's see, I was 26 years old - uh I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> I was with the Rand Corporation here, and then I worked for the Xerox Education Division, and I went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> uh in 1965 as a guide in the American exhibit, and I just started to blossom. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I mean it was just like life just - I really took hold of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And I started to date, and I started to enjoy life and I started to make lots of friends - I mean it's just my life just turned around slowly but surely. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And uh I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I I worked for Xerox in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and then got - I didn't like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at all - moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, DC</span> and my last job was as associate director of the Clearing House on Higher Education. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I started the <span class="BUILDING">clearinghouse</span> here as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And didn't have a director, so I got to do a lot of traveling, and I met my husband uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> , on a trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Uh he had just - he's a psychiatrist and he had just started uh work at the uh <span class="BUILDING">Medical School</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UMN</span> uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> , and he and I met and uh I was 32 years old and I had just decided I probably was never going to get married, and that was OK because I was having a wonderful time (laughter) and so I met him and within a very short time we decided to get married, and so I sort of gave up my job and my friends and everything and I really had a wonderful life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Loved it out here. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Gave all that up to go to that that one <span class="NPIP">place</span> I said I would never go to which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> , <span class="REGION">New Mexico</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And uh I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Of course there wasn't much I could do there with uh my Master's in Russian studies, so I figured if you can't fight them you join them and I decided to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I got a Ph.D. in, with a focus on child development/family relationship and I have - we've been there for the last 21 years uh and I teach at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> part-time and and I do some counseling part-time and it's amazing because my whole focus on family relationships/child development has made me so aware of the horrendous impact of the war years and all the things that ideally should have happened after the war that didn't happen, how much pain could have been prevented if people had been more aware of the horrendous impact of - even the, let me compare...our experiences are nothing compared to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They're nothing compared to the experiences of an Anne Frank living in in hiding for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I I, we've got to be among the most fortunate Jewish survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Uh there's no question in my mind and even with that unbelievable fortune uh the damage that was done and then the - and this may sound so corny but the unbelievable blessing of coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , which for every single one of us has been a God-send. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">As you know, I mean we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we were truly freed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And even though I went through a difficult time, that was not <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 's fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">That was just a you know continuation of of bad patterns but it was - <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> freed us up and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> helped us prosper. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Not financi...not just financially because we're all doing just fine, but emotionally and spiritually and in every every way possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Uh I just, you know, I just I still cannot believe our our our our unbelievable fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Then I met a man which is really interesting, because Alan, uh although we have our differences because we're very different people, but he was just the ideal person for me because he let me know from the very beginning that uh I was going to be responsible for my own life, and he's a psychiatrist, and he wasn't about to quote "take care" of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He wasn't about to uh you know quote "make me happy" or be responsible for my well-being. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">What I mean by that is he let me know that I was in charge of me, and that was the best thing he could have done for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">He never he never enabled me, he never uh fed into my feeling sorry for myself or my feeling inadequate or my feeling ineffective or my feeling not valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">On the contrary, he he just uh you know unlike many men he never expected me to serve him. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">He never expected me to cater to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">He respected me and he expected me to respect myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Now sometimes he's a little bit too tough with that, but but the basic message was and I remember early in the game, I I knew that either we would get divorced because uh you know he didn't play my game the way I thought most men do. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I mean a good example is oh soon after we were married uh oh I was unhappy about something he had done - I don't remember - and I was crying and I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he woke up and he said what's the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I said, na, you don't love me, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">He said I'mtired, _, I'm going to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And I walked out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> at the other end of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I waited for him to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And I was furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">What do I do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="909">He's not following my game plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And I thought well, you know, he didn't know what I expected him to do, and so I thought OK - I'm going to you know I'm going to pull one on him, so I got a cup of coffee and I served him a cup of coffee, which surprised him, because I wasn't following the rules, and I asked him, I said after we had talked, I said why didn't you come after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">He said look, you made the decision the decision to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I respect your decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I assumed you didn't want to be with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I wasn't going to impose my personality on you by being on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I said well didn't you know that I wanted you to come after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">He said no, I knew none of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">The only thing I knew was that you left the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">You wanted to be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">One of the most valuable lessons I learned in our marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">It meant don't play games with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And I learned - you see that's where self-respect comes in, is you you act honestly and you're straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">You're real. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">You're open. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And you're, you're honest.</span></p>
