<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Laura Margolis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And would you tell us where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , in 1903.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Would you tell us something about your family and your early life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> -Hungarian grand...grandparents and parents really. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And...uh...my grandfather was Dr. Schwartz who...uh...was head of the ____ Jewish community in...uh... <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and also consultant to the...uh...Sultan of ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My father, on the other hand, was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I'll get to the marriage part and how they met which is also history...uh...and as graduated high school. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">But because of the anti-Semitic regulations there, he couldn't go on to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , so he decided to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and see if there wasn't something there that he could do, and he spent a little bit of time in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and...uh...decided that the thing for him to do was go to back to his father, get some money, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and study agronomy, and eventually settle in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Now in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where he studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , his professor of Botany was Dr. Otto Warberg, and...uh...there was a very close warm friendships between student and professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They somehow clicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Parallel with this period, my grandfather, Dr. Saloman Schwartz, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> had...uh...wanted some of his own medicines patented in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and was also in contact with...uh... Professor Otto Warberg for patenting his own medicines. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">This was all 19th century almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And...uh...when my father graduated, his destination would have been <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> straight, but Dr. Otto Warberg suggested to him that he first go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> and meet Dr. Schwartz and maybe he would put off his going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for a few years because Dr. Otto...Professor Warberg's idea was that there was land up in Asia-Minor and...uh...that with my father's training, he would...and with Dr. Warberg's money, he would be able to do some settling of Jews who were already running from the Soviet...from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , not the Soviet Union then...from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> , and were becoming beggars on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and he was already in those years thinking of making them farmers eventually to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">This was before EXKA_ which was established in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and EKA was a philantrophic Jewish organization that was settling Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And Dr....or Professor Warberg really wanted to do an experiment with his own money up in Asia-Minor. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So my father agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">There was no reason why he couldn't do this, and he adored his professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> to Dr. Schwartz who had all the contacts with the Turks and my mother opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and that's where the romance started. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Now, they went together up to <span class="REGION">Asia- Minor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That's where they spent their honeymoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And it was...uh...absolutely wild up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And...uh...they did...were able to bring some of the Jews who were just hanging around and becoming beggars in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They were prepared to take on these people, teach them farming, agriculture, and train them for eventually going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  What year were they married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  They were married...1903. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was born in 1903. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I think they were born in 1904. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They were married in 1902, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You were born in 1903.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  On the honeymoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The story was that...uh...actually I think I was conceived in Asia- Minor (laughing). </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And...uh...in order to...I know that in order to give...uh...birth, my mother had to come down...she tells how she came down to her father, the doctor, in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ox cart</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="43">clearing throat) Anyway, my...uh...these...in...1n Hebrew it's called __. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">This farming...this agricultural training 1n...uh...Asia-Minor was very successful, but there was a time when Professor Otto Warberg simply said he couldn't finance it anymore and...uh...so the job...my father still wasn't thinking of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He was still thinking of...uh...uh... <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My father was offered another job to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and...uh...begin training Jews there on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My father didn't want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">In the meantime, his father and the whole family had immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and...uh...my mother said, at one point, that she'd had enough of being...uh...uh...a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">She was not trained for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">She was a beautiful musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And so my father...they agreed that my father would go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where all...where his father and all the Margolis family had settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He would see how he liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">In the meantime, my brother was born, and his name is Otto. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He's named after Professor Warberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And so we waited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> until my father succumbed to the influences of his whole family and decided that we should come and...come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">At that time, I was 5 and my brother was 2, and so we shipped off and that's the beginning of the family history in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Now can you tell us what happened in your earlier life without going into great detail but maybe bringing us up to the time when your activities with regards to the war and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> began.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Uh...How far back do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Well, from the time you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  From the time I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Okay. (</span><span class="sentence" id="62">clearing throat) Well, I was 5 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Now when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , anyone who knows anything about the <span class="COUNTRY">Middle East</span> knows that you don't have to be literate or educated in order to speak 5 or 6 or 7 languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And...uh...I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> speaking French, German, Greek, Turkish and Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But no English. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And...uh...my mother brought the...uh...we...we sailed over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with a maid because she couldn't handle two little babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And...uh...the maid was Spanish speaking, so for several years after I entered <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , these languages became...had become a part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And...uh...some of this will later maybe explain why I even got started in the work that I did much, much later in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh...Anyway, we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where we...my father went into the business of his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My mother continued with her music. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We were educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , eventually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lima</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , where I went to...uh...where my father opened a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we ended up really...I won't go through all the different stages of where we lived in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> which was the important <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And that's where my father...uh...went into the insurance business. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My mother continued with her music and her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But at the end of the first world war, 1918, my mother took my brother and myself back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> for a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My grandfather had died and she very much wanted to see her own mother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So I spent a whole year sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That was our first trip back. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Then we returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Is that where your completed your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and college education? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at...uh...well, I started my...uh...my first...the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> I went to sub...sub...not professional...uh...<span class="REGION">Ohio State</span> , where I got my B.A. And then I continued with professional education at Western Reserve, School of Social Sciences they used to call it in my day where I graduated as a social worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  And what sort of a career did you embark upon at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Very traditional career. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Uh...I worked...always worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The Jewish Welfare Society, I think it was called in those years, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Case work. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And...uh...I think I...1f I can remember at all, I did leave that work. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I did leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I felt that I had...I wasn't growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I wasn't learning anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was becoming repetitive, and so I took a year off and...uh...came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And...uh...without getting a degree of any kind, but just wanting to get some new ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And so I spent a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and then I was called back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> by the Jewish Welfare Society, offering me a job of training volunteers to do Big Sister work. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And that became a challenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Seems to me that I was always reacting to challenges, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">To do something different and something new. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> and trained volunteers for the National Council of Jewish Women, I think about 3 or 4 years. (</span><span class="sentence" id="103">Pause)
QUESTION:  At what point did you become involved with the...with the Joint.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Well, the Joint comes much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I'll tell you first...uh...after a couple of years of that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , the same restlessness showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I heard that there was a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">In fact, I was told that there was a job and they were looking for a Director of their Jewish welfare work. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I went down for an interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">This was already in the 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I was hired. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , and that's the first time I ever left my parents' <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and was on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And...uh...started working for the Jewish wel...became...became actually the Director of the Jewish Welfare Society of Buffalo, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It took a long time to set up a good welfare service there which would be accept...where students would be accepted by the...uh... <span class="BUILDING">University of Buffalo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It took me about 4 years to do that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I liked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I had many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was settled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And then one day I got a telephone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">19...Christmas 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And it was Cecilia Rasoski on the telephone, head of the...uh...not Joint at that point...1t was the...uh...Jewish Refugee Service because already Hitler was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Refugees were coming tn in the 30s, but they weren't running like much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were people who had means. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Most of them professionals who saw the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in time and got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And we were receiving them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> like in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And...uh...I thought I was really there for good until the telephone call came from Cecilia Rasoski of the Refugee Service, which was working together with the JDC, and now we'll call it the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And she said to me she had heard from somewhere, somehow that I knew Spanish, and there was a very serious problem in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Refugees were beginning to flee from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe, and...uh...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> were coming in, but there were problems in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The money at that point was being given by the JDC, but the JDC didn't have the official...uh...it was working together with the National Refugee Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I didn't even know that I was a employ...employed by the Joint at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so what Cecilia asked me to do was to, with my experiences as a social worker, with my Spanish language...there were multiple problems down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Would I just go out or go...nobody flew those days...sail to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> and look over the picture and be helpful? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Also with...because of my language abilities with the Cuban government, which at that point in time was very corrupt. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">It was the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batista</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="134">clearing throat) Some...uh...some people...there were two ways of coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">One was to get a false visa somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for $165, and the other was to find...to...uh...to...uh... really...uh...have a $500 legal bond which relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> would send...would send down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And...uh... would eventually ended in the S...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> ...the famous affair of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , was that...uh...Jews were coming in or the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I was heading was called the Joint Relief Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Already the Joint was coming in to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Actually, the Joint financially always was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And...uh...they...uh...those who had legal $500 bond were allowed to land and some of them were taken into <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was very chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And we heard that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were on the way, and there was at...at one point my whole diagnosis of the situation was that this is no job for just a person like myself to deal with the government, and that's when I called the JDC on the phone direct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Where were you at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  You joined the <span class="BUILDING">Havana office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Expecting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> to come in, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to come in with refugees and knowing that we wouldn't be allowed eventually to land them all because of this corruption inside of <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> with Batista. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And...uh...I phoned and told...uh...uh...whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And then we heard that the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was to come in was the S.S. St. Louis. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">See, the JDC had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and we were in communications like this: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And so I insisted that this 1s nothing which I felt I should handle alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was more political than social. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">My Spanish language didn't do any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Uh...And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The JDC went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And I can't remember the name of the lawyer at this point, but a very competent, legal lawyer...uh...man and was sent down by the JDC who...uh...had his ends with Batista. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And I don't think I have to repeat...there're books and stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">and everyone knows what the S:S. St. Louis meant. (</span><span class="sentence" id="159">Clearing throat) Our great problem was there were hundreds...I don't remember the statistics, but there were at least 5 to 6 hundred people on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Only a few could disembark who had real $500 bonds, and that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was stationed there and not allowed to come into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> by the...by the Cubans, and it was going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Well, the last thing we wanted was for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ...that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because that would have been the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So for about a week...this 1s 39...uh...we in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , JDC New York, JDC Paris...and it wasn't like today where you could fax and you could phone and you could do things...there weren't all those tech...tech...technological facilities, but we could telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I don't think we ever went to sleep. (</span><span class="sentence" id="164">laughing) Anyway, books have been written, stories been told. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The S.S. did not go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was...disembarked in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="167">Pause) And from then on there was no more illegal immigration into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was all legal or...or not, but... And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in retrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our best to save these people from going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , many of them were caught when the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But a lot of them were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Anyway, I then decided that I was going to stay on and do a...a nice job, a quiet job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And one of the things that I learned...I call this my in-service training period. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I knew nothing about American immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the German language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages and the...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> trusted us completely, we really became the right hand of the...of the...uh... <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Helping with interviews, with languages, with evaluations. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We could do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of great help to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">There were understaffed. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And so I stayed on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> ....39, 40, 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And...uh...I...for some...I liked...I liked <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I liked the climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I liked the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I wasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We were helping to get people to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But one day, one morning the phone rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And the boss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And he said, "Laura, how are you doing?" (</span><span class="sentence" id="186">laughing) 'How are you doing' was not an expression in those years, but he said, "How are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I said, "Fine.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="188">Busy?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="189">Yal, we're very busy here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Well...so...uh...he said, "How would you like to go to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ?" (</span><span class="sentence" id="191">Laughing) I have to laugh when I think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I said, "<span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Where in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="194"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I said, "Oh, Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I'd like to go.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="198">Laughing) I had no idea what he was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I said, "What's the problem?" </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He said, "Well, we've been...first of all we've had a request from the State Department that you should go to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">You should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Because refugees are pouring in from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It's a open <span class="DLF">port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">No visas are necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The Chinese don't care who comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We've been sending money to a Jewish committee of local leaders there and..uh...the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> is swamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> is swamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peking</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> needs help. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The...uh...the State Department doesn't have anyone who knows the German, and so...uh...and they've seen the kind of work you've been doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Will you go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I said, "Alright, I'll go.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="213">Laughing) That's about as much of decision making as I've ever make. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Anyway, I flew up to get really some basic orientation of what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Nothing was really going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> ...the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> was swamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">There was refugees there who had visas, valid visas that the U.S. was ready for accept for their coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but there was no personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So...uh...and then, of course, by the time I got there, in 41...much later in 41, May 41...uh...there were almost...there were thousands and thousands of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The situation as very chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But I wasn't supposed to do much about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I was supposed to help the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Just in retrospect which is (clearing throat) different from the way we travel now...uh...it took... went over on the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Pan American clipper</span> that ever trans...that ever sailed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pacific</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It took 5 days and 4 nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But it was very much more civilized than the way we travel now. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Anyway, my...my...I had to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I couldn't get to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> on...on a Pan American, and I had to wait for a whole week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> before I could get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> up the coast to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And when I got there my first...first <span class="NPIP">place</span> I went to as the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> ...the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They gave me an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and I began interviewing, helping them. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But at the same time I had to get to know the Jewish community structure there of local residents. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The chairman was an ex-Dutchman called Spillman, very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And they were they ones who were receiving the JDC money to feed these 8,000 people who needed feeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So...uh...all this was done with JDC money. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I got to...I got to...uh...but the refugees were already...had already heard that someone from the Joint was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I wasn't supposed to get mixed up...and they were coming to my <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">At the same time I was sending in all my reports of the situation I found among the refugees and how it was being handled. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">All of it went through the pouch, and I...very soon...it took me a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">In June...I got there in May...1n June I issued a definite ultimatum to the JDC in which I wrote that if I were to stay on they would have to...this is not a one- man job. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They would have to send out someone else to work with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I knew...I knew that Manny Segal, who also was a social worker whom I knew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> who was working with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , always said he'd like to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So I said, "Either you send Manny or someone else, but this is not a problem I can handle alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Or else I'll come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="242">In June 1941, that ultimatum had been issued. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I had no reply yet, but in June 1941, I think it was...the...the exact date isn't important. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I think it was the 21st of June, the Germans had walked into the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We, of course, knew this by radio, but it was very distant. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So I got a cable from the JDC a few days after that saying, "In case communications are cut, you are authorized to borrow on the promise of us to repay the amount of money which is required to take care of the needy" (because we had 8,000 eating out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> ; we had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to support, and there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Now these sums seem like nothing today, but in those years it was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And...uh...so I had this cable. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">That was June, July, August 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I was just beginning to get to know the whole refugee problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I continued to work with the...with the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> ...with the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> , but my focus was really upon helping these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And...uh...August 1941, I got another cable. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">SHIP OUT TO MANILA. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">DON'T...DON'T COME <span class="BUILDING">HOME</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">SHIP OUT TO MANILA AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Well, to get out at that point...the American marines were all leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">There was a feeling of war, but nobody was thinking of Pearl Harbor, of course, as you will hear later. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">The Japanese had been fighting the Chinese for years before that, but they had never come into the international settlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ...the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> coming out were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> with Army soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Through the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> , I managed to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I had the cable, DON'T COME <span class="BUILDING">HOME</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So...uh...what does one do? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">There were...there was a nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I used to take trips around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , but I never could stay away very long because I was waiting for instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And finally, this is already August. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Q; August 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">41. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Uh Huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">September. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Telephone call. (</span><span class="sentence" id="274">clearing throat) September 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">September. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Telephone call from Mo Levitt from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="277">Laura, we've just come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We've been to the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They assure us there will be no war in the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="280">You can go back and Manny Segal is on his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And it was clear that we were taking over the whole program, using the local Jewish committee as advisory, but the money was coming to...1n the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Manny Segal arrived December Ist, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">By that time I had a pretty good idea what was going on over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q</span> which 1s a section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> where the Japanese were already...had already occupied, but they had not come over to the International Settlement yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The refugees were all...those who couldn't afford to stay in the International Settlement were all housed in the Japanese sector. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Uh...I had then, before Manny came, I had a pretty good idea what the problems were and what kind of reorganization was required, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So...uh...Manny arrived, I think it was December Ist, and I gave him an orientation and we started going out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q</span> , and we organizing the whole thing and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> on December 8th in the morning in...uh...uh...<span class="REGION">Hawaii</span> ...where the Japanese struck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Pearl Harbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Pearl Harbor where the Japanese struck. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It was December 7th, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">By us, it was December 8th, 4:00 AM. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was on the...on the _____, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> where all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="293"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ships</span> of all nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Was the biggest port of <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We were bombed out of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hotel beds</span> practically with the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And we looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> in the Harbor were burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Japanese had come across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , marched into our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , occupied the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We were at war. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">People gathering in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> below. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We were...the first thing we did when we realized what it was all about was to tear up all the reports we had been sending to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We always kept...we didn't have a secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">You couldn't trust...you couldn't have a secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">You couldn't trust anyone at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We had been keeping carbon copies for ourselves and doing our own typing. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But we realized we were at war and this is it, so the first thing we did, Manny and I, was to tear up all our papers, flush it down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Because we didn't know what was going to happen next. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We were held in our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> ...there was an English broadcasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The Japanese took over and broadcast in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We were just sitting there and watching broadcasting...listening to broadcasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And down below people just mulling. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Mulling, mulling, mulling. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Millions of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Couple of times, we went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We couldn't go out because every <span class="DLF">door</span> , every <span class="DLF">exit</span> , there were Japanese soldiers with bayonets. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Then we got...uh...we were just listening...we were able to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Uh...we were listening to the radio the whole time, what was next. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I think it was about 6 o'clock in the evening when the English broadcasting came over saying that people are now free to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So we went out and some friends of ours already, both Chinese and foreigners, were downstairs waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They had been waiting for us all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">We went out and we had a good Chinese dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But what do we did next? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> in the pre-Pearl Harbor days was a very social kind of place. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And...uh...I had to go through...my round...my round of dinner parties and entertainment and at many of these affairs, horse races, I had met Captain...Japanese Captain Inasuka. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Captain Inasuka had been living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">He's Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And...uh...I was told that he was very...he liked Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And that after that...Pearl Harbor, he had moved into the same <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that we are living in, which was the best <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and he was already up in the <span class="BUILDING">Pent House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He had already occupied Sir Victor Sassoon's <span class="BUILDING">Penthouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So what do we do next? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Refugees were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> , scared stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They were all stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">No passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">No identify of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And I, Manny and I talked it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I said, "Manny, go down and tell them we're working on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Not to get excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Not to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Something's bound to happen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And I made this decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I had my telegram from JDC that I could raise money to be repaid at the end of the hostilities, wherever these hostilities would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So I phoned up to Captain Inasuka. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He remembered me...he remembered me because we had been to social affairs together and received me very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Made the tea ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Very cordial. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Then we got to the nitty gritty of what I came for. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Showed him the cable. (</span><span class="sentence" id="349">Pause) And I told him that I was prepared to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It's true that I am an enemy alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I don't know what's going to happen with me ext, but for the foreseeable future apparently I'm free, and I'm able to help him, meaning helping the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">That I would be able to take over, Manny and I, the whole operation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and keep feeding the people if he would give me permission to raise the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Because without his permission I wouldn't be able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I think my last...what was my last sentence, which I didn't learn in the school of social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Uh...I said, "Look," I said, "You, as an occupying power, cannot afford to have hungry people riot. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">You're responsible for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">On the other hand, I can help you, so they won't riot if you'll give me an okay to raise the money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">On one condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">That I do not...now what was it he said, "I do not take money from enemy aliens," meaning Europeans, but wherever I could raise it I...he also did something else that was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We had a remittance a few days before Pearl Harbor of money which I was already coming in our name, Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">He arranged for the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> to open so that we could get money out, because it was there, before we could start raising money. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And then he also...then the American Red Cross had lots of cracked wheat which had been shipped over and stored and I...I had contact with the American Red Cross and they said, "Look, take it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But I had to have his permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">He gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So we had cereals that we could give to our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">That's about where we were when I had to start raising the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Break’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Now. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">People who... There was plenty of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="374"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> was a city of wheelers and dealers with all kinds of black money, <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> money. (</span><span class="sentence" id="375">Pause) I let it get around that we had something to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And money started coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">The <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Eventually the money started coming in and Manny and I took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The whole year of 1942 we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We weren't interned yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And...uh...
QUESTION:  We want to...we want to break now. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We need a break now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  We need a break now. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We really do.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Would you please continue? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">A; Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Anyway, it was clear we were

id="394">And...uh...uh...so that I...we began to take on some of the old timers...uh...Polish, non---non-enemy nationals, Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a long time and whom we could trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And gradually while on the one hand we were working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q</span> and trying to set up the programs for the helping and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the money ad all that and raising the money, we were also beginning to train another committee, voluntary committee, to take over because it began to be clear that we were not going to be able to stay out forever because we were enemy aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And we got a very good committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Very, very good committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Many of them had been...uh...there for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Russians who had fled the revolution and who had made their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and who were very fine community leaders and whom we could trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And the...the one committee that we set up, Mr. Bitker...we called it the Bitker Committee, Mr. Bitker was the Chairman, and we felt very secure in giving him power of attorney after...1f anything should happen to us to ensure that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Then, of course, in the middle of all this, we did a very...uh...unusual thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Uh...the old <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> that were feeding the refugees when we arrived...when we took over, were very old <span class="INT_SPACE">Chinese kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And they had to be stoked all the time with coal and more money was going...we made an analysis that more money was going into coal than into nutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Then we heard that one day that out in the French concession of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , there were some new boilers that had just arrived the day before Pearl Harbor and were standing there...uh...assigned to the Sassoon Company, but were never used. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So I went up to the Sassoon Company, which was still in business at that point, and I asked them for permission and they said, "We'd be glad to give them to you but they...we as British...as a British company, can't give you that permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We're as much enemy aliens as you are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So what did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We had a very good friend, a Polish engineer who looked at those...uh...boilers and said, "Laura, you've got to get them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So one night when it was dark and...uh...there were millions of people buzzing around on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> all the time and the...and the rickshaws were going back and forth and nobody was paying any attention to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We hired a group of coolies and this engineer, Manny and I went out to the French concession and we highjacked the two big (laughing) boilers, and brought them through the masses of people going into the...buzzing around in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Nobody was paying any attention to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Taking them over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and we got them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q.</span> And from that point on, we built a new <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> which was really giving nutrition and we burned up the old <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">That's one of our fun stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Anyway, it got to be around the end of...uh...October, November 42, the rumors came and one day we were notified by radio...there were no television in those years...that the Japanese authorities are asking all enemy aliens to prepare themselves for internment. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">You would be allowed to take in anything you like to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">They didn't tell us which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , your...uh...linens, anything that you want to take in. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Food...this is...they were beginning to prepare us. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he was going to an all-men's camp over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paoting</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I had not received a notice yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So we packed him off, and a month later I got notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And...uh...I actually took my own folding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> and...and...uh....a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> full of canned goods and stuff and things and...and then...the...the Japanese were a peculiar race. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It's a...an interesting group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Uh...They were very, very permission with us, and I was taken to another camp of couples, and single men and single women outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Right now the name of the camp escapes me, but it isn't important. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It was the beginning of 43, I think February or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which, of course, was surrounded by barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It was a old <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking here and there and everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And...uh...I got into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with 40 women, and...uh...first thing I did, when I saw the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was to see at the very end there were <span class="DLF">windows</span> going...getting out to the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was an old <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> , and I quickly took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and dumped it in that <span class="REGION">area</span> so that I would...all the 40 women would be in back of me and I would see the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">That was the first thing I thought of. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Anyway, it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> ...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> , and all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We never burned them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We just put on more clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Now, the Japanese were very good to us I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old Shanghailanders that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and under the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But that's something I've never had. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I've never had any kind of feeling about race, color, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They gave us everything that was due to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They brought in the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">We had to cook it ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And they said to us, "Listen, get organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Put up your committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Do what you like. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">We'll bring in the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And organize your own social activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Do anything you like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising.” </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And so the first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And someone came to me and said, "We want you to chair our committee because you've had experience.” </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I said, "I am Laura Margolis with no experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I am a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I have a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I don't want to be...I don't want to be known. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I don't want to have anything to do with all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So I made avery quick ___ as we say. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I...uh...realized that when you're near the food, it's important so I took kitchen duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And...uh...the other thing was...oh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...there was barbed wire all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And out there were <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and we were supposed to grow are own vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And I've always liked farming anyway so...uh...and just being out of it is...1s very important for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So I chose the second chore and that was to go out and work on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And that worked very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">But then came 4, 5, 6 months of that and people were getting sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And that's natural in all of <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I mean they were carrying them out by the dozens to the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , diarrhea and all that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And...uh...nothing was happening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I was as healthy as a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">But I decided I had to get out because I just could stand the collective. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So I knew I wasn't going to commit suicide but I had sleeping pills and I wasn't going to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But what I did was to eat less, grow weaker and...uh...put on my Sarah Burnhart act. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And so I was sent to the doctor...to the doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who was an American doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And he gave me a permit to get out to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because he said I was very sick, which I wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And I got out to the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It was a <span class="BUILDING">English hospital</span> and Dr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he remembered me from...from contacts we had before Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And they put me in a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> , and when he came to make his rounds in the evening and he saw me there, he caught on immediately because no matter what he did, I was in good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">But he said I was very sick and so he said, "Now, there are two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">You shouldn't be in a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I can get you a <span class="INT_SPACE">private room</span> , but if you want a <span class="INT_SPACE">private room</span> you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> for permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But I can give you a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with another lady on my own responsibility.” </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I said, "I'd rather take the lady...the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the lady.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And what happened there was that she was really a lovely, lovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the <span class="BUILDING">German bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and he used to come to visit her every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I had no right for visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And one day he said to me...he said, "You know," he said, "You are not allowed visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Wouldn't you like to tell your friends <span class="NPIP">outside</span> that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And that's the way I saw Mr. Bitker. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I saw my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I got...I got the message out. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And...uh...I was there for 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">They kept me out in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then came August...July, August 43. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis and the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said, "Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before coming here I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Consulate</span> because the Swiss had the authority over all enemy aliens.” </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And he said, "You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So I'm going to release you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">You go back, start packing and in September you will...uh...be re...on that...on that exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Your name 1s on it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He said I also found out that your name was on the first exchange which was a diplomatic exchange, but the Japanese took you off because they needed you. (</span><span class="sentence" id="501">Laughing) So I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Before I went back, I sw Bitker once. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">For the last time! </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And I got a...because he had power of attorney to raise money and in...1n the name of the JDC to repay. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And...uh...nobody knew when the war would end you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So I said, "Look, I'm going to be out of this pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Just give me a...uh...up to date account of what the situation 1s financially so I can get it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Well, he gave me the whole accounting up-to-date. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">When we were prepared in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...that was September 43, that we were to pack and we were going to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">This was the beginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I had always these figures, and I took toilet paper because I knew that there would be a body of search...body search before they...before we were left to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And...uh...I took the...uh...the toilet paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I wrote every piece of...all the figures down, rolled it up and put it in the rubber pants...the... uh...top of my panties, so that...uh...1t was invisible and... uh...started packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And in September 43, I forget the date exactly, we were...those of us who were on the list from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were taken on a...to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ship</span> as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goa</span> where the exchange would take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">That was in...1t was Portugese Goa which was part of the <span class="REGION">Indian mainland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And...uh...we got on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It was...uh...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ship</span> which had a passenger capacity for about 100, and we were hundred and...one thousand five hundred, because we picked up people on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And what they gave us women were...uh...like stalls hat you put horses on and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> were full of fleas. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So the first...the first night we took all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> (laughing)
QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  The first...uh...night...we tried to sleep with those fleas, but we couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We took...all of us women, took all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> out and threw them into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chinese sea</span> and slept on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Just took a blanket and slept on board all the way through. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We picked up people in the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We picked up people in...uh...uh...what was...before <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> , what was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">A French...uh...anyhow, <span class="DLF">French port</span> , and finally we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goa</span> , where they...uh...
