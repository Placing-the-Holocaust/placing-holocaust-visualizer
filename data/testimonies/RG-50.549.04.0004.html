<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And when were you born and where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born March third, 1951, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Were you named after somebody who died or was murdered during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Rose was my father’s sister who died, and Ann, my middle name, was for my mother’s mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Were you told anything about them? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">What do -- what -- what does it mean to you to be named after somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Is there any particular significance? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  Well, a-aside from it being Jewish tradition to be named after a dead relative, I hope that I live up to what I -- the stories that I’ve heard about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Give us an example.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  My mother’s mother was a woman of great breeding and taste and refinement and culture, very family oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Very much 1n love with life and society and busy with philanthropic interests and family affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  I know, of course, that memory goes only back so far, but it would be nice if we could go back into your earlier childhood and gets a sense of what -- what family life was, what -- what do you remember about your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So my first question would be, give our listeners who don’t know your parents a sense of who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Your father -- who did you see o-of -- ho-how did you see your father when you were younger, and how did you see your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Well, my mother stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so I saw a lot more of her than my father, who worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My father, I always knew had family. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I never met anyone of my mother’s family until I was eight years old and we met an aunt through marriage in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I know that my mother took me abroad when I was, I believe one year old, but of course I don’t remember having met her then. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But I never knew family from my mother’s side, which was a tremendous loss th-that I felt as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I knew that there was a huge, huge part of childhood experience, having grandparents and March 15, 2001 aunts and uncles and cousins missing from my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was very keenly, keenly aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Did you -- let’s -- be-before -- well, let’s -- let’s follow up on this then, before I ask you again a little bit more about the personas of the -- the persons that your parents were. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Ho-How did -- how -- did you -- how did you ask them about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Did you ask your mother, how come I don’t have grandparents? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">How -- how did this evolve?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  My father came before the war, so his experience was growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from late teenage-hood on, here, as his brothers and sisters, who had been farmed out from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And they all had international experiences, some went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , some -- I mean, every brother and sister was sent to a different relative around the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">His parents both died before I got to know them, his mother outlived his father, and was alive when I was born, but also died when I was quite young. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother’s side of the family only came through me -- to me verbally, because there were no -- no pictorial histories or scrapbooks, or mementos handed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So it was only her stories and my imagination that gave them any kind of reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  How would she talk about them? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  She talked about holidays that she remembered when she was growing up, what her family life was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The talents of the various people. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The intellectual capabilities, the accomplishments. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Her family was very accomplished in many different <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Sh -- and I think that’s why she had great hopes that I would be a pianist like one of her cousins who was world renowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That didn’t do t -- I didn’t do too well there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Maybe a dancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The Russian -- the Russian ballet instructor told my mother, save your money. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So th -- so -- so there were -- there were quite a few talents that I did not pick up from her fa -- <span class="REGION">family side</span> , but reading and education were certainly something that she impressed upon me and I developed my own curiosity in pursuing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Do you remember the circumstance of when you sort of first became aware of your mother’s experience during the war, when you realized she was a Holocaust survivor, although at that time you would not have thought about it in those terms, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  No, the dawning was gradual, but the visual indicator was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My mother was always physically very different than other mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Her physical disabilities worsened as I grew up, and it was because her condition was becoming much more visible and apparent to the outside world that then I came to understand March 15, 2001 that she had been born perfectly normal, but because of the beatings that she received in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was the cause of these physical abnormalities worsening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  How did -- how did you learn about that, though? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Did you ask her questions, or did she under certain condi -- circumstances talk about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Ho-How did you learn about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  There was never a special day that I remember, that was set aside to say this 1s what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was, I think, always part of my consciousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I think -- I remember one thing, one day I remembered seeing one of my friend’s parents who had a number on their arm, and I asked my mother why she didn’t have a number on her arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So I knew that there was a commonality of experience that my friend’s parents had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and my mother had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but there was a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And I think that started the storytelling a bit more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Did you have -- you just mentioned your friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Did you have Jewish friends and non-Jewish friends, or pretty much Jewish friends and were there si -- children of -- of survivors, other children of survivors among them too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  The <span class="REGION">area</span> that I grew up in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> was a terrific mix of Jewish, Italian, Irish and in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , black. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But for th -- my earliest <span class="BUILDING">school</span> experiences, I would say 95 percent of my classmates -- at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> used to place you in a class of your ability, so the classes were numbered one, two, three, four, so if you were in March 15, 2001 the first grade in the first class, that means that you were the most academically superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So always being in that first class, it seemed that the make-up was 95 percent Jewish at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Did you talk -- did you have close friends, like really very close friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  I still have them to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Oh, you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Did -- did you talk to them -- were they children of Holocaust survivors too, by any chance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  The three friends that I have from when I was 10 years old were all American born and their parents were American born, so no, they -- they didn’t experience the particular childhood that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I had other friends in the second circle of my -- of my associates that had Holocaust survivor parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  And did you talk to your friends about it, and to your best friends about -- about that in some way, did you feel that you wanted to? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Did they ask? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They probably got- came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> --
ANSWER:  Sometimes I remember there were discussions at -- at -- at lunch about parents having nightmares and we would only discuss it amongst ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My mother wasn’t one of those, but -- but I had a friend, Mary Chewbowski who used to tell March 15, 2001 me about her mother’s nightmares, and we were very protective of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was almost a different circle of friends, the immigrant kids, then the other Jewish kids who really didn’t have any way of relating to what it was like to have to be a nurturing support to your elder parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was -- it was a role reversal even at a younger age that some of my friends had. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">My mother at that point was stronger than some of my friend’s parents, who were much more emotionally crippled at that stage, at that stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My mother was stronger, but the years have taken their toll.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Let’s stay in the earlier years a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">What do you remember from your family life’? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">What di -- what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">What was the relationship between you and your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  I was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I was told very early on that my mother had lost all her family, and when the doctors told her that she was not supposed to have a child, that her response was that she didn't survive the war not to have a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So no matter what the physical cost was going to be -- which put a little guilt on me because I knew that she was taking a risk and did damage her condition further by bearing me, but that she felt that she lived for a purpose and the purpose was to have a family, and that was me, but there was only just me. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I didn’t have any brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I didn’t have any grandparents or cousins, or people from her side that she could relate to. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">March 15, 2001
QUESTION:  When you look back, what kind of a child do you think you were? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">How do you see yourself as a -- as a -- as a younger child? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I don’t want to lead you, just how did you see yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  My mother will probably say that I was spoiled, and I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My -- I was- | was -- I will admit that my parents were extraordinarily generous of their time and the amount of input that they put into my cultural awareness. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I grew up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I tell everybody that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I -- I spent more time going to <span class="DLF">botanical gardens</span> and <span class="BUILDING">zoos</span> and Radio City Music Hall, and shows when I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I turned around and did the same thing for my daughter because my -- my life -- my childhood was so full of extraordinary outings, that I couldn’t wait to turn around and do that when I had a child, so I -- my -- my social activities with my parents were extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Maybe that was to make up for lack of family affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  I take it from your -- from what you just said, that you did not experience that necessarily as -- as a pressure, but more as an opportunity, or was it also sometimes a -- a -- a pressure behind this to -- to -- having to fulfill certain expectations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  No, I wasn’t -- I wasn’t exposed to these things necessarily to have them drummed into my psyche that this 1s what you must know in order to be a cultured person. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Everything was on an equal basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Going to the movies, or seeing the March 15, 2001 Rockettes was on the same level as going to a ballet. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So everything was done with a sense of -- of fun and a special occasion, and dressing up and going downtown to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So it was -- it -- 1t was never an expectation that I would be able to then recite to impress anybody what I had been exposed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It was just something that would cu -- just culturally open me up to the rest of the world, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  When you went to the -- to the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of your friends, did you perceive differences? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Was your upbringing a different one? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And if so in what -- in what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  L always believed my parents to be much more strict than my mu -- than my friend’s parents who were American born. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And we’re talking about my Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Some of their parent were the -- brought up in the 40’s here, very liberal, virtually leaning on the Communist way, so that they were allowed to stay out late and make decisions for themselves when my parents said, we have to know where you are and who you’re with and what time you’re going to come back, and so I felt that there was much stronger bungee cords on my freedom than my par -- than my - my peers experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Now that I’m a parent, I don’t know whether it wasn’t a good idea, cause I probably mimicked more than I -- than I want to admit. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But no, my parents were more strict than my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And ma -- and my friends used to March 15, 2001 push me and my parents would explain to my friends why they did what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And ma -- and my friends respected and still respect my parents for doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Are your parents very different from each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Are they -- how -- do you see them very differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Entirely differently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Describe the --
ANSWER:  Entirely differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My mother is the intellectual. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">My father 1s the very easygoing sense of humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">My mother is very nervous and ferociously protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My father was strict, but yet, not as verbal about it as my mother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But I didn’t want to cross any <span class="DLF">lines</span> with my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about your education a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You -- what kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go to in the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , New York public schools were wonderful at that time, and then to, as I said, keep broadening my field of reference, my parents would, on a very meager income, sacrifice and send me to <span class="BUILDING">Swiss schools</span> for the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I always say that there was a <span class="BUILDING">finishing school</span> and th-they finished me off but good. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I’m very polished, highly polished, to a g -- a great gloss. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">March 15, 2001
QUESTION:  I detect the irony, of course, but -- but si -- say -- say a little bit more about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Was it -- I mean, it was obviously a very different cultural experience [indecipherable] Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yes, I mean they sent me to -- they sent me to sleep away camps in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and -- when I was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Some of them were Jewish, some of them were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My memories of them are that I -- I know that they sent me away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> so I didn't have to bear the city heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My -- before I was sent away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we always went away -- my mother and I went to the <span class="DLF">Catskills</span> , and my father would come up weekends, just like the other fathers would come up and visit, so that my summers were very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But then when I became of an age where there- they wanted to also have some kind of growing experience, or benefit to be derived from a summer away, that’s when they looked into these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for me, and I went to the same one for two summers in a row.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Did you thi -- when you were in -- how old were you when you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , roughly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  I believe 14 and 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Did that subject matter ever come up, being in Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was neutral at the time, but sort of the Holocaust, did that ever come up? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  The ho -- interesting, you know, the Holocaust itself did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">There were some Jewish children who came from very nouveau riche families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and there were Arab children there as well whose -- the younger ones were being trained to hate anyone Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The older ones my own age were a bit more tolerant. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">This 1s- you -- you know where -- this was close to when <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had been founded, so there was some leniency and understanding with the children my own age, but the younger ones were already being disciplined to avoid us, and they called us -- they called me the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I re -- I remember that distinctly, that the younger wa -- younger ones would come up to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> when I was sitting with friends and they would say, how could you sit with the enemy? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So it wasn’t the Holocaust, but it was being Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Do you think it was difficult for your mother to let you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  ’m -- I’m sure -- I’m sure fo -- for any mother of a single child, it’s difficult to let a child go, but you g -- you get tremendous satisfaction from seeing your child come back glowing with the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">If they’ve had an unhappy experience, of course you carry that guilt with you also. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But what could be terrible about spending the summer in Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So I had -- I had fabulous times, and it -- 1t certainly made a seed germinate that I wanted to study in Europe later on, which I did in <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">March 15, 2001
QUESTION:  Let’s stick with being a teenager a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You sort of came of age in a kind of an interesting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I mean, the 60’s were rolling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">What -- what had impact? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I mean, there was so much happening at that time, what -- what -- what had an impact on you? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">What kind of music did you like? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">How were you as a teenager?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  I was a very -- I was a very typical teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I was as crazy about the Beatles as everybody else in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Some of my American second generation friends were experimenting with drugs, and this is where the strictness factor came in with my parents, they -- they practically used to sniff out the backpacks of my friends when they came in, were very, very protective about what was coming into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and- and what was be -- what activities were being engaged outside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So I was not as brave, or as adventurous as some of my American friends because I didn’t want to upset my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  In terms of social movements, was there anything that kind of had an impact on you, that sort of was important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  I wanted to belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">As an only child, I always wanted to belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And when I started <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , I thought I would pledge a sorority. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And at the same time, at -- literally, simultaneously, at the time that I was going to be sworn in a secret ceremony into the sorority, there was a huge anti-war protest on my <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And it was one of those lifetime awakening moments, and I said, you know what, what I’m March 15, 2001 doing right now is ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">What’s happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span> is much more important, and I walked away from the <span class="BUILDING">sorority</span> and I joined the anti-war movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  What did you do for them, or with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  I -- I joined the student protests. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I worked for Eugene McCarthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I worked for Bobby Kennedy on -- especially when he was shot, I started my own initiative for gun control and I -- and I took ar-around a petition for signatures and then sent it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That’s when I started becoming politically engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I was just on the young end of being more radically involved in the anti-war movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I was, but I certainly wasn’t the leader, I was more of a follower. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And then as I became a bit more informed, I started working within political movements rather than the more radical ones that were happening on <span class="BUILDING">college campuses</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  I know of course that things don’t always work on that kind of simplistic, linear, logical order, but do you think that the experience of your -- that your awareness of your mother’s past and of the Holocaust and so on, and second World War had kind of sensitized you in a different way, or is that no -- 1s -- is that not -- set apart from it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  The -- the Vietnam war was affecting my friends, and I didn't see it as a corollary to World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I mean, yes, if you want to take war is a bad thing in March 15, 2001 general, but that was really so subliminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was -- it was affecting my friends, my friends were having to go through the draft. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So it was a close, personal fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s talk about your education a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So what did you study, and when -- we have to -- I -- I want to get a few figures in there, so that we don’t get totally lost in -- in -- in where we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You -- you went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> as well, and I got my graduate degree in English, I specialized in Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Not very commercial. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Not very marketable. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Let’s see, I graduated very early, I skipped a grade in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , I entered <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at 16, which is very early, I graduated when I was 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">That -- that is very young, that is very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I wouldn’t encourage many people to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  There were some things that I missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I was -- I was rushing through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so much that when I graduated early, I didn’t get to attend the graduation ceremonies with my friends because I was already at the next level. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So when I graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in January and was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I didn’t go back in June for my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">When I graduated <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in January, I didn't go back in June for my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- so I have no pictures in a cap and gown, even though -- even though March 15, 2001 I’m -- Lams -- I have so many degrees, I don’t have one picture in a cap and gown. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">When I got my Master’s in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , | alre -- I had already moved to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , so I didn't go -- I don’t have a picture of my Master’s graduation, either.</span></p>

ANSWER:  ’72.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  °72. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">When did you go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We have talked about <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but not about <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  [had a -- a political science professor who saw something in me that -- I don’t know, one of those little flickering flames, and he encouraged me to go for a summer program to <span class="BUILDING">Imperial College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and that’s where the passion for Shakespeare was ignited. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I came back and did my -- because everything was on a half -- because I had come in early, I wasn’t on a normal September to June, this is my freshman year, this is my sophomore year. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So I did my last half of my freshman year and my sophomore year back at <span class="BUILDING">Hunter College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I did my junior year at <span class="BUILDING">Leeds University</span> , thrown in with the English students, with none of the background that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="203"><span class="BUILDING">American college</span> at that time was extraordinarily different than English March 15, 2001 <span class="BUILDING">university</span> where they make you specialize in one <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They will pay for your education in a <span class="DLF">field</span> that you have demonstrated talent in. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , they make you take two years of every kind of course under the sun, it’s like a smorgasbord, so that you become out -- well, more rounded, rather than have a very gr -- huge grasp of one <span class="DLF">field</span> in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And then I did my Master’s in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Shakespeare Institute</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  Culturally, did you feel that you were -- that you fit in, or did you feel very different, or what was the -- sort of the situation, how did --
ANSWER:  ’ma hypocrite. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I married an Englishman, but the English students in general -- I got out -- I got along with them, and I -- an I -- and I’m an anglophile, I consider myself an anglophile, but they always kept me a little bit at arm’s length, they always used to call me Yank. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Which to me was distancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">You know, there was always, you know, we’ll have the Yank come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I-It wasn’t that -- and I made friends, and I made very good friends, but it was always just that, you know, I was the colonist. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They were the -- they were the Royalists and I was the colonist. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And it- and it -- that was all the way through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it never changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And then I ended up marrying an Englishman.</span></p>

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Shelly Sherwin. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">This is tape number one, side B. So here comes the question I forgot before. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again, in -- in -- in history class, or what did you have, political science or something? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Did -- did -- did the Holocaust come up in- in a way that -- that was comprehensive, profound at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  It certainly didn’t have the emphasis that it has now. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I think there’s a -- a -- a gru- a greater sensitivity to the teaching of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I think we learned more about World War II than the Holocaust, now that I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It wasn't as specifically defined. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It was a factor, but 1t wasn’t taught as a major portion of -- it was just one -- another fact that you learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You know, there were so many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , there were so many killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were located here and there, and really, the French came in here, the French gave up this. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">It really wasn’t -- it wasn’t emphasized by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">March 15, 2001
QUESTION:  When you talked -- did you ever go to your mother and ask her specific questions, because my -- my -- my guess 1s that -- that there -- there must have been questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Did -- did you go and ask her, or was it more of a -- or did she tell you --
ANSWER:  There -- there -- there were times in -- in -- in the natural flow of conversation when we would be speaking about her family, and I -- I certainly always wanted to know when she was separated from her family, what happened to this part of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I-If she talked about say, the concert pianist, what happened to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But it - it -- 1t wasn’t that I was asking her for a -- a history course on the Holocaust, it was in -- in th -- in the form of just more nor -- normal conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  Was it difficult for you to hear or to ask about specific things that had happened to her? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Was it -- I mean, she was your mother, was it difficult to -- to -- to -- to hear specifically what happened 1n terms of --
ANSWER:  I never -- it was a very fine <span class="DLF">line</span> that I felt that I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I never wanted to ask her things that would bring back very painful memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I had a visual reminder every single day of what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Every time I look at her now, the entire Holocaust experience is encapsulated in when I look at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So knowing the specifics was not as important as grasping the entire experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And it happened 1- in the smallest things. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">When I had to go shopping with my mother and nothing ever fit because her deformity is so limiting in what she can and cannot even try on. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I March 15, 2001 was aware of it on so many different levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Her physical limitations, her lack of energy, her -- the pain that she’s in, the brace that she has to decide whether to put on or take off. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">If I have to take it now and -- and wash it, how gentle I am because there are no people left that we can find who can duplicate the making of these type of handmade corsets because now everything is corrected very early on in surgery so people don’t have to suffer the type of scoliosis that she has. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So when I would ask her, it really was a familial re-memory -- memory that we would talk about rather than the brutal beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I -- it was hard enough for me to look at her without having to know exactly how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And -- and -- and it’s still very difficult for me to imagine someone doing to my mother what had to have happened to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  And you couldn’t really bear to hear it, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I have -- I have a very heightened sensitivity to films, to photographs, because I don’t have, as I said earlier, any scrapbooks of family pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Every face could be a face of a relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So there can be -- even though the number of my mother’s family is finite, when I see pictures of hundreds, they all become related to me in a sense because anyone of them could have been a true family member. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I'll never know which ones were. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It -- on rare occasions my mother has found books and she has found not Holocaust photographs, but from before the war, photos of people who were in her family, in very formal, stylized portraits. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I look at them March 15, 2001 almost like I look at a picture of Queen Victoria, there’s -- 1t’s such a far relation, it’s saying my goodness, this is a person who was in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It’s -- it’s extraordinary because there wa -- there was such a stop, there’s such an abrupt halt in any kind of family continuity because there are no letters or photographs or visual sightings, or meetings or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It’s rela -- it’s trying to relate something personal to a picture of an entire stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So my sensitivity towards Holocaust materials is -- I f -- I find as I’m getting older, it’s harder and harder for me to -- to look at the stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  How did it make you feel -- how did you feel about the perpetrators? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">How -- how did you feel at that -- at the earlier time? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Did 1t make you angry, sad? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">What was sort of the overriding response?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  To be brutally honest I have tremendous reserves of hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It’s geared towards the older generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I don’t know who 1s innocent and who is guilty, I just know that guilt by silence is as damning as guilt by participation. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">In my work on the <span class="BUILDING">college campus</span> with the Jewish student group, we have our Holocaust memorial service every year, and the Martin Niemoeller poem, when it’s read every single year, is more and more telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">When they came for the Communists and no one -- and -- and I didn’t say anything, and then they came for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">No one said anything for my family, no one hid anyone from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">My family -- my mother’s family was March 15, 2001 not lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">My mother was the only lucky one, and she doesn’t feel lucky in having survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">She feels guilty because there were so many shining, singular individuals in her family and she feels that why her, and -- and why did they perish and why did she survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So, it’s -- it’s very difficult for me to try, I -- I try to be as open minded and tolerant as I -- and give the benefit to everyone of a younger generation, but to my mother’s generation, I don’t want to have anything to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I’m just too suspicious and too angry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  And does your mother feel the same way, do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Did you talk, or did she ever talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  We talk about it sometimes, and I -- I think -- I think I’m -- my mother really tries to be forgiving, it’s -- it’s getting harder, because when we talk about it when there is a rise in neo-Nazism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> now, what has the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> learned? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Why should we be -- be more fo -- mo -- why should we be more forgiving when the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s opening itself up to this type of hatred again? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It’s -- it’s too threatening to be able to say that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has learned its lesson and it’Il never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It could. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I’m not saying -- I’m not saying a Jewish Holocaust will happen again, but that kind of -- of rise of that party 1s very disturbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">March 15, 2001
QUESTION:  We will maybe come back to something [indecipherable] it’s kind of awkward now to go back, but I would like to keep the chronology a little bit alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So you went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> eventually? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">You -- you studied [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I was here -- here -- here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and then back and forth in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  Okay, and you me -- and you had the idea of becoming what, professionally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Well, if I hadn’t met my husband, I was going to continue on and do my PhD. in Shakespeare. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I had a professor whose best friend was Lawrence Olivier. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So I had my -- my PhD. dissertation practically written for me, I was going to do Olivier as a Shakespearean interpreter, and have full access to his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and notes and movies and -- and then I fell in love, and married my husband and moved back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So that’s -- that’s one <span class="DLF">road</span> not taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about your husband then, a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">When did you meet him, what is his name, why did you like him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Let’s see, we -- we met and fell in love and became engaged within one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We just had our 27" anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">If my daughter told me that she met somebody and was getting engaged in one week, | think I’d kill her. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But -- we didn’t announce it until the third week, we thought that sounded very mature at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And my mother was on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> after I told her that. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Talk about protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We met March 15, 2001 three weeks before our final exams, he was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> there, I was doing my Master’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We both could have done better on our exams if we had stared at the books instead of into each other’s eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I don’t think either of us have any regrets about either not doing so well on our exams, or -- or getting married, and ge -- or getting engaged, actually tha -- as quickly as we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  What was the attraction, apart from the eyes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  My husband has an extraordinarily keen mind, and a very dry sense of humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And I knew that as loquacious as I am, that I needed someone who would give me <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">My mother says, you always married your husband because he gives you center stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Which is a very acute assessment. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">My husband is -- is an attorney and only really speaks when he needs to. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So we are -- we are very opposite, very, very opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I’m very outgoing, he’s much quieter. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But when he says something it’s so incisive, and so intellectually challenging that there are few that I’ve met that intellectually excite me as much as my husband still does.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  Is he -- is he Jewish too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  What about his fam -- he was -- you met him in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  I met him in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  And he is -- he is British? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  So, how did you negotiate where you would live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  I said as long as I was going to get dressed up and be a bride, that I wanted to get married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and have the few distant relatives that I had grown up with participate in my wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we decided to come to <span class="REGION">California</span> on our honeymoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And wi -- the decision was really very easy, when my husband saw that it didn’t rain for three weeks straight, he said, why go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So -- so he came here before I was finished with my actual dissertation, so we got married and we were separated for three months in our first year of -- of marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So he came here and petitioned the <span class="BUILDING">California bar</span> to be able to take -- take the exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and finished up my dissertation, and then came back and joined him in <span class="REGION">California</span> and we’ve been here ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Did you want to have children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, there was never any question. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It was only after I had my daughter, and she was a colic, she scared me off having more. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But my husband’s an only child, and I’m an only child, and I guess we didn’t want to feel outnumbered. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So we were very -- we -- we both knew our -- our values are so in sync with each other, we knew that we wanted to give her every opportunity in the world, so if it meant study abroad, if it meant all the shows in the world, like I had gone to in my youth -- we March 15, 2001 wanted to not spoil her, but certainly expose her to as rich a childhood as I had had. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So we made the decision just to have one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  So that was a conscious decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  It was a very conscious decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We wanted -- we had always, from when she was, I think, in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> , we had always felt that if she was intellectually capable of going to a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , that no matter how it -- we -- we would have to sacrifice, we would send her to the best one that she got into, and she got into <span class="BUILDING">Duke University</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  What is her name and when was she born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Her name is Alexis Danielle Rothschild-Sherwin. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Alexis is also for Anna -- Hannah, my father’s mother, and Sarah, her -- her -- her -- her Hebrew name is Hannah Sarah, which is a blending of from my family and my husband’s family deceased relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Alexis comes from Abraham, who is the distant relative who was partly responsible for bringing my mother over after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And he was the only grandfatherly figure -- he wasn’t a grandfather, obvious, but the only elder figure that I grew up knowing as a loving relative and so when my daughter was born I wanted to honor him because he had taken my mother into his family after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  Were you a working mother, or did you -- did you stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  I worked very hard at being a mother, and as my child grew and was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I worked very hard in her <span class="BUILDING">school</span> s -- because of the <span class="BUILDING">pub</span> -- the state of public education and the lack of funding for the arts. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I always took it upon myself to teach the -- the subjects that they didn’t have money for, so in terms of cultural and -- and creative enrichment, I would create programs, get grants and then bring them into the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And I did that all through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  So education in your family then, is a very important thing too. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Education, arts, culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Nobody had a choice in the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Yes, wh-when given the choice, if -- 1f I -- if- if I don’t ask for jewelry, then I always ask to have tickets for a show. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It’s -- it’s the creation of a memory that’s lifelong. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">O-Other things, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and clothes and names on handbags, or things like that, never meant anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">E-Even now, 1- if I wanted to and could afford it, I -- it -- 1t wouldn’t mean any more to me than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">But going to a show with my family and enjoying that experience, that’s what we enjoy doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  So what -- let’s talk a little bit about Alexis then, and then we sort of mix everything up again and touch on a few other issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">What was her education? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">You- she -- did she go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , too? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  We’d -- we’d -- my husband is a product of English public education, and I was a product of American public education. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And even though we live in a very upper class area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> where many, many children, even more so now, go to <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> from the earliest ages on, we decided that we wanted her in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> with children from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And that’s why I worked so hard to try and make the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> have as well rounded an approach to the education that the funds would allow. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And she went through public high sch -- public education all the way through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And then when she got into <span class="BUILDING">Duke University</span> , we said, well that’s your dream <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">It was her number one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and she was -- she had an -- an extraordinary experience there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  So describe her a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Are you close to her, first of all, and secondly, what kind of personality -- person is she? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">What are her interests? </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Where is she -- where is she going, as far as one can tell at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Is -- is -- as -- she was an only child, for the first half of her life she was my husband’s personality, very introverted, very shy. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I kept on saying, you know, how did she pass through this body and not pick up any of my genetic material whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And then we did make a -- a choice in terms of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">She could have gone to the very close, local public high school, or she could go to a brand new <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which was 24 miles away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malibu</span> , also public, but they wanted March 15, 2001 to start a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And for the very reason because her personality seemed to be -- she was in awe of other kids, and I remember feeling, in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that I wasn't the top student, so that the expectations were always that these are the top students, and I know where I belong in the pecking order. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I didn’t want her to face that same kind of <span class="DLF">glass ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So we made a choice to send her to this brand new public sc -- <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , where there wouldn’t be any expectations and there wouldn’t be any reputations that she would have to face or undo. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">She was allowed to reinvent herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And she metaphysically changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">She became -- immodestly, she became me. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">She -- she became political. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">She became the president of the entire <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She -- whatever was going on in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she became involved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">She invented the traditions that are now being passed from <span class="BUILDING">class</span> to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">She was allowed to express herself without fear of being pegged as one of the lesser students trying to work their way up. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And so she was one of the golden children at this new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">That completely made her so confident of herself and her abilities that there’s no stopping her now. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a very seminal decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">She hated the traveling part of it, because it -- 1t entailed being on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">school bus</span> for an hour each way every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">She -- she didn’t go with her friends from <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> to the -- some had already siphoned off into the <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , the others were going to this <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But we thought that she would get lost in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that March 15, 2001 large. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It was -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> of almost 3,000 students, and the new <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , she was in a class of 120. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And they were the first grade that went year by year through. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So she was the first ninth, the first 10", the first 11", the first 12". </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So it made her who she is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It absolutely changed her.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Everything from soulful revelations to ethical decision making, to just general, this is what happened to me today. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Ever since I had my surgery in August, she has made me feel that I don’t miss anything tn her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">She is the first one -- my husband is my rock, but if I need to talk to someone, I talk to my daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  You also talk to your mother a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  I talk to my mother, but what I -- I filter what I tell her now because there’s only so much that she can handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  But you used to talk, I mean sh -- is it true, she told me that for -- for many years now you almost talk every single day, that --
ANSWER:  Oh, we still do, we still do, we still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And also sometimes several times a day, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But I don’t tell her quite everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">She can’t -- she can’t emotionally handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">If I’m going through something, if my -- 1f my husband’s going through something, and he’s diabetic, but thank God, he’s very healthy, but -- or my daughter is going through some unhappy romance or something like that, we don’t tell her all the details because that’s what she feeds off of. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And sometimes that kind of negative information will not be good for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  I was just reminded, when I talked to your mother in her interview, and I asked her about her family -- not -- not the later family, but her earlier family, she -- she said there was a very close relationship between her and her mother and her grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And it seems to me almost there is now another mother and grandmother and -- and granddaughter situation, which is kind of interesting [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, I-I find fascinating the fact that my daughter 1s able to more objectively talk to my mother about the Holocaust than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">In the last couple years, I have March 15, 2001 evaded -- I will listen to my mother tell me whatever she wants to tell me, but I don’t want to dwell on it to the extent because -- and I have been the one who has been instigating my mother cutting back on her speaking engagements because I know emotionally what it takes out of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And so I’m taking on the protective mother stance, saying, every time you go to another <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and give a talk, the nightmares come back, the memories come back, it takes a physical toll on you, I wish you wouldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Yes, there is a need for these stories to be told, but I feel that my mother has fulfilled her obligation to her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And so ’m the one who says no to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">My daughter is the one who does the research on her own. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">My mother tells my daughter, and we -- we both will sit there and listen, but my -- it’s not that my daughter is not unaware of the emotional toll that it takes, but her insistence in knowing overrides sometimes, her pulling back from asking just -- just one more question of my mother, while I will stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  How old is she [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  She just turned 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  Maybe it’s harder at that age to -- to understand that too, when you yourself are so energetic and used to --
ANSWER:  In the -- in the last -- I would say in the last two years, she has become more aware of my mother’s vulnerability and so in the first couple years when my March 15, 2001 daughter was at <span class="BUILDING">Duke University</span> though, she was responsible for bringing my mother out as a speaker for the Holocaust, and it was very widely attended. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And then my daughter took a Holocaust studies class and had my mother come out and speak specifically to the class as well as the rest of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And I think that sometimes her -- the mixture of pride and objective academic curiosity in wanting to know everything for herself 1s -- is her motivation. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And I’m watching my mother get older, and weaker, and so it’s much harder for me t-to go into those <span class="REGION">areas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  Do you -- do you feel that what’s called Holocaust education now, or awareness of the -- of the Holocaust in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , is going in the right direction, or 1s it still not -- not presented profound -- deeply enough, well enough, or is it at times overdone, or how -- how do you feel about what -- what’s happening --
ANSWER:  Not having -- not having gone through a formal Holocaust education course, I know bits and pieces from my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The teacher that she had at <span class="BUILDING">Duke University</span> was a graduate student who was making her life work doing Holocaust studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And she was very sensitive because Alexis was the only one in the class who had a survivor as a grandparent. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The other children came to it from an entirely different perspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And so she would always say, Alexis, you know, today is going to be kind of tough, we’re going to watch this kind of footage or examine this, you know, are you going to be okay with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And my daughter, 99 percent of March 15, 2001 the time was able to stick it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Whether it got to her later on in the day, she was able to stay there for the duration. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There was just one or two times where it just became overwhelming and she couldn’t stay in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  No, I wasn’t -- it sort of in general, just do you think that sort of Holocaust education in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is going in the right direction? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Is there enough of it, too much of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Is it doing what it should be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  If it was going in the direc -- in the -- in the direction intended, then I think there would be a lessening of -- of ethnic cleansing and wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Obviously it’s not achieving its ultimate goal, which is what the survivors, I think, who tell their stories, would wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I think the -- their purpose in telling their stories is not only a testament to their survival, but also as guideposts to the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So we shouldn’t be seeing the pictures on the television that we’re watching on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  I think this 1s a good time to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">This is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Shelly Sherwin. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">End of Tape One, Side B March 15, 2001 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Shelly Sherwin. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">This is tape number two, side A. Let’s come to sort of a -- a few issues that are potentially very large, but I would like to leave it up to you how much you want to respond to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And the first question is, what kind of role does your Jewish identity or faith play in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  I wouldn’t be anything else but Jewish, given a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I love being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I think being culturally Jewish is a tremendous part of my personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I don’t know who I would be, or what I would be like 1f I wasn’t Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I mean, it’s that much a part of my psyche. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And on the other hand, when it comes to pure religion and observance, I’m more observant than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">My husband and I made that determination when we had our daughter, that we wanted religion to be a spiritual backbone. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Not strict, not strictly enforced, but certainly the spiritual foundation that it gives someone in terms of an identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">That she would feel as comfortable in her skin being Jewish as I was, but I had the unique experience of growing up in a very <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , so that’s why it’s also interwoven for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And my husband grew up in a Jewish area in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But 1 -- but a -- a New York Jew is an entity unto itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">What you see on television is what I g -- is what -- is what my life was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">My -- my daughter when she was going through March 15, 2001 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- it’s interesting, in my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they did not speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">My mother’s family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> did not speak Yiddish because her mother’s side of the family was Sephardic and that was the -- obviously the s -- the <span class="REGION">Spanish side</span> , 1t was not -- it was the Ashkenazic that spoke Yiddish in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And I had a summer job once, working for a doctor in the Catskills, and I picked up a tremendous amount of Yiddish, because it was with an elderly Jewish clientele, and I brought up my daughter with these little Yiddish expressions. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And she felt so comfortable in her Jewish skin, that she would routinely use them in her compositions in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and sometimes get comments on the t -- on the papers from the teacher saying, I don’t understand this word. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So I encouraged her creativity and said, if that’s the word that best describes how you’re feeling, then just put a footnote at the bottom of the page, which is what she started doing in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">If -- if a Yiddish word sufficed, she would use it, and then put a footnote in for those people who didn’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And so even when we converse now, it’s not that either of us are fluent Yiddish speakers, but th -- there are certain expressions that we do use routinely. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So that’s -- that’s where I fit in in terms of being culturally how I identify myself, and in terms of personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I cannot split where my Judaism leaves off and where the rest of me begins. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They’re -- they’re inextrictably entwined. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Religiously is a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">In -- in following the rituals, when my daughter was going to March 15, 2001 <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> in preparation for her Bat Mitzvah and my husband and I started a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> with 18 other couples, it was an extraordinary life changing event to be in on the -- on the formation of a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I -- we never worked as hard, we never sat on as many committees, we never had so little free time as we did, and yet we look upon that as the most golden period in our lives because we did something really so constructive. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But when it got down to actually being alone with my thoughts with God, it’s a love/hate relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">My mother came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> questioning her faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">She will tell you now that if she was given a choice she wouldn’t come back Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">My father loves <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and loves being surrounded by things that are familiar with him, he’s -- he’s -- he’s traditional and a little bit old-fashioned in that sense, he doesn’t like female cantors. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">He likes that good old solid, you know, Jan Pierce type of voice, that -- that brings him to his spiritual satisfaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">When I was diagnosed with cancer in -- breast cancer in aug -- in July, sorry, in July, I had my surgery in August, I didn't question why it happened to me, and I wasn’t as angry at God as I have been about why my mother had to suffer through the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I could accept my fate more easily and hopefully with more grace than I’ve ever been able to accept what happened to my mother and her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And so when it -- when I think in terms of blind faith, I don’t have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I know that Judaism is built upon equal parts of blind faith and questioning, so that you come to a -- a soulful March 15, 2001 understanding of your relationship in -- in the world, and with God as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And yet, the Holocaust puts a -- a huge <span class="DLF">roadblock</span> that sometimes prevents me from attaining more spiritual insight. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I’ll never be able to get past that. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Sometimes I have a very accusatory tone in my thoughts when my mother is suffering the way that she does. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I never had a normal mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I never experienced a mother without pain, without even the unspoken kind of neuroses that the Holocaust caused her to develop in her personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">She is an intellectually brilliant free spirit, and yet the Holocaust harnessed her intelligence and imprisoned her in this failing, tortured body. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And so I’ve been very angry at God for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  I meant to ask you what impact did the Holocaust have, or your mother’s experience, on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And that, of course, 1s a major answer already, that you just gave. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Is there anything else that you could add to that if you think about, in terms of different perspectives on something. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">If you think about that experience, your mother’s experience on you, on your life, on your outlook on life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  I’ve always tried to be the best daughter that I could so that A, I wouldn’t cause my mother any unhappiness or unnecessary disappointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Of course, you know, I’d be superwoman if I never disappointed my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But I’ve -- I’ve carried the weight of trying to keep my mother happy because of all the unhappiness in her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">It’s a tremendous burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I feel that I pay for the Holocaust in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Because March 15, 2001 of what happened to my mother, I live my life in a way that is encumbered by it, rather than being free to have experienced a mother who aged gracefully without all these extra layers of mental and physical pain that were artificially -- s-she was subjected to. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Unnecessarily objected to -- subjected to. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It’s -- it’s -- it’s a -- I feel that -- I can’t say it any more strongly, I feel that I am paying for the Holocaust every single day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Fr-From your perspective, is your mother paying for the Holocaust every single day? </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Is she, however reluctant a little bit to -- to make too much of that in -- in -- in her public presentations and interviews, maybe? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Do you see -- how do you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  For posterity, I will tell you, and I hope my mother will not hear this because it would bring her pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">My mother will not admit to the world at large -- terrible -- terrible an -- analogy, but what a -- what an overwhelming cross she’s had to carry every day, every step, every time she puts on her iron brace in the morning, it’s the Holocaust coming back into her life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Her coping system -- if -- if one of us has a cold, or the flu, or anything normal, it’s magnified 10 times because nothing 1s allowed to happen to her family any more, because everything happened to her family before. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So h -- there’s no sense of normal perspective or proportion in what goes on in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The joys are -- are tremendous, wonderful, sweet joys. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">What could be just a minor disappointment, because her life 1s so limited now by her March 15, 2001 physical limitations becomes magnified 10 times more, because sh -- because she doesn’t have the outlets that a physical life would allow her. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And she has nothing left but this interior life. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Everything is magnified.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  How -- how does your father fit into all of this?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Do you want to stop for a moment? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We will stop for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So we were just talking about how difficult it 1s to -- 1-1t was to -- to let your mother know, and so that she wouldn’t worry too much about your health, but is that also very difficult for you, not being able to -- do you have to censor a little bit what -- what -- what you are saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  By nature I’m very spontaneous. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">My husband is the chess player, my husband 1s the -- is the bridge player. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">My mother is an extraordinary bridge player. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">That all involves strategy. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">That always know -- those people have a talent for knowing when and where to say and do the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I don’t have that particular capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So usually something happens to me and itll come straight through me without a filter or -- or a censor. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It’s not that I’ve tried to learn how to strategically tell my mother things. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It’s just that sometimes now I spare her. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And it’s not that I don’t want to be honest, it’s just that I don’t want to burden her. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">It’s -- it’s very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">There are things that she has to know, that sometimes you just can’t sugarcoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">But there are times when I have wanted to be entirely candid at the moment that things were happening, and her responses were such that, oh, but I went through something so much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Or but, you know, if you’re daughter is unhappy at this age, where do you -- what do you think I felt when I was her age? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So I can’t be involved in this kind of one-upsmanship and I can’t compete, no one can compete with her March 15, 2001 experiences in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And yet it’s unfair to hold the Holocaust over my head as preventing me from being entirely open with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So sometimes the easier route is just not to tell her everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">It’s not that she’s not sympathetic, it’s just that, look what -- what -- what I went through, this is not a reason to complain. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And yet, everybody -- in everybody’s life there are things that happen on an everyday basis which are bothersome or annoying, or distressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And no, they have no comparison, there is no relevance to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And yet, the Holocaust is used -- I don’t want to say as a battering ram, but as this stick that we have to measure our experiences against -- versus hers, and sh -- her -- she tops everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I mean --
QUESTION:  Was there any patience then, with the trivial childhood problems that one tends to have, like with yours? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Was -- how did she deal with that, when you were young, and --
ANSWER:  She was much stronger when I was younger, the Holocaust didn’t factor in m- my -- I went only once to a Second Generation meeting, and I felt that it was one of these group hug type of California groups because someone stood up and said, if I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with a grade that was less than stellar, my mother would say, 1s that what I ho -- survived the Holocaust for? </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I never experienced that, my mother never did that to me when I was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I mean, if I failed a math test March 15, 2001 it was because I was lazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It had nothing to -- it had no reverberation, or -- or association to -- you know, you should have done better because of what I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I didn’t want to have to live through these other people’s nightmares of what they went through with their parents, because I thought it would -- because my childhood had been so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">My mother was stronger when she was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It’s now that she’s older and becoming more fragile on so many different levels that the Holocaust is becoming a factor in daily life and conversation when we talk about normal experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But when I was younger, it just -- it wasn’t used as a motivation that some of these people had as their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And my mother didn’t have, or didn’t use me as a buffer in real life when I was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Some of these people also say that their parents would wake up with nightmares and they would have to comfort their parents, kind of almost like children of alcoholics that have to parent their -- their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And I didn't have that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I had wa -- considering what my mother went through, I think I had an extraordinarily normal childhood, and it’s just changed in the last couple years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Why did you go to Second Generation in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , was that -- was there, in spite of the experience afterward, sort of a genuine need to maybe compare experiences, or to even get advice, or to exchange experiences, or were you prompted by somebody, or was it a -- a curiosity thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">March 15, 2001
ANSWER:  M-My mother had heard about it and she wanted to -- wanted me to go and see what it was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Because my background, my childhood was so normal, I mean, you know, there aren’t normal childhood groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Nobody goes and seeks out a normal childhood group, so I -- I didn’t think that there was any particular reason driving me to go to a Second Generation group, be -- be -- because I -- and -- and I - it was borne out, my speculation that these kids didn’t have a normal childhood, and so they did need a -- a support group, where they could share what they went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I probably need it now more than I did years -- then. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">But I’m more concerned with dealing -- being a mother of a 22 year old, and being a mother to my mother who 1s 70 plus. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So I’m in the middle right now, and don’t particularly feel that I have the time or the -- or the emotional energy to go to one of those groups right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And plus I’m -- plus dealing with the recovery from my surgery is pretty time consuming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  Did you ever want to go to -- did you ever go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And it’s not that I didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">My husband’s a stick in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> , and we didn’t leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> until our 25" anniversary when we went to visit our daughter in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But he’s always had this ext -- extraordinarily heavy workload that we just didn't do any international travel and now after this -- this brush with March 15, 2001 the hint of mortality, we’ve made a promise that we will travel more extensively. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So I don’t know if <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is my first destination, but who knows?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  What is your relationship to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ’? </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Have you ever been there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  I -- I was there when I was 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And I’m -- I’m the one who 1s responsible for sending, not all of them, but many, many students on an international program that’s free for 10 days to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that’s an extraordinary experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So I’m reliving the wonder of my ninet -- when I was 19 and went there and -- and having the privilege of sending these young people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="577"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was part of that education that my parents gave me when I was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I did it in a summer when I went to visit friends who I’d made in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And they said, if you’re coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , then you better stop in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> cause otherwise you never will, and they were right, I’d never -- I never went back and so I got to see <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , I stayed with them for three weeks and then I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  I seem to recall that your mother said that your daughter has a very special relationship to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Has she been there many times? </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Or do I recall it wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  No, no, she was there on the very first trip, this exa -- this hello Israel birthright trip that I’m talking about, she was selected to go from <span class="BUILDING">Duke University</span> on their inaugural trip, it was over the millennium. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And you do everything from March 15, 2001 archaeological digs to climbing Masada at dawn, to camel rides and Bedouin dinners, to floating in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dead Sea</span> , to meeting with Palestinian leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It’s a very cerebral and spiritual experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">There is no emphasis placed on religion itself, it’s just that the reasoning behind this trip, there are three multibillionaires who are underwriting the cost of sending 50,000 students internationally to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> free for 10 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And they just felt that this generation didn’t have the bond with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that my generation and my parent’s generation had. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So they’re trying, in hopes to foster this type of link with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and it’s working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  What kind of relationship does your husband have to your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Or -- and to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Well, my mother wishes that my husband would speak more. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">But after 27 years of marriage she should know better. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">The -- if you don’t ask my husband something in question form, you’re not going to get an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But my hu -- I think my husband 1s a wonderful son-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He cares deeply about my mother’s welfare, both mentally and -- and physically, and 1s very solicitous of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And for as emotional as an Englishman can be, he tries, he tries really hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">He’s -- the greatest thing that my husband ever did was introduce my mother to the computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">March 15, 2001
QUESTION:  Oh, I have to talk to her about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Is there anything else that you would like to say to -- to round this out that I haven’t asked, or that -- that came up in the process that you would like to sort of say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  I hope a Holocaust never happens again, not only for the people who are directly involved, but for their descendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">There is such a lingering affect of this kind of devastation. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">It manifests on so many different levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">It affects the way people react to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I wish that lessons could be learned from the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I wish that people who are in my position could also affect a change, but sometimes you’re so busy dealing with the victims, that you don’t have time to take care of the rest of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I try on a small basis to interact with my peers on an international basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And yet, I would be less than human and less than my mother’s daughter if I didn’t say that her experience has shaped my world view. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I try -- I try on a daily basis to be a better person. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I’m not as forgiving as the ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  Okay, well, thank you very much for the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">This is the end of tape two, side A interview with Shelly Sher -- Sher -- I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Shelly Sherwin, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I would like to just follow up one more time, so this was not the end of the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I forgot to ask what your profession 1s right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">You’re working at a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="616">March 15, 2001

QUESTION:  You like teaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  I like being the boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And the other thing that keeps me very busy, because I do love writing, I -- and I’ve -- I’ve free-lanced on a book, and I just enjoy the process of writing, is that I have a business with a partner for college admissions, we’re college counselors. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And I work both with <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students and then college graduates on their admission application essays. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We help them from the entire creative process of formulating their ideas to the finished product of the essays. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So it’s a very creative and involving and sometimes nerve-wracking process, waiting for those acceptance letters to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But it -- it keeps me very involved with students from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> age through graduate school students.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  So of course now I have one very last question. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">What are your hobbies, what do you do for fun when you have time to have fun?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Okay, well <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> certainly 1s a priority. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Since we had the chance to travel two years ago to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> when my daughter was doing a study abroad, that re-sparked my wanderlust, which I had before I married my husband, and he has promised that he will take off some time and we’re going to go back to Europe again. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Museum trips are still a -- a very constant feature of life here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Reading, I’m a great reader, I always have. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Music, I -- I keep a little bit of my youth in my tastes with -- still listening to the Beatles, but I find that classical music is more satisfying now as I’m getting older, especially driving in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">LA traffic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And love my dog.</span></p>
