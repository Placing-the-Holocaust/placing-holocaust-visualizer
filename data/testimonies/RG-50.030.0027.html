<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  My...my mother was born and raised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farouh</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And...uh...most of the Jewish people that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> towards the end of the 1700s and beginning of the 1800s...uh...settled down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farouh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And there was a very large community lodged and relatives over 126 families within approximately 100 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">By the 1900s they all disappeared so that <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> ...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farouh</span> today is...there is no Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But my mother was born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">She moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> with my grandparents which originally came from...uh...uh... <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> , <span class="REGION">Spanish Morocco</span> and <span class="REGION">French Morocco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Therefore, my name Bitton which is a French, actually a French broken name. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uh...And of course my mother was married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> and...uh...we were five brothers and five sisters, 5 boys and 5 girls and...uh...I attended...the uh...the...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> ...and...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ...was a <span class="BUILDING">private Jewish school</span> ...uh...where we were taught Hebrew so we could...uh...we could read...uh...the prayer books. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Because my family came from a reasonable religious...uh...family. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Not orthodox, but...uh...religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And we all had to learn Hebrew and...uh...we did so. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my...my grandparents, primarily my grandmother spoke some Spanish and...uh...Lidino actually, and some of the Portuguese. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And...uh...basically, I...1 grew up amongst the Jewish community which was very, very small at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">There was not much activity amongst the Jew youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">There was actually not too many youth in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And...uh...my oldest brother had actually begun to have some girl friends, not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My father was very upset about it and...uh...as I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to learn Hebrew by...uh...a lady that also was a Moroccan...uh...Jewish teacher, she had in her...uh...l1ving room several pictures of...uh...of...uh...of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , of _ <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at the time from the <span class="DLF">wailing wall</span> and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And...uh...I was always impressed by those pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Always! </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And that created in me a great desire at the time to...to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Already from a little, early childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And suddenly when the opportunity knocked in 1943, then I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But in the meantime, my Aunt Esther ____ Bitton, my father's sister, used to work at...uh...there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">Portuguese soup kitchen</span> primarily at the time used for the poor...the poor Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And during the second world war, obviously this <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> became very very influential in assisting the refugees to have one hot meal a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And it was there that I really began to...uh...hang around a lot of time simply because I was...uh...I was very impressed by the various languages spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh...At the time I spoke Portuguese and a little bit of Spanish, but when you begin to hear Yiddish...lot of...lots of Yiddish...uh...lots of German...uh... Hungarian, Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I remember families from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh... was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and uh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">There were probably within the dozen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> ...uh...each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> would care approximately hundred...10... 10...uh...people so the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> for the refugees was within...uh...150 persons sitting capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And there was another small <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> which was for the Portuguese...uh...the Portuguese community. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , soup kitchen was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I was born in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So was my entire family. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was a very small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but nevertheless they took care of...uh...of the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So...uh...and...uh...1t was during this period in history that...uh...one day while I was at the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> I hear...one family walks i1n...several children, father and mother...very well dressed, not dressed like a refugee as such...uh...with crumbly clothing, but really very nice and neat...uh...and I...I asked the gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I said...I fact I told him, "Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">This...this is for the refugees...this <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And he said...uh...uh... ... in Portuguese...he said, "But we too are refugees.” </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And...uh...I couldn't quite understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was a teenager at the time, but still...uh...I asked him, "Why is that you are refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">You...you are Portuguese. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">How can you be a refugee.” </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And...uh...he asked me to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And it was then that I...I met the very famous...uh...humanitarian, Dr. - _ who told me that he was the ex-consul of <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And he went on to tell me that he had been expelled by the Portuguese government simply because he had refused...he...he was asked to refuse to give...uh...uh...visas to the...to the Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And...uh...as a result, of course, he was removed from his position. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He was disbarred because he was a lawyer by trade also, and removed from the diplomatic corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And...uh..I met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> at the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> within...I do not remember exactly if he was 4 or a half a dozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We spoke briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He was there in <span class="DLF">line</span> standing with...uh...family to get his hot meal and...and to date I couldn't...I...1 never got out of my mind simply that the..the men of his stature...of his caliber...uh...that had ...had really helped saved lives, was punished in such manner by being removed from...from his...doing his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And...uh...I was very impressed and these image always stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Uh...I...1...I don't believe I can really tell you a great deal more about Dr. because I met him such a short few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But I remember portions of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And...uh...uh...I remember the...the refugees primarily more so that were there in most cases because they were the fortunate ones that had received visas by Dr. in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Uh...I remember a family by the name of Deutsch, father, mother and two children who...they set up a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in the most busy <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> which is called the Sheadu. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">In fact, it was burned out recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Was on the portions of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that was burned...ancient part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And...uh...

<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Well, since you asked...since you asked...uh...uh... (clearing throat), there was a time during the war that in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , they had found wolfrum. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And that's some type of a metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I do not know that much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But it's sometime of a metal that you must mix...uh... with other metals...uh...specifically for armory. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And, of course...uh...that became very, very exciting all over <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And many people just left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and went to the north to try to work on the <span class="DLF">wolfrum mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And, of course, being an adventurer myself...uh...me and a few friends, we decided that it was the time for us to go and dig wolfrum too. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So...uh...we...we went there, but we were very...most unsuccessful. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">No sooner than we were there, we turned around and came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> because, of course, we had no...no...no means...no...no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And...uh...however little money we had...uh...didn't last that long, and I came back, of course...uh...very, very broken-hearted that I did not make a million escudos on the <span class="DLF">wolfrum mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But...uh...that was an exciting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And as much as life generally speaking in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> at the time for as far as I can remember...uh...other than going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the time, I...uh...being a member of a large family and my father, at the time...uh....God bless his soul, was working for the Portuguese printing department of the Portuguese government. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And he certainly did not earn that much money either. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So, other than <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we would pick up whatever job we could, me and my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And...uh... I was involved in the dismantling, believe it or not, of World War I mines and...uh...we had a little wrench. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">There must have been a million bolts and nuts in these <span class="DLF">mines</span> , and we spent all day unknotting these...these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh...Another job that I took was...uh...working on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> by derusting the ballast of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">You know, if you're familiar with the ship ballasts, they're little oval holes at the bottom of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and you go in with a little swimming suit and you go with your feet and your head and your...your arms and you stay there all day with a little hammer, and all you do is knock down the rust that accumulates in these little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> , You know, they're very small <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Uh...That was another part of a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I did other minuscule jobs and working on...uh...helping to manufacture of...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , painting, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And...uh...by and large, the...uh...there was an exciting period in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I remember the...uh...uh...there would be a...practically every day in the newspapers some story about someone being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">A spy or...or some activity...foreign activities...uh...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And there is another thing that I used to do with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">German Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And they had always literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Tons of literature! </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They would give away propaganda about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So we, of course, very diligently used to take as much as we could, and the moment we were out we used to toss it out in the garbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So...uh...this was one of the things that we did...uh...for some obvious reasons...uh...actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Another one function that I had...uh...was a neighbor of ours had a little shoe...uh...<span class="BUILDING">horse shoe shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He was a big, big man and...uh...he couldn't read or write. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And...uh...he always...whenever I came back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was my function to come to him and read to him the newspaper and what was happening in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Because I used to like to read a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And...uh...and somehow or another we...we became very good friends, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And here was this big fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He couldn't read. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I could never understand why he couldn't read either. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But he was an older gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And he was still doing the horse shoes...uh... in his <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Blacksmith? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I don't know how you call exactly, but...uh... So, by and large...uh...other than our going every...we had to go every night to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> because my father...uh...my father insisted that we go to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> every day...every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You cannot come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> unless you've been to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> to the services. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And...uh...every Friday night obviously...Saturdays, we used to go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So we conducted a reasonably...uh... I would say a moderate Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And...uh...our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was...was, of course...uh...kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My father was quite kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And ...uh...we had a very large family, as I said...uh...uh... five boys and five girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Although two of them were born...I...one girl...my youngest sister, Rachel, was born after I left <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I did not meet her until 17... when she was 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And my brother, Jacob, was...uh... few months old when I left for...for __, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So...
QUESTION:  Did you feel...how did you feel being a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> once the war...once the war had broken out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  My only memories in this case is...uh...I didn't feel any...uh...truthfully...from the part of the Portuguese, I had no...no feelings that there were anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Never had that feeling while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That's the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Uh...But...uh...by being in...uh...on a...almost on a daily basis, mixed with the Jewish refugees for a given period of time, that in itself inspired in me more so the desire really to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Number one, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and to join the British Army, and go and fight the Nazis, which I did as a matter of fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">You started to say...you had started to tell us about the Sofnut. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Tell us about the refugees and _Sofnut. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">What happened?</span></p>

We used to walk for 4 and a half hours from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nahariyya</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeeheim</span> because you go up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and you have to walk to____, and you had to bypass small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arab villages</span> and you had to do it...uh...all night long pretty much and you had to do it to such an extent so that you would not create too much noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">If you had...uh...a squad, which is equivalent to a British army squad of 11 men and the officer, uh...we...uh...we used to have different squads going to different <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And...uh.... also to make a mock attacking, attacking YYeeheim_ because we expected there wwould be problems as...as... as the kibbutz would be...be put in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And there were many problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They were...they were attacked many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">But...uh...obviously, the attacks could not come from the _ because there was no shape, or form that as you were climbing this...this...this high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , big so to speak...uh...you always made noise, no matter how careful you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">You could hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You could hear it way a way before you were...uh...<span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They could hear the noise already. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So basically that's what happened in...the __. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And from there, of course...uh...we...uh...(clearing throat) ...uh...there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> where I lost my...my very best friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I used to live at the time...shortly before that I used to live with a family by the name of Shinerman. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And...uh...there was two boys and a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Moses, Alisa, and Salome Shinerman. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And...uh...

</span><span class="sentence" id="538">It was very easy to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">You throw in a few large rocks and no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> can by. </span><span

...uh...about...for about 5 miles was a zig zag, very zigzaggy. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And...uh...the Arabs used to call it the <span class="DLF">road</span> of backshis. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The...uh...backshis is an Arabic word for tipping. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And the reason being that...uh...way back before I even came to <span

parallel to the...the <span class="DLF">Lebanese border</span> so to speak...uh...every Arab sheik that had orange or citrus groves or lemon groves...by paying the British backshis...the would make the <span class="DLF">road</span> came to their gates, so they could come with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and as a result the <span class="DLF">road</span> went like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">That...that's a fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And...uh...so as the _ came about, and I can tell you the precise date and the precise hour was March 23rd, 1948 at 20 til 3 in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Uh...There were brutally attacked by...by the arm of ____, the known...uh...Arab liberator of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And he was very...very smart man, and he was able to illude the Israeli army...uh...at the time...uh...by running away through a...his own __ <span class="DLF">road</span> that he made to the <span class="REGION">Western Galilee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But nevertheless ...uh...the attack on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> to _____ was quite successful simply because there was a serious of tragedies. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Uh...Number one, the officer

the time...we did not have a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at that time there..he said, "Isaac, you must stay here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And in fact he even talked to our

id="556">But...uh...Alisa Shiner, which was like my sister, came to see the baby at...before she left even to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And...uh...I said, "Gee, I wish I could go, but the doctor did not allow me to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I had to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> left...uh...uh...a few...1t was a few minutes after the left Nahariyya, they were all ambushed. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Because they...they ...they waited until the...the...uh...last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had passed this zig zag and then they started to put some rocks and they put some rocks at the other end of the zig zag so that they first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> unbeknown to them was able...was able to break the <span class="DLF">barricade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in <span class="DLF">line</span> was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> had armor. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The Israeli, at the time, they put armor and they welded these heavy metal plates in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> so that the driver would not be hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Unfortunately, as the driver of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> was trying to turn around, they threw apparently some of a molotov cocktail. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And both of the tires were shot so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> then became paralyzed in...in closing the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So all the other 6 or 7 other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> ...they were behind them...okay...we...we felt the same...the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">They couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And as a result the...uh...the people were given the word apparently to...uh...save yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And... uh...very, very few were to...to survive this incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Uh...they were able to escape by hiding on the water that flows from the

because in the meantime it was beginning to be dark, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> had left earlier although it was 20 in the afternoon, 20 to 3...uh...March...uh...uh...1t wasn't quite full summer yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And...uh...they survived by staying there in the dark, and maneuvering. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Some of them arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nahariyya</span> and they...what...the next thing what happened was the British mandate was...the army was and the

</span><span class="sentence" id="575">Could not live Nahariyya. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And it was one of the greatest disasters that we suffered...uh...in...uh...1n the Haifaam...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifaam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Uh...We lost 40...49...I believe 49 members. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">But then there was an action that...uh..some...some said in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> later on there was a...uh...an action from the Haganah to make up for the

British...the British had the Arab Legion in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And the Arab Legion had some <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Mount Cumberland Haifa</span> , if you remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They had some...so the...the Israeli intelligence was able to find out...the Haganah...that there was a convoy coming in from <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> full of arms and ammunitions for the Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Let me tell you, that I saw personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And I have never seen a thing like this in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">For several days, the entire _ Cal the <span

of those actions at the time, I just happened to come to _____ with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> which I is I...I used to bring food and all kinds of things from <span
