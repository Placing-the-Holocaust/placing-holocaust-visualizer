<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Eugene Lipman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , October 13, 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Uh...Gene, tell me something about your family and growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Uh...My father was a small jeweler in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mill district</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , my mother a Pittsburgher by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father was born in Europe...uh...had and raised children and was the compliant homemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Uh...We never had any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My grandparents,...uh...all four, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> until my grandfather, my paternal went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">In 1925 or 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebration, and then came back permanently during World War II because the idea of the Germans taking over <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was an unpleasant idea to him and so he came back and he died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We are a long lived family. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My paternal grandfather was 93 at the time of his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Uh...I grew up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mill district</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> to the age of 7, then moved to the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Squirrel Hill</span> because I had to go to Hebrew and all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Squirrel Hill</span> , and I completed my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> education at <span class="BUILDING">High School</span> , 40 percent Jewish and...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And started the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pitt</span> because I could live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pitt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">This was depression time. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And then in 38...Solomon Freuhauf who was my mentor in this Rabbi business decided that I was wasting my time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> and sent me off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">University of Cincinnati</span> at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">They were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the other...from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They still are. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And...uh...got my degree from <span class="BUILDING">University of Cincinnati</span> , finished 1t <span class="BUILDING">HUC</span> in 1943, having accelerated a year because they needed chaplains so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And...uh...so we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for 22 straight months in order to accomplish this. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">No professor would allow us to give up a course. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">How can you be a chaplain without my course in mid rush five, one of them was known to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Uh...It was required by the military that you have a year of experience before you can go into chaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Worth</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , who went into the Navy and spent a very uncomfortable year there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I was 23 years old and everybody I met in the <span class="DLF">street</span> 23 years old was in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh...The entire American army was in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And...uh...I was not in uniform so as soon as I could get into uniform, I got into uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh...We had married...in...1943, the day after ordination. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was a long weekend, and...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  When and under...when did you go overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">What were the circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Well, I had decided very early on that my war in World War II was the <span class="REGION">European theater</span> , not the <span class="REGION">Pacific theatre</span> , even though I wavered on that because of something I'll mention in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But I had really decided that I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I had asked the Chief Chaplain's office to ship me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Going overseas was unavoidable. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And so...uh...1n February of 1945, I got orders to go overseas and didn't get there until April because that's the war the army worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The...uh...thing I didn't mention to you was that while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Worth</span> , a member of my congregation who had rabbinical connections...uh..asked me, right after Yom Kippur services, as a matter of fact, if I had ever thought about becoming a pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Uh...He taught fairy pilots, the women pilots.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I want to hold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And can you stop the tape please? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Alright, just hold the tape for a minute and then we'll pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We've had construction problems on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The sound is coming through the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">These people are just marvelous. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">What we will do, we'll back it from the beginning of that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I'll ask you to describe... Dean, tell me about...uh...the gentleman in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He came up to me after services on Yom Kippur and introduced himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We had never met. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I had been there all of about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all Rabbis were chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, "When do we start." </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And he said, "Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock." </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And (laughter) I said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I can't do it tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Give me a couple days." </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Because, among other things, I didn't have a flight jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You couldn't go up in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There were no closed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">That's a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So he taught me to fly in his little piper cub which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I notified the...uh...Jewish Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing this in case it was of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And the Chief Chaplain's office was very interested, they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So I got my license and...uh...after <span class="BUILDING">Chaplain's school</span> , which was 5 weeks we got our assignments and I was signed to the armored force. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I thought, you know, "Typical Army screw up!" </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But...uh...It was done deliberately. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I found out that they just didn't want Chaplains flying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They wanted Chaplains praying for troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And so I did go to Europe instead of doing Island hopping in the Pacific was what they had been talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So I arrived in Europe in...uh...April 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The...uh...voyage was of interest historically. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I became the radio announcer on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ...I...on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I probably was the only one who could read English, something of the sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And several times a day I did news broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of Franklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That was a very discouraging and depressing...uh...1dea. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Who...who was Truman became a very important question to those of us who were on our way overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We also had a...uh... marathon bridge game going. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army career ever suggested that we play <span class="DLF">bridge</span> for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There were eight of us in this bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Several million points were involved in my losses. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Uh...I also agreed to...uh...box for the only time in my life, because they were having a series of boxing matches and they couldn't find a heavy weight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had fought a couple of times before. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We sort of sparred around for three rounds. [...</span><span class="sentence" id="88">uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> from dockside to an <span class="BUILDING">Evac hospital</span> just outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lahov</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And the rumor went around that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been hospitalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again because I was so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I heard that long after I got into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Couple...couple of people were surprised to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I was in this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for 3 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The hospital chaplain, who was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and he and I peddled each night into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where he had met a French couple, and we played <span class="DLF">bridge</span> in French, which was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So I...uh...was put onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop train</span> headed for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Typical 40 and 8 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> and I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me, and then I was standing at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to start and some sergeant was walking up and down yelling, "Who can talk French? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Who knows some French?" </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... "Will some French do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he says, "Three words will do. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And Colonel needs a French translator." </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because he was in the transportation corps running these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop trains</span> which didn't require much military skill. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was a heated <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Pullman car</span> and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh...My job was every time the...uh... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped to tear up to the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> to the engineer and ask him what was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And he told me, "Signal." (</span><span class="sentence" id="107">laughing) Every time, it was "Red Signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I can't go." </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I went back and told the Colonel who was quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I had lots of bad books to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I had a fine, fine trip into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh...wasn't wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">No one knew what to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I was moved back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span> , and...uh...as a casual. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I did not have an assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And then V.E. day came, and we celebrated V.E. day by going from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span> to watch the celebration and to celebrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I didn't feel like celebrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I...Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to celebrate as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The world was over, but in the square in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span> , I saw some men and women in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Clearly! </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Uh...I knew what they were, and they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They recognized my insignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They were Buchenwald graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust whom I met. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Uh... They didn't want anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Uh... But we talked, and...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They were followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I did get an assignment to 22nd Corps Headquarters in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhineland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hildan</span> , not to far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , and I moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Large <span class="REGION">territory</span> , all of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhineland</span> , including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">A lot of troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Theoretically, we were conducting services for all those troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Early discovered that a lot of German Jews and a lot of East European Jews had come into the <span class="REGION">area</span> not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> , but living on their own where they could find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, which many of them could not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So I began to do three things. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">First of all to push military government to find <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income and they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA installation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> uniforms, and that was not a very good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted of a gang coming together. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to them,...uh... "Anybody need to say <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , ...uh...there was frequently somebody who needed to say <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , so we had a short service cottage, and then I said, "Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We need food. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Let's go get it." </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And after the first time in each of these <span class="BUILDING">installations</span> , anybody who could beg, borrow or steal a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ...uh...came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and we went to <span class="BUILDING">army depots</span> and we got food. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I have often had a nightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will some day. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...I know that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in World War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had signed a memorandum receipt for in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and had never turned in. ...</span><span class="sentence" id="148">Uh...Actually, he had turned it in, but the Army didn't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So he had a correspondence with the army for many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so someday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We just stole it. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And there were millions of tons of supplies stashed in <span class="BUILDING">depots</span> around the <span class="REGION">area</span> and...uh...they should be used. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Couldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There were socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">There were shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There were jackets and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, we were starting a pretty good system going when orders came out moving us. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh...The British were taking over our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">There had been negotiations and most of the <span class="REGION">Rhineland</span> became British zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And in typical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plezn</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We packed up and we started across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Before that happened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I decided that I better do something in this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that needed doing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Took a 3 day pass and took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> where Abe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto himself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Uh...My reaction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">There was still 30 odd thousand Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Some were dying each day cause there was no way for them to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Most of them were going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They didn't look like they were going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said they were going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he had this fine clothing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes out of a <span class="BUILDING">German Army warehouse</span> just by going in, opening the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and taking them. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And...uh...Every day he had people to bury. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I...uh...often have said to people who are skeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off approximately how many...uh...feet of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> it takes in full directions to make a rectangle that would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Uh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">On the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the Germans didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> cause when we went into the marvelous old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yana</span> , and into the wonderful former capitol of the German Republic of Weimar, I saw smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not the...uh...crematorium fires, but the fires at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald concentration camp</span> where there were still people. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You could see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of those two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right way during those years...uh...you could smell <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> without any trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> , and I settled into my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Uh...Two things happened in fairly short order, one of which is...uh...just of historic interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The other of which transformed my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I'll do the easy one first. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I got a phone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was the Bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> , a Catholic Bishop who told me his name, which I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And I said to him, "Sir, I.. (You see he had some English)...that you want my Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun," and he said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You're the Rabbi, aren't you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I said, "Yes Sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And he said, "You're the man I want to come to see, he said, "You don't have to come out here." </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was a couple of miles from us to the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> was. "</span><span class="sentence" id="193">I am coming down this evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I'll stop in." </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I went to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I met for the first time a bishop who looked like a bishop. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">You know, the long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the whole business, and he greeted me very warmly and said that he wanted to take me somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...1t will be a great relief to one of his parishioners if I would go with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I said, "Alright," and we made a date for the next afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We went into the old part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> , which is centuries old. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">These wonderful 4 and 5 story <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> , which looked like a slum on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and are often very nice on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and I was introduced to a man named Snyder, an engineer, who told me the following story. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">In the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which he lived, a neighbor had been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , by the way, was still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We cleaned it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It had been made a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , of course, by the Germans, and it was rededicated and used by the Jews who happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It may still be used. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I have no idea. (</span><span class="sentence" id="208">Sigh) Rabbi Katz and Mr. Snyder, became very close friends because they both had an interest in French impressionist paintings, and they both collected what they could afford to collect. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">In 1938, when the Nazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, "They are going to take our pictures because they want paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They steal paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Let's hide them. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Snyder, being an engineer, was ingenious, and he took his <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> which was 40 feet long, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">One of these European saloon-type rooms, and he built a fake wall 3 feet in from the regular <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and that <span class="DLF">wall</span> was covered with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">book shelves</span> and other nice things, with one a typical <span class="DLF">spring door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He took me <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and there were all the paintings which they had stashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that, obviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings would be his...his paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">If he did not come back, all the paintings would be Snyder's. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Uh...He also left some books, and that's why the Bishop had taken me. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">His most precious books. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Rabbi Katz was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , his whole family, so there was nobody to inherit either the paintings or the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And I took the books at Snyder's request. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">An interesting group of 4, 5 books. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Not his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , just the books he cared most about. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">One 2 volume set turns out to be precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It's now in the rare <span class="INT_SPACE">book room</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It's one of two copies of this 1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classics... uh...1n the whole world. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">The other one is at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Uh...There were some German poems, beautiful edition, which I gave to Sylvia. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We'll come across Sylvia shortly, and...uh...a Hebrew New Testament, 17th Century, which I gave to the Bishop. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And...uh...for myself, I kept and sent home an album of Visidor Kaufman, a prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Visidor Kaufman was a fine classical Jewish painter of the beginning of the 20th century who was himself Austrian and got interested in East European types. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And his paintings of East European Jews and East European scenes are classics. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And...uh...I have been distributing those to friends, and I have one or two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The same day there was a knock on my <span class="DLF">door</span> and a little woman walked in, in an American Red Cross uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Uh...Sylvia was maybe 5 feet tall, a skinny little thing, very good looking, about 10 years older than I, and she told me the following story. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">She was a social worker who had been part of the social work department at Steven Wise Free Synagogue, which was then just called <span class="BUILDING">Free Synagogue</span> because Steven Wise was still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And she had worked for Wises, and told wonderful stories about Steven Wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">When <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> got into the war, he said to her, "You have to go into the Red Cross." </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And she said, "Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="240">To feed donuts to G.I.'s?" </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And he said, "Yes, because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas, and you are going to be able to help Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">There will be survivors, and they are going to need all kinds of help and you're just the type to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="243">He was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">She was just the type. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">She got into the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids who survived, and that was the transport that went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> legally...uh...after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">She landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And was the director of the Red Cross club in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Plzen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">She had four other women working with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And from early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and talked and chatted with American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Then they closed up for the night, and they opened the <span class="DLF">back door</span> and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Uh...Sylvia asked me if I wanted to help Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Since that's why I went to Europe, I agreed "Yal," and...uh...asked her what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade group which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They had been attached to the British army in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , had fought through the war, and at the end of the war were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trevisio</span> , way up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Italian Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> and they sent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> over the hills into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and they began to move Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to get on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , illegal of course, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and would I help with this enterprise? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We could send Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and the Brigade would pick them up and take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year old kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Cops and robbers! </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Actually, it was out of all of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , because at that point the <span class="DLF">border</span> between the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> was an open <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We were still friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> I wanted to go for my purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And...uh...two things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">First, Sylvia and I went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">There were 6,000 Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">Rothchild Hospital</span> there without a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and new people were coming in all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Some from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">First time I had heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Others from further East coming West because they had no intentions of living in the East. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was not a place for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Uh...They didn't want to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They didn't want to Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They didn't want to live in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They wanted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And they would come to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> hoping that somebody would have some ideas about how to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very important function. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We'll talk about that some more when we come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abe Klausner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">Rothchild Hospital</span> to...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> is only about 40 or 50 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The only way to get there is by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We then proceeded to type one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> for the purpose of looking for relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We looked around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> for the biggest stamp we could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I haven't any idea what it was about, but we found one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this thing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And...uh...We would collect them when the people came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> and then take them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> because I could travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And...uh...leave them at our <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> , <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and a new group would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We didn't want large groups taking over <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , so they came in every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And they reported to us at the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross Club</span> after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov displaced persons camp which was just on the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRRA camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I went out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, "Tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Does the C stand for Carnegie?," </span><span class="sentence" id="296">and he said, "How do you know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I said, "Because anybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that your middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And he said, "Amazing." </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I said, "Yal, So am I." And we talked and he said, "Lipman. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Lipman. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Is your old man a jeweler?" </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I said, "Yal." </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And he said, "I bought my wedding ring from him." </span><span class="sentence" id="304">His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp..</span> We used for transportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and the answer was U.S. Army trucks. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And who drove them? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">U.S. Army personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Why did they do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Scotch. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We did not want people doing us favors. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We were commercial. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Uh...We made a trip down to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> and made the discovery that the only <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danu</span> ...Australian Rivers that we knew about was a <span class="DLF">military bridge</span> and we weren't about to use that. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So we went down the <span class="DLF">road</span> looking for a way to get across that blasted <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and we found one. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It was an old <span class="DLF">dam</span> no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide enough at the top for an Army 6-pode to get across with about 6 inches of play on each <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And that's the one we used. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We went across the <span class="DLF">dam</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and found our way either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lintz</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gratz</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltsport</span> , depending on whether the Brigade told us to bring this bunch of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Others, 1t worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But I have to tell you where we got the liquor because that involves one of my more favorite memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I was entitled to a few bottles of Scotch a week as a... was a Captain by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That wasn't enough because we needed at least a dozen to 20 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Uh...One of the breaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this...Massel is not to be considered a minor thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The...uh...sergeant in charge of our <span class="DLF">motor pool</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Corps Headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Now <span class="BUILDING">Corps Headquarters</span> has a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It just does. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Uh...Corps a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Was a sergeant named Katz, and he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and Sergeant Katz and I made a deal that he would get truck drivers for me and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we would pay with money and Scotch. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">As I recall, it was 2 bottles per round trip or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But where the Hell do you get Scotch in that kind of quantity? </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And I decided to take a real risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I went to my senior chaplain, a Presbyterian from <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> , Bird Colonel, full Colonel, but not regular army. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He was a reservist. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">A very, quiet, pleasant man. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He said to me, "You know, I haven't asked you any questions, but you travel a lot more than is comfortable for the Chief of Staff." </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Cause I was going to all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camps</span> and communities and people I could find all over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I was also going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We haven't come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And he said...uh...Chief of Staff has asked...has asked me about this and I said I would investigate it." </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He said, "I can cover for you if I know where you are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And you haven't any reason to tell me where you are going, but you will have to or I can't cover for you with the Chief of Staff," who is after all a 2-star General. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I'll make a deal with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">When I leave each day, I will put under your blotter a statement of where I am going, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> each day, and then I'll give you my trip ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And you validate it if you chose to do so." </span><span class="sentence" id="344">He said, "Of course, I chose to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I know what you're doing and you got to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He did not know that we were taking Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , but he knew I was working with Jewish displaced persons and he thought that was absolutely essential. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Bless him, said I. He says, "Anything else I can do for you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I said, "Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">You're a Bird Colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">You get all the liquor you want, don't you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He said, "I wouldn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I don't drink." </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I said, "I knew that, but you're about to." </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And he listened and he said a couple of people in supply are going to be awfully (laughing) surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I said, "You don't have to explain what you're doing with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It's for charitable purposes that you getting into Protestant charities in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> which is your bound duty as a Christian." </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And he smiled and he thought that made sense, and I got all the liquor I wanted from then on, on his tab. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Bless his heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I was...I heard of his death in the early 50s, and I was very sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He was a good, good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He saved my life, and saved Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">That operation worked very well until August when...uh...we got caught in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austria towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Red handed! </span><span class="sentence" id="364">The whole bunch of us! </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We had not yet transferred these people to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> ...uh...and we got picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And I got terrible reaming from a General who announced me that he was going to radio my General immediately, and I would be court-martialed. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">General Hubner, who was known as the little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">He didn't want Jews in his <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only displaced persons who were difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">All other displaced persons, and there were 20 some nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the Germans imported for labor purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They were grateful for being alive, for being fed by <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were no hurry to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The Jews were not grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">The Jews were in terrible conflict over being alive, over having survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they wanted out, and nobody would let them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And so they caused more trouble than everybody else put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Some of us understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">We tried to organize it so that it wasn't too difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that we always have. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was was in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think that should be understandable that they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">So General Hubnere said, "Get them out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I don't care." </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">One incident will illustrate this. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">He called Sylvia and me in one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Now I had never met General Hubner. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Uh...Captains don't monkey around much with 3-star generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">There are layers of bureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cross women don't have a lot to do with Generals, though Sylvia had had more to do with Hubner than most because she was always making demands. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Sylvia was a tough, tough lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And Sylvia told the General...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to monkey with the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">He needed the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Those donuts were very precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Donuts and coffee kept American troops going. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Uh...He called us in and said, "I hear there is going to be a Jewish meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to talk about the future of all these Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And we said, "Yep." </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And he said, "You're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">You go my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">When does the meeting start?" </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And we told and he said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Two days before that, get out there and tell them for me to get all these Jews out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They should do everything they can do to get them out fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It's not good for them and it is not good for us either." </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And he said it not unkindly, but he wasn't smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And Sylvia and I flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to the special Zionist Congress that was called in July in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , the chief purpose of which was to set the course that would lead to...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 's independence 3 years later, which meant that Ben-Gurion had a fight with Wietzman and Ben-Gurion wiped up the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with Wietzman in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which, for me, is pretty unforgettable. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Uh...What did he say? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He did what Ben-Gurion always did. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first to tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way up. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Sometimes I felt like he was going it minute by minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Four hours was not his longest speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Uh...He has made longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And then rehearsing the Zionist movement from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belu</span> all the way up...uh...and then minute by minute the events of World War II, subjectively stated so that Wietzman looked like an idiot who played the British and he was the savior who was going to see to it that we had a Jewish State. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And they believed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And Wietzman was really not in condition to do a proper answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Wietzman aged 10 years in 5 days, and he became the old man, the inevitable person to the first President of the State. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Powerless and ceremonial. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">That's what Wietzman became as of that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Ben- Gurion became the leader of the Zionist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Uh...Sylvia and I did not spend much time in sessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We spent our time meeting people that Steven Wise told us to meet to tell them about <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to tell them about displaced persons, to tell them about the Haganah, and to urge certain kinds of support, none of which we had yet gotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I met some fascinating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Uh...I discovered this Lord Reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Rufus Isaacs had gout, and that Lady Reading was really a lady and as passionate about...uh...Jewish things as any convert could be and...uh...all the leaders of the Zionist movement wanted to hear from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">We were the only people there from the <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That is, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Nobody else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Because nobody could get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It never occurred to them for some reason or other to send some displaced persons over to tell the thing first person. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">There wasn't a single one there. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So we were busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And the General made that possible because that's how he wanted to get rid of the Jews. (</span><span class="sentence" id="433">Laughter) Benevolently! </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So he did not court martial me. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He called me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Actually, it was the Chief Staff who called me in and said, "We got this TWX from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="437">Yes, Sir." "</span><span class="sentence" id="438">What the Hell have you been up to?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="439">TWX tells you what I have been up to." "</span><span class="sentence" id="440">We can't allow this." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I said, "No, I suppose not. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">What'll you do." </span><span class="sentence" id="443">He said, "We're moving you so you can't do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Alright, that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Sylvia could keep the thing going and then other people took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So far as I know some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> continued to go until the communists took over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  When I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> the first time, I discovered there had been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , or as the Czechs call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , north and a little bit west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">There was still 16,000 Jews there with a Russian unit...uh...running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp because</span> it was in a <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was exactly what...uh...all the pictures have ever shown it to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was an <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> ...uh...and wasn't bad, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , I remind you, was the show-off <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">That was the place that the Red Cross came to. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">The International Red Cross was not exactly heroic during World War II, but they would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and make inspection...inspections and then send out a report saying the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They had a band and gave concerts and they had classes and they did all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">What they didn't say is that everyday transports left for the east and that none of those people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Leo Beck had survived by accident, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">There was somebody else named Beck in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they got mixed up and they sent that Beck off to East instead of Leo Beck. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Leo Beck had left by the time I got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The Russians had flown him into the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , and the British had flown him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where his only child, a daughter, lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And...uh...We proceeded, the Russian and I, to make a very simple deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He wanted to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We wanted to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="473"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> had agreed that they would take this people to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Begendorf</span> in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It was just a case of getting them there, and I had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So we made a deal to move all the Jews out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Begendorf</span> and here I have to tell you another one of those absolutely uncanny coincidences. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">All of our conferences, the camp commander and I, took place in the presence of a third person wearing a plain uniform who was the Commissar, the political leader, and he ran things. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">He sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Fortunately, he knew virtually no German. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">The only language the Commander and I had in common was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Mine was fairly bad, and his was even worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So we were talking German to each other, making ourselves understood and then I heard a word in a sentence that this man was saying, which was not German. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It was a Yiddish word with a Hebrew origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Aw, said I, He has just sent me a signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So in my next paragraph, I carefully used a Yiddish word that had a Hebrew origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Neither of us blinked an eye lash, but we both knew why he was going to work his head off to get those Jews out of there and he wanted me to know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Never again in the whole time I was there...those...almost 3 months did he allude to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We were never alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">The Commissar never let us alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">If I went there for lunch, the Commissar had lunch with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He was with us every minute that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Came the last day. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">The last transport leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dagendorf</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> all lined up, my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> ready, my driver excited, Vic, and...uh...suddenly was a scream toward the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , somebody yelling "Halt." </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And a woman, I remember her, a kind of heavy set lady climbed out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and started to run toward one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So we followed her, the Camp President and I. She went into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">She went down some <span class="DLF">steps</span> , around corners, down some more <span class="DLF">steps</span> , way down into the bowels of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> , and came to a...what looked like a piece of metal covering the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , only it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It was a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And when we went through that <span class="DLF">door</span> , we were in the <span class="BUILDING">Theresienstadt synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And...uh...1t had not been completely cleaned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">There were some things there, and we took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">One of the things was a Megillah, of Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And they wanted to give it to me, and I said, "No, that I thought it belonged to Leo Beck." </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Whether or not it was his, it should be his. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They all agreed that was so. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He was a hero in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> by the way, because he had organized all those classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He had insisted after pulling his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage truck</span> all day that you could not let your mind go to waste, and he had organized what amounted to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Anybody who could teach anything taught it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And he taught it. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And that was...uh...accepted by these people as terribly important. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And so he was...there have...there has been some statements about Beck's status in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as being something less than heroic, but not in my conversations with people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They really respected this old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So I said I would take it to him, that one way or another eventually I would be going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> or I'd send it or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So when I went to the Zionist Congress in July, I took the Megillah with me, wrapped in a piece of plastic, and I called, spoke to his daughter and made an appointment to see him on a particular day I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">When I arrived, I was taken through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the <span class="DLF">back garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was a little back British gardens which are so nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And...uh...Leo Beck was a bit of a ham, and my later experiences with him confirmed the fact that he was a bit of a ham. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He was sitting...uh... reading something in profile. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He had a marvelous profile, and the sun was shining directly on to him. (</span><span class="sentence" id="519">Laughter) And we talked for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I had to give him condolences. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">His niece...uh...had been killed in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> accident on the way out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , the only on toward thing that we had in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Theresienstadt transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> slid into the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and she was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">His great niece was okay though. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Her daughter! </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And we talked about that for awhile, and this young lady's future and I gave him the Megillahe. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And he looked at it, and he looked at it, and he said, "I don't want this." </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I said, "Why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The people wanted you to have it." </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">If I have it, it's a museum piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The Megillah should not be a museum piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It should be a living document. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It should be read. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">It should be read by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">This one being the Theresienstadt Magila should be read under circumstances which connect the story of the Megillah with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">You take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Only you promise me that that's how it will be used." </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And I took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I had a box made for it by a Holocaust survivor when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Actually, I didn't have it made until I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And a woman named Friedal Blumenthal, a superb silversmith, made this box. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The box 1s teac and she has ornamented it with appropriate symbols and the fact that it's a Megillah of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresien</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It is now going into its second generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">When I retired, I gave it to my son who happens to be a Rabbi, and he uses it in his congregation and he has made a...an arrangement with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> that it will be on display here for part of each year. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">That's my first meeting with Leo Beck. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Later, he taught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> in 1948, and from 1948 until his death in 55, I think it was, he taught one semester each year at the <span class="BUILDING">college institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> and the rest of the year was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where he lead the World Union For Progressive Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">First rate lecturer and a bit of a ham. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Uh...Now where do we go from here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  What I want to do from here is to go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Uh...I want to...I do not yet want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Uh...And I would like to know... You worked so closely with the Haganah, and you worked with Berichah. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I would like for you to talk a little bit about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Uh...Tell us who you worked with and what those relationships were like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Okay, then I'll have to talk about the girls too.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  The people I worked with were primarily my American truck drivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Andy Dunn and Faye Green at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Karlof</span> ...uh...1 don't remember the names of anybody from the <span class="BUILDING">Rothchild Hospital</span> , but there was an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there in which these documents...uh...which we did about 4 or 5 hundred eventually, these one-page things with the red stamp, that ...uh...got these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They never had trouble getting from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Even after the...uh...cold war was declared, and I had to go back <span class="DLF">roads</span> my last couple of trips to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I could not just go across. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I had to go through a <span class="DLF">back road</span> that I found to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresin</span> and then I could get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and then I had to go back to my <span class="DLF">road</span> to get back into the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> because the Russians would no longer let us travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">My 3“language pass was no longer acceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Even after that, United Nations displaced persons traveling from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> for the purpose of looking for relatives had no trouble getting through the <span class="DLF">border crossing</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brockisoni</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So I don't remember names very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I remember nobody from the Jewish Brigade group. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Sylvia had made contact with a man named, who had been a Captain in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> , and , an attorney and I heard of him subsequent over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I never met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So I had no dealings directly with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I dealt with whoever happened to come across with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or the combination that was taking our people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> across to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It was pretty much a...uh...two-person operation, Sylvia and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Sylvia worked day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">She was absolutely incredible in that Red Cross thing of hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Her four people, the other women knew exactly what was going on, and they helped as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They were nice, healthy American kids who...uh...got a little bit bored listening to G.I. stories from 9 o'clock to 9 o'clock and handing out donuts and coffee, which is all Red Cross...un...canteens served. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They got tired making those donuts too. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So...uh...I didn't have a great many...uh....Berichah contacts then. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Later it...uh...1t changed drastically. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But, the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> thing was pretty much as I have described it. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Uh...One ...uh...group of people I really have to mention because they become so important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Shortly after we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , I kept hearing about <span class="NPIP">places</span> where there were Jews and that's why the Chaplain had such trouble with my trip tickets because I went to all these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And incidentally managed to show up at all the <span class="BUILDING">American Headquarters</span> I was supposed to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the southern part of ... And I heard that there some Jewish girls there. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Women! </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And I went down there, and sure enough, there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Nearly 400 of them in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">They had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the Germans who were really suicidal about Jews had put these women...more than 400, nearly a thousand.... on to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and sent the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> east. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Toward the end of the war, they did that with a lot of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Their minds, I think, going like...we don't want the Americans to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">It will be better for us if the Americans don't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">These women got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suchita</span> when they couldn't get any more fuel for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So the engineer abandoned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and there they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Somebody opened it up because they heard screams presumably, and they buried the dead and put the rest of them into this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I went there and met these women. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">They wanted a service, so we had services, after which one young woman came up to me, introduced herself in quite good English, told me that she and her three sisters and three of their friends, all from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , had been together through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Turns out that she mama'd this group and saved them through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And...uh...they wanted to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Was there any <span class="NPIP">place</span> they could live? </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Because she had been offered a job with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , and one of the others was going to this, one of the others was going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They all had plans for living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suchison</span> , so we got them a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And...uh...they became my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Uh...The word kid is funny because Erna is really only about 5 years younger than I am, and the man she married was older than I. But...uh... They're my kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">A little later...uh...the job situation was such that they would do better in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavarian town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tishinroit</span> , so they were moved to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tishinroit</span> , where they lived until they came to...well, 1946, Bronya, now Betty, married Henry and they moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> where his only living relative was, and they are still there and we still correspond. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I have not seen them since 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Uh...Dora, who was the housekeeper....she was the domesticated one of this crowd...married Borrof, and they disappeared in the wilds of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , where he is a Hasid and does not permit his wife to have much to do with the rest of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But Dora manages to call Erna periodically to make sure everybody is alright and to send her love. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">The other five have been together constantly ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They all came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They all married. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Two of them...three of them married in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I officiated at all three marriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And...uh...some of the kids were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirsenroit</span> , including a pair of twins, who are now both M.D., Ph.</span><span class="sentence" id="615">Ds doing extraordinary work. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Uh...They've remained my family to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Uh...Interestingly enough, the one who was not their sister...uh...married their uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They had a very uncle, and Maguska married him. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So we've been through a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Births, Bar Mitzvah and a couple of deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Remarkably few deaths, I am glad to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And we are still in routine communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Uh...Erna's marriage was rather miraculous because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , she had met a woman who had said to her that she was absolutely perfect as a mate for her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And after the war she married that son, a physician who had a successful practice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">The coincidences are such. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Anyhow, that's my ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Uh...We are still in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and you said there was a story that you wanted to tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Not everything that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> (clearing throat) or anywhere else was upbeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">There were problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">There were tragedies and there were horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Uh...I'll tell you a horror story just because it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlov camp</span> was our salvation, but there were problems there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">One middle of the night, I got a frantic call from Andy Dunn to come out immediately, so I went over to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It seems...uh...a Kapo had turned up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="637">A Kapo was a Jew who worked for the Germans or Poles in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and if the Jews hated anybody more than they hated Germans and Poles and other people, they hated Kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Somebody recognized this Kapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlov</span> that night, and they had killed him and they just tossed his body over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the body had been found. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And poor Andy didn't know what to do with a dead Kapo, and that was understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And...uh...It seemed to me that to inform the Czech authorities was a bad idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So we just buried the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And...uh...he, like many other Jews, lies in an unmarked <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">My own feelings that night made that one of the low points of the entire 3 year experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Uh...It's not my only Kapo experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We had another one, but...that Jews could kill somebody, another Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">No matter how terrible the other Jew was, with no due process of any kind, outraged me and upset me and scared me. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">But...uh..1t was another lesson to be learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Let's go from that to a birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">A woman came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sylvia</span> , Hungarian Jewish girl who was very pregnant and who didn't want the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">The father of the baby was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Following liberation she had met a man, a Hungarian, who wanted to marry her, only he wouldn't marry her with the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It didn't bother him that she was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">After all, she had nothing to do with that really, but...uh... he wasn't going to raise that child and neither was she. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">What should we do with this baby about to be born? </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Sylvia said, "Give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I will somehow get it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I have a sister who does not have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">That will be her child." </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And on June 1...July 1...July 1, 1945, this baby was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">A little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And the doctor who delivered her, I remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Interestingly enough his son, who was very young at the time, became my friend because of this incident and the son died in <span class="REGION">California</span> just about 2 weeks ago to my sorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Uh...Here was this baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">The mother agreed that she would keep the child until she was ready to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Five days later she came into the <span class="BUILDING">club</span> after 10 o'clock one night and said, "I can't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I have no interest in this baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Why should I waste time looking after this kid? </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Here." </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And handed a baby to Sylvia. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Sylvia and four Red Cross girls found themselves the mother of a 5 day old baby, and I became it's sort of surrogate father. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The child lived in the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross Club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">The five women took care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">The...uh...story of how we found... Well, bottles were easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Coke bottles worked fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">You sterilize a coke bottle, and we had lots of coke bottles around. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Nipples were harder to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">It took almost a whole day of tearing around <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> until we found one nipple for this kid that would fit a coke bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">That's part of the problem. (</span><span class="sentence" id="679">Laughter) It was big enough for a calf as a matter of fact, but the baby thrived on it which is what mattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">We had no trouble with the other necessities for a young baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And then in very dramatic fashion...uh...Sylvia had to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on emergency in the summer of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Her father was desperately sick and did, in fact, die. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So she got emergency leave to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she packed up the baby in a bed roll and took her along with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">When she got to <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Transatlantic plane</span> they wanted...uh...baby's not on the manifest. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And Sylvia said, "Who puts 2 month old babies on a manifest?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="686">Where did you get the child." "</span><span class="sentence" id="687">It's my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I had a baby." </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And she bluffed her way through immigration into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And her sister got the child and the child is, I understand, very healthy and alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We changed her birthdate. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">On the birth certificate, which...uh...happened under extreme circumstances also, it must have been...oh...a year later, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">No....a year and a half later, I got a frantic letter from the child's mother saying, "We're trying to complete the adoption and the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> will not put through the adoption without a birth certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Get me a birth certificate." </span><span class="sentence" id="695">The communist had taken over in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and I wasn't about to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> trying to get a birth certification. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">So I went to my Commanding Officer and I said to him, "Colonel, is it true that all camp commanders and post commanders are notaries." "</span><span class="sentence" id="697">Yes." "</span><span class="sentence" id="698">Would you notarize a document for me?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="699">Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So in my name, I wrote a statement about the circumstances of this child's birth, never alluding to the child's name or mother because I wasn't going to lie...uh...not in a sworn affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I'm a funny American...uh...in view of the stories I am telling you, it sounds strange that I would lie in an affidavit, but I didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So I wrote it very carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Told the circumstances of the child's birth and the movement to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and...uh...civil affairs were not exactly in order Plzen in July of 1945 and there was no birth certificate, and would the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> please accept this sworn affidavit in lieu of a birth certificate, and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And so the adoption was completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Uh...That's one of my nice stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I hope you can get to Sylvia to get the rest of it because she tells it beautifully and I don't want to tell more because the young lady is around. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">The young lady and I have no contact whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I have not tried to keep these kinds of contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Let's now go to the USO. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">We'll finish up <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">USO tours were very important, especially during the occupation period. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">American soldiers were bored, and these entertainers came and...uh...you know, you've seen television pictures of Bob Hope and the crowd he gets. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Well, every group that came over, no matter how mediocre got this kind of reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I was called in by our special services officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> and asked if I could do them a favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I said, "What do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He said, "Well, we have a strange USO group coming over. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">They have let it be known that they will not under any circumstances do the job they're being sent here to do, namely to entertain American troops, unless they can also go to Jewish displaced persons groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And they're important people. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So I want to indulge them. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Can you help me." </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I said, "Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I can help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I can make arrangement for concerts and appearances in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camps</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="725">Alright, they are arriving day after tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">WIII you meet them at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="727">Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And I walked into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which contained, and now I am name dropping, the only time I shall do this I hope, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Benny, Larry Addler, the world's greatest harmonica player and Martha Tilton of whom I had never heard till then, but who turns out to be a very good pop singer. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And...uh...they said to me that they wanted to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I said, "What do you want to do for these Jews?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="731">Leave that up to us." </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And I took them in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">command car</span> for one solid week during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">After all American troops could not be entertained...until 11:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the afternoon, they were supposed to be working. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">But Jews were sitting around. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They spent their days entertaining Jews, and their evenings entertaining American troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And they were magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">They were absolutely superb. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Jack Benny's Yiddish was quite good. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Larry Addler's Yiddish was quite good. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Uh...Ingrid Bergman talked to them 1n a broken kind of German which she broke deliberately so they wouldn't think it was Yiddish, and (laughter) they knew it wasn't and...uh...I[ had a wonderful time for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I was...uh...the only spectator at about | o'clock one morning to a recital in which Jack Benny played the piano and Larry Addler played the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I wish I had a tape of that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I wish the world had a tape of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">It was a really spectacular experience, and I developed enormous regard for those four people because they really knocked themselves out for these Jews.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I was...uh...assigned to the 4th Armored Division, one of its combat commands. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">In those days a armored division consisted of three combat commands. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I was assigned to one of them in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And...uh...1t didn't take long to find Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">There were 2,000 of them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , not under UNRRA auspices, which means they needed everything in the world and we had to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">One of the things we got them was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It had an <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">It had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> cause they organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Two thousand Jews are either organized or you have chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">One or the other! </span><span class="sentence" id="761">By this time, incidentally, it's the very end of August 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And I was very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">We had inadequate food for these people and no money to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I had written to the JVC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , trying to get money and we could buy food, and...uh...was told no, this was not the way they wanted to do business, that they would be coming in with their people and they would take care of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Meanwhile, we had hungry Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Uh...I guess the first thing to tell you 1s the meeting of Chaplains, which happened shortly after I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> or... I am going to call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">It was really a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span

with the Chair of the Commission of Army and Navy Chaplaincy of the Jewish Welfare Board of the late Rabbi Joseph Lipstein, an orthodox rabbi, and with Rabbi who was a director of that commission, who

know where else. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">But he met us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and that was the first time I had seen Klausner...uh...since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> because I had just gotten back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and had not had a chance to go down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And...uh...I'll never forget Lipstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">He greeted us and he said, "Now Gentlemen, my report to the Jewish Welfare Board on Chaplain activities, I wrote on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> coming over. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">It was easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Now I want to know, and if you trust me, don't hold back. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Tell me what's going on." </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And we looked at one another, and we decided we'd tell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So we told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We had lots of problems, and nothing to deal with them with. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Uh...Abe was the most outspoken and said the most because he had the most experience by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I should tell you that by then, you see, he had organized the Central Committee of Displaced Persons in the <span class="REGION">U.S. zone</span> of which he was the president. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And he had departments set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">They were doing health work. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">They were getting food and clothing where they could scrounge it, and I guess most of important of all, they were doing a relative search. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Uh...Abe published five volumes of names of survivors which sat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> in the old <span class="BUILDING">Dorchus museum</span> which was his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> then and on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...I wish we had pictures of it...I think he does...are the names of thousands of Jews and where to find them so they could find relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And relatives were found this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It was a very inefficient way, but it was the only way we had so we used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And...uh.. during that meeting with Lipstein not participating, the chaplains decided that our people had a right to clothing, and they weren't getting it and there was no indication that when JDC or anybody else would come in to give people clothing who weren't in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And even in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> they didn't have clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They particularly didn't have clothing for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Our people were beginning to have kids if you can count. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And...uh...we decided we would use a technique which was legal which the Army permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">You in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> could send to any soldier anywhere in the world a 11-pound package of food and or clothing...uh...to his A.P.O. number, and you could send as many as you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So each of us wrote letters, and we sent them to everybody we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I sent them to every Rabbi I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I sent them to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I have a large family, and all my friends and everybody else I could think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Send packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And God helps us, they began to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Tons. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">By the end of October 1945, I had 80 people working full time in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> on just the stuff addressed to me, sorting this clothing, throwing away some of it I am sorry to say or using it for smotas and fixing that which was repairable and getting it cleaned and once a week I visited all of the 31 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> in my part of <span class="REGION">north Bavaria</span> delivering sacks of this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I began to worry about my <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So I went to my postal officer and I said, "People in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> are sending me a lot of stuff as you know." </span><span class="sentence" id="806">He said, "Yes, Chaplain, I am aware of it." </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I said, "How about it if I make it easy on you and I send a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> down here everyday to pick up the stuff so you don't have to deliver it." "</span><span class="sentence" id="808">Oh, that will be wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Thank you." </span><span class="sentence" id="810">He didn't ask a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I didn't give him any information. (</span><span class="sentence" id="812">laughing) I just sent the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and we got our stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Absolutely incredible quantities. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Tons and tons of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Now people began to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">We give contributions to the Joint Distribution Committee which is supposed to be doing relief work all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">How come we get asked by the Rabbis for these packages? </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And that must have been....must have been embarrassing to JDC but by that time, I am afraid we weren't very sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Uh...When they came in, they came into my <span class="REGION">territory</span> ...uh...no...they came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munch</span> in August...three social workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Not carrying a stitch of anything with them, and no budget for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Klausner got them him a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">As he had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and he brought them into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and that became their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> cause they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">They were credited to <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , but <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> didn't supply them with anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">It wasn't <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> 's job. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">It was their job to be supplying. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">These people were absolutely unprepared for what they were going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">They didn't know anything about relative search. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">They didn't know anything about getting people out, if you could get people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They had not been trained. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Of course, neither had we. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">One of the astounding facts of my life is that those of us who went to Europe got absolutely no orientation from anybody about what we were going to find when we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Not from the JWB, which...whose job it wasn't, but not from the other agencies either who really might have gotten a hold of us before we left and said, "Hey, you're going to run into A, B, C. and D, and contact so and so and so and so, and at least know the address of the <span class="BUILDING">JDC office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> which none of us had. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So...uh...those relationships...uh... were either strained or good, depending on the personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Two of the three people who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> were magnificent as people. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Ceil Wineburg, I shall always...married a man...uh...died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , was superb. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And she wouldn't leave Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">She got so attached to those people and their needs that she must have stayed 5 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Uh...The other one, a girl named Debbie, I am sorry to say died in Europe...uh...a defective <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">heating stove</span> ...uh...in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">This happened in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  Another thing we had to do...
QUESTION:  Tell me more about JDC and this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">ANSWER:  (Sigh) Well, I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">In late October, early November, there came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , a full time JDC person named Joe Levine, who now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Wayne</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , deeply devoted, cared about these people and did everything in the world that could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">He even learned how to scrounge, and he learned how to steal, and he learned how to send for this and that not through JDC channels, and eventually JDC managed to get stuff in. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I mean it didn't stay this way forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">But those...that first year was pretty horrendous and Joe was as frustrated as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Fortunately, we became very close friends and we were on the same wave length from beginning to end. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">We are still good friends, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">High Holidays, 1945, I must tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Not only for soldiers, but for displaced persons as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I decided that they were decided...that they were entitled to have a break fast at the end of Yom Kippur which would be traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">What do you need for a break fast? </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">You gotta have herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Without herring you can't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">How do you get herring? </span><span class="sentence" id="859">There's no herring in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Legal, illegal, no herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So I cabled military to a Chaplain friend in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and said, I need a big barrel of salt herring, enough for 2,000 people for break fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">One day in August...late August, 1945, beginning September, I don't remember the dates at this point, I got a phone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="863"><span class="DLF">Munich airstrip</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="864">Are you Chaplain Lipman?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="865">At the end of our <span class="DLF">runway</span> is the biggest God Dam barrel (you'll have to censor that) I have seen and it stinks." "</span><span class="sentence" id="866">I'll be right down." (</span><span class="sentence" id="867">Laughter) I put my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> , and I went to the <span class="DLF">air strip</span> and we unloaded what was an enormous barrel. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">You think of a barrel as this big. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">It was three times that big. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Was almost as tall as I. We couldn't lift it. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">It had to be rolled. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And I took it up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ragensberg</span> , and said, "Now what do I do with it? </span><span class="sentence" id="873">How do I make this into pickled herring, because it was old salt herring, in brine, untouched. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">It had its heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It had had its scales. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">It had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Then I got an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">My commanding officer was a Colonel Koen. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">We were not friends, I am sorry to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">He should rest in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Harold Kone was not very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">He was part of the famous teams of Abrahams in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">The 4th Armored Division had been <span class="NPIP">hell</span> on wheels for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They had hated the 4th Armored, and they particularly Abrahams and Koen. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">They thought they were both Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Abrahams was the late General Kritein, Abrahams of Viet Nam fame who was then a Colonel, and was Harold Koen's commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">He commanded the combat command. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Harold...No, he commanded the regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Harold had the combat command. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Harold Koen taught Kreitein Abrahams some Yiddish and to the extent they could on their walky talkies, they talked Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And the Germans called them terrible names, these two Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">But that was as Jewish as Harold Koen got. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">He was not interested in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">He was not interested in what I was doing, and so we kept away from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I went in to him and I said, "Harold, I need something, and maybe this will appeal to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I need some PWs, a bunch of them for a whole day." "</span><span class="sentence" id="897">What for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I said, "To clean herring." </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And he said, "What?" </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I said, "Yal, I got a barrel of herring here, a big barrel for both our troops and for the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> for Yom Kippur." </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And he said, "Oh, how beautiful." </span><span class="sentence" id="902">We had a PW cage for high ranking officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">He gave me 10 Colonels, 10 Nazi Colonels, who arrived in step in uniform, and I said to them, "Gentlemen, I suggest to you that you take off as much of your uniforms as you can because the task you have is not going to be exactly..." "We are forbidden to do menial labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">We are officers." </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I said, "I am aware of that, and we will keep the Geneva Convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We will not smash it. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">We may bend it a bit before the day is over." </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I sat them down on relatively low <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stools</span> with big buckets in front of them, put the barrel of herring in front of them, and said, "Gentlemen, you are to cut off the heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">You are scale it. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">You are to gut it. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And then put it into these buckets of water." </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And I said, "Here's the written order from Colonel Koen. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I am not sure what you can do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">You are, after all, prisoners of war." </span><span class="sentence" id="916">They sat down and they spent 10 hours...it was a pretty hot day...cleaning herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I loved every minute of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I was a sadistic so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Koen must have come out 10 times to watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">He had a marvelous time that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And then when they went back...uh...the herring having been cleaned, they demanded <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And the camp commander said, "But it's not your bath day. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">You'll get your bath day on your bath day." </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And so these guys walked around reeking of herring for I don't know how many days until their bath day came, and I must tell you I had no compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I confess that I am not that human, or humane. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So we made enormous quantities of pickled herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I found some other things that the commissary or the... our supply group was willing to let me steal and then I got 4,000 donuts from our Red Cross people. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Had lots and lots and lots of coffee and all the rest of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And then I got a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">The 4th Armored Division was a New York Division and organized at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Pine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And of its 10,000 people when it was full strength, almost 15 hundred were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">It had the highest casualty rates in Jews of any unit in the United States Army I suspect because 4th Armored had been through very heavy combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the high point men got their orders to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I had over a thousand men at Rosh Hashanah services. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I had 80 at Yom Kippur services. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">They had left me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="937">Laughter) They had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I was delighted for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I was delighted for another reason too. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I had that much more food for my DPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We finished early. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I deliberately started services early and finished early, so we could all get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And all these guys that wanted to go...some of them drove <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> for me...had this food all loaded and we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> and we parked our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> in front of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Center</span> where the Jews were dining. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And...uh...somebody looked in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">They didn't know I was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I had not told them we were bringing a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And I am not sure they ever finished the meal that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">They unloaded those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> faster than I have ever seen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> unloaded, and that food disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I stood in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I had such a wonderful time watching these people break fast as you're supposed to break fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">It was a quite memorable experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Lots of other adventures in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> .,...</span><span class="sentence" id="953">uh...including my second kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I came into the center one day, and they were screaming and yelling at this poor, bedraggled looking Jew who was a kapo, and I said, "You are not going to do anything in this center." </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And we asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">The guy admitted that he had been a kapo, so we had no trouble with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And I said to the Jews, "Was being a kapo a war crime?"

class="sentence" id="1009">And I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Joe and I had a lot of things going, 31 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and communities...uh...the package system is working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">I'll have to tell you about the mail system which was also working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I didn't really want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And my Senior Chaplain said, "Gene, go." </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I said, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">He said, "You're too tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">You don't look good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Just don't like the way you look." </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And Si Pava said, "You're pain a neck these days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">You're irritable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">You're terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">said, '"Pava, you just want to go to <span

class="sentence" id="1025">And I said, "Pava, you've earned the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Let's go." </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">So we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Snowed the whole bloody way across Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">There was no other way to go and...uh...1t was not exactly a happy, happy ride, but we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And one of the most frigid experiences of my entire life was that service at the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Not the atmosphere, but it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">There was no heat in this <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">We were all sitting there in our gray coats, and Ben Gurion hung a on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">He made a long, long speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I had been instructed by my Berichah people to see Ruth Kluger in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">Haganah office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Haganah had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1038"><span class="BUILDING">European headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">So I wondered in there, and we were talking, Ruth and I, about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and what we needed and how we could do a better job of moving Jews when her phone rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And from the conversation at my...at our end, it was clear that she was talking to Judge Simon Riskin who had arrived...I don't remember how many weeks earlier...as the advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish Affairs, with a rank of Lieutenant General. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And they were talking about a deal which Ben Guron had made with Eisenhower just before Ben Guron came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">The deal in which teachers would be sent from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> to teach Hebrew, to teach agronomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">All of those teachers would be Haganah people, and the Army would try to turn its back to the maximum possible extent to let them operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Eisenhower asked one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">You will not bribe any American soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">You will not corrupt my men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I'll help you get around them, but you're not going through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And Ben-Gurion thought that made good sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So they wanted to get going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">The Army had an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> ready to go to...uh...what is now <span class="BUILDING">Ben Guron airport</span> , then called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luds</span> to pick up the first group to bring them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And it suddenly occurred to Judge Riskin that an American crew flying into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lud</span> wouldn't know what to do with itself when it got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">That some liaison person was necessary, and Ruth agreed that a liaison person was necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And she looked at me and suddenly she said to Judge Riskin, "I think I have the person sitting right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Shall I put him on the phone." </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And I introduced myself and Judge Riskine said, "If Ruth thinks you're the person to do this, then it's alright with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Can you be here tomorrow morning?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">I said, "If I drive all night, I can." </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">He said, "So drive all night." </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Lieutenant Generals are like this, and Simon Riskin is like this too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">He's a very blunt...uh...guy who had given up a <span class="NPIP">place</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Federal District bench</span> , a life appointment, to take on this temporary thing, to work for Eisenhower and do Jewish things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">He was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">So I found Si with no trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">We had a terrible time finding our other driver who was carousing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , but we caught up with him and we loaded him in the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> because he couldn't drive and the two of us drove all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">We reported to Judge Riskin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Uh...the morning following that, I was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17</span> , with a crew of five Americans heading for... Uh...Bewildered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I had my orders from General Walter Bedel Smith, and they were for 7 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So I got into Delist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and discovered nothing was ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Uh...Our Israel friends will all forgive me, but the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> is not exactly the most efficient <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the world to do business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Not then and not now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Uh...I went to meetings and tried to get things going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">There was no way to get those people out in 7 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">But I got a lot of questions that had to be answered in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So we flew back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , went into conference with the various people at <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> that were going to deal with this thing and...uh...got answers and flew back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I made two trips in about 2 weeks I guess it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">My second trip was not long before Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And...uh...while we were getting my 14 people organized, a couple of incidents are worth mentioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">First, my 7 day orders, the 7th day was a Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">It was alright with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I was under military orders and you do things under military orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">But 4 of my 14 teachers so-called were orthodox Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">They refused to fly on Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And I said, "What will give you permission to fly on Shabbat?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And they said, "Written authorization from the Chief Rabbi." </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">So I called the Chief Rabbi's office and I talked with a gentleman who is now the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the Chief Rabbi's son, who was then his secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I told him what I wanted and he laughed and he said, "All of us are gonna have fun with that one." </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And...uh...he invited me for Shebot dinner and I didn't accept because I was having Shabbat dinner with the men who was really the political head of the Haganah, the first foreign minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , who I am delighted to say became Esther's and my very good friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Uh...We loved him dearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And I remember President Hertzog saying, isn't going to like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">You don't turn down an invitation to the Rabbi's dish." </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And I said, "One is also not rude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">One has to have . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And I had accepted another invitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Now would the Chief Rabbi call Sharet and give him reasons for me not to go to <span class="BUILDING">Sharet's</span> for Shabbat dinner?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">He said, "No, the Chief Rabbi will not do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I said, "Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">You'll give my apologies to the Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I have no choice whatsoever." </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">But I went there late Friday afternoon, and the Rabbi's little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and had an interview with him before . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">His first question to me...he spoke Hebrew and English and Yiddish with an Irish accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">He had been Chief Rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dublin</span> before he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Charming, wonderful little man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">His first question to me was, "Is it true that you are Morris Neman's nephew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And I said, "How did you ever hear of Morris Neman?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And he said, "We know things out here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I said, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I am his nephew." </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And he said, "You can't be all bad, even if you're a reform Rabbi." </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">I said, "Thank you for nothing." (</span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Laughter) He gave me the piece of paper authorizing these guys to go on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> it was . </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Human life was involved, and they had to fly out on Shabbat or not fly out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I would have to go without because I wasn't going to get court martialed for this bunch or anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">So we left on Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Chief Rabbi was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I was carrying with me not only 14 somewhat scared Jews, but the most peculiar package I have ever carried in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I had been called and asked to come and see aman named Caplan, who was the treasurer of the Jewish Agency, First Minister of Finance, with the Government of Israel in 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I walked into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">This was before my meeting with the Chief Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And he said, "Are you really Morris Neman's nephew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I said, "Yes," and he offered me condolences because as it happens Morris had died in September of 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">One of the first things I did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> was go to the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and say kottish for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">He was a great Zionist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">A magnificent, magnificent man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">My favorite uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So he said, "Okay, then I'll trust you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">He said, "I want you to do something for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I want you to take a package to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I said, "But I am not going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">He said, "If you take this package you are." </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I said, "What will be in the package?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And he said, "A quarter of a million dollars." </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I said, "That's too big a package."

"</span><span class="sentence" id="1180">What." </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">The school children of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had been making Hanukiyot for the children of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">We have 36,000 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And we have candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">We don't know how to get them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Nobody ever thought of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I understand, he said, that you are flying in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I said, "Yes, and my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> has <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomb bays</span> , and I think it would be very nice if we filled the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomb bays</span> of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17</span> with Hanukiyot and candles." </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I sent a military TWX to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Si Pava</span> to alert everybody he could alert to come to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> at Piece boden and pick up their Hanukiyot and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">All 36,000 of them got distributed in about 24 hours to Jews all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , all over the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And...uh...that was some Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">By the way, I don't have one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">We distributed them all.

been organized for a very simple purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">They had to buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ships</span> are expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">The only place they really could buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> was the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because they wanted larger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1242"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ships</span> for 2 or 3 hundred people were not going to be able to do this thing anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">They needed big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So they were going to buy them in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and they sent 4 Palestinians over, led by who later became , the first chief of staff of the Israel army, later the President of the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">A marvelous, marvelous man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">When I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I went into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , naturally, and asked me if I would go to work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">As long as I had to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for a little while making speeches for the Haganah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">So from the end of April 1946 until February 1947, I was on the staff of the Haganah in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> making speeches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Esther and I lived in <span

id="1253">And...uh...so we found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="REGION">Staten Island</span> , and we lived over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">It was not a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">I was away more than I was there....uh... making the same speech over and over and over again to secret meetings of Jews to get money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">Was not my style, but it was what had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">There was some compensation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">There was a rainy night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I don't remember what month when I was allowed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And down on the <span class="DLF">docks</span> was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , then called the SS Warfield. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">The Warfield being the same person as the Duchess of Windsor because her daddy was the President of the steamboat company that ran <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamboats</span> up around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chesapeake

had bought, and we were sending off to Europe to transport Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">We estimated that maybe 25,000 Jews uncomfortable could get on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">When it sailed in June of 47 to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as the exodus 1947, it had 52 hundred people on board, and

non-existent Jewish navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Gave it flag, and all the rest of the . </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">A word ought to be said about Americans for Haganah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">It was an astonishing organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">It's head was a multi-millionaire oil man named Rudolph Sonaborn, whose last claim to fame was that he married Dorothy Shift, the publisher of the New York Post then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">But he gave at least half his time to Americans for Haganah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">We met every Tuesday for lunch in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and...uh... books have been written about this operation, which was clandestine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">The bank account was the bank account of the <span class="BUILDING">Palestine pavilion</span> of the New York Worlds Fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">There had been a New York World's Fair in 1930...what...8, 9, something like that, and they never closed the bank account of the...of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish pavilion</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Palestine Pavilion</span> it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And that money was funneled through the Palestine Pavilion bank account, and we never got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Later, there was trouble with armed shipments to the Haganah, but that was much later, after the Foundation was dated as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">This group that met on Tuesdays was a remarkable bunch, and the fact that we raised several million dollars for the purchase of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> is amazing because we were a small group and you couldn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">You couldn't do the usual kinds of fund raising hoopla. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">We met in people's rumpus rooms, they were called in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">They are called <span class="INT_SPACE">family rooms</span> today, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And...uh...everybody had to know everybody, and they couldn't talk about it, and they had to get lots of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">It was a wild operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I did not enjoy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">One of my tasks, for example, was to go once a week for lunch to the <span class="BUILDING">21 Club</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> because one of the Krinlers was interested in us, and he introduced me to all these degenerate people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">He used to hang out at the <span class="BUILDING">21 Club</span> and I'd get money from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">Uh...Some of the ladies were very frank about where they money came from and how it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And I had a conscious problem about this, but it didn't last because buying the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> was more important than my Jewish conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">But it was a tough time for my family and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">We were relieved when finally, finally, finally the paperwork was done, and we could get back to Europe, we thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and went in back in to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Got us a <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="1304">ANSWER:  One day in early Fall (clearing throat) 1945 I walked into our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> and I went upstairs and I heard very loud sounds, kids stomping and shouting, and so I went to see what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">There about 20 teenagers with this short, very short, heavy set, young, young man leading them in a dance...in a song. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">was the theme and stuff and he had those kids going absolutely mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And I watched this guy and said to myself, "He's a leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">That man is a leader." </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">So I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">His name was Leon Retter from , a genius who had been sent by the Russians to the <span class="BUILDING">language school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> when he was 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">He spoke then and still speaks somewhere between 10 and 15 languages quite fluently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">He was a captain in the Red Army during the war, and at the end of the war decided that he wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">This was what he wanted that he wanted to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">So he ran away, and came into <span class="REGION">American zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">Landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">some months later his girlfriend joined him and they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">They are still married and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for reasons which will become clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">Uh...We had organized not only the central committee, but regional committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">More people involved the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">He became a member of our regional committee, and then I...uh...let Klausner know, as a matter of fact, that I thought this guy was...uh...good material and Klausner met him, moved him down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and Irea which is the name he took instead of Leon,...uh...for reasons that have to do with language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Leon means lion and Irea means lion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Their translation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And Redder became just because he wanted it to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">He...uh...became the foreign secretary of the displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">It was he who dealt with the big people who came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">It was he who went to <span class="BUILDING">Frankfort headquarters</span> to, as he said, make demands on behalf...on behalf of the Jewish displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Tough minded,...uh...brilliant orator who in the spring of 1946 was sent to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for his first UJA missions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And he has done UJA off and on ever since until his retirement about 2 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">He's 68 now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">He...uh.. should have become a major political figure, but...uh...Mr. Ben-Gurion was rather capricious about his boys, as he called them, and when there was a revolt against Ben-Gurion within the Labor Party, in the 50's, Irea joined the revolt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And the old man punished him and then made him do projects for him afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Irea decided that the way to get along in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was to be independent, and so he become <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 's first management consultant on human relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">As new immigrant groups came in, there were all kinds of tensions and problems and he would work with those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">He's a remarkable fellows, still one of my very closest friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">He had the right kind of hutspah in huge amounts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Uh...It was fun to watch him telling General Clay what General Clay had to do.

Well, we had a Congress of Displaced Persons...uh...1n the first year, and unquestionably, the most influential individual there, besides Klausner, was Nesher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">Okay, that's Nesher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">That's who he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">That's who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">Uh...He went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in time for the War of Independence cause he insisted on doing so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">He and Lilly took a bunch of kids on a legal trip because there were some... And both of them went into the Army, and I tease them to this day about the fact that she outranked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">He was a sergeant and she was a lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Lilly, his wife, is one of the experts on Soviet Jewry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">She was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union when nobody was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And...uh...still there was a great deal about Soviet Jewry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">Okay, so much for Nesher Klausner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">When I saw Klausner at the Chaplains’ meeting, first time I had seen him since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and we made all the plans and started the package system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Uh...It was clear that any Chaplain who wanted to do the job right should do so in consultation with Abe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">The leaders of the DPs were his. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">He was the President. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">The processes of the central committee he was in the middle of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">He tried not to deal with the U.S. Army because he was absent without leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">He spent total of 8 months absent without leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">He had no assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">He didn't get paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">He also did not do anything for the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">He was unconnected to the American Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">He met every once in awhile with some general, but he was unconnected with the American Army and nobody realized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Uh...I knew it, but what the heck? </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">It wasn't my business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">One day I had to go to 3rd Army Headquarters in . </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">That was the day I saw all of General Patton's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> and his private...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fleet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">Chaplain's office</span> to get whatever I went to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I don't remember what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And I heard a voice call, "Chaplain." </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">So everybody in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> turned around because there must have been 15 chaplains in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and this guy from inside the <span class="BUILDING">private office</span> was pointing his finger at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And I said, "Yes, Sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And I went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">A bird Colonel...uh...O'Reilley, he's Senior Chaplain of the 3rd Army, regular Army Catholic, and he said, "What's your name, Chaplain?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I told him my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And he said, "Tell me Lipman, do you happen to know a Chaplain named Klausner?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">I thought, "Oh, boy!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">I said, "Which one, Sir?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And he crossed himself and said, "Holy Mary, Mother of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">Don't tell me there are two of them." </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">And I said, "Yes, Sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">There's Chaplain Berkland Klausner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">There's Chaplain Abraham Klausner." </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">What I knew that he didn't know was that Berk Klausner was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but that didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">I was telling the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">He said, "You know, I have been hearing rumors about a Chaplain Klausner in my <span class="REGION">area</span> , but I don't get monthly reports from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Do you ever see him." </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">And I said, "I suppose I could find him if I tried hard." </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">He said, "Would you do me a favor?"

<p><span class="sentence" id="1702">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">Uh...How did you start preparing for the Exodus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1705">ANSWER:  Well, first of all we got a call from Paulette, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> on a certain date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">The largest transport that had ever been contemplated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">And the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> did their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">And it was decided that two of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> would go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , by way of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , and three of them would go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they would be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come back, load up, and do this three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">Two of them being Saturday nights, and one of them being mid- week which we had never done before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">But what're we going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">Because we had to get these people on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">The British were watching this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in sit where it was, and they didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so we rushed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">All of these people had to get new identities because we using a series of French transit visas that the Minister of the Interior people had kindly prepared for us, but they were...we would call in blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">They weren't really blank at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">They had names on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">They just weren't names of any living people, and they all had ages and they all had birth places. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">So we prepared in advance DP cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by UNRRA with military authorization and we had tens of thousands of them that we had printed and...uh...we issued new ones to all of these people with the proper stamps on them and then we handed them out at Nooam in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> there, and told them, "You got a new name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">You got to know how old you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">You got to know where you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">It has nothing to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">It has to do with whatever that name is on that piece of piece." </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">So they all had to learn them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">And some of the old people had difficulties with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">Kids had no trouble at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">There was one cute little kid with obviously orthodox origins was standing there holding these things and chuckling back and forth as he memorized his name and his birthplace and his birth date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">It was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">And then we took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">Normally, when we got <span class="BUILDING">Milhouse</span> there was a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">A wonderful lady owned it who fed us a hot meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">This is the staff who had gone on the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">The people were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> bound for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> already...and...uh...we'd spend the night and part of the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">Relax a little bit, have some fun, drink some good wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">I learned to eat pate for the first time and...<span class="BUILDING">Milhouse</span> 1s in...uh...SS Lorraine...that part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they made wonderful paté. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">So this time we got there early evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">We turned in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">Didn't have all that wonderful hospitality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">And in the middle of the night, we got back in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we went back to , and that night we loaded up and we did that three times in 8 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">Esy was not with me on the Exodus ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">I don't remember why not, but she wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">And...uh...when I left I said to her as I always did, "I'll be back when I get here," and all she would say to people who called was, "I am sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">He's out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">Have you tried the <span class="BUILDING">Munich office</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">Uh...This was the longest I had been away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">And she allowed as how she was a little bit apprehensive, but nothing we could do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">That's how the people got on the exodus. </span><span

for the railway officials to... These were private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">These weren't just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats on train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">Twelve hundred people is a lot of...lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">So these were three transports of between a thousand and twelve hundred each, and the other approximately two thousand went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">Then the exodus story doesn't end there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">It goes on because as people should know, the British sent that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">Not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> stayed in <span class="DLF">Haifa Harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">It's still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">By the way, it's falling apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">It is disintegrating and will not last forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">They've tried to preserve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">It's not working very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">It's been in a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">They sent the people back in three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Luke</span> , where they went on a hunger strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">They wouldn't get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">The British took them off by force, and then put them back on again and shipped them around to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburger</span> in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> where they were taken, by I think, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">One 1s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amistow</span> and one is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popendorf</span> where they incarcerated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">One of the things Abe Klausner did was organize their escape with a bunch of the Haganah people, and they escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">And one of my great stories was greeting some of them again at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nooam</span> when they went a second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">I don't know how many of them went the second time by Haganah, but I had all transport of them one night, twelve hundred of them who went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">They landed on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1770"><span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> requires specific mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">We made jokes about <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">We are going to have a Jewish State, but it's not going to be an ordinary state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">It's already an empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">It has a colony. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775"><span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">Because we had tens of thousands of Jews interned on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> by the British in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">The first immigrants who came into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after independence were the people from <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">They had priorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">God knows they had earned them, and they came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">That was <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">I have never been to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">I should go there some day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">What's next Linda?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1786">ANSWER:  Uh...I think we ought to do the baby before we forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1787">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1788">ANSWER:  A good friend of mine, displaced person, had a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">Called me from where they were, told me that they were in terrible trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">The child was born with infantile jaundice, and she was getting dehydrated and they weren't sure she could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">It was particularly painful because they were displaced persons and looked forward to this child, even more particularly painful for this father was a physician and didn't know how to save his child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">So Esther and I got into our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ...our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ...1t was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and we went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">When I got there the father told me in the most agonized tones I have ever heard that he had a decision to make and didn't know how to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">That 30 or 40 miles down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , not in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , was a very famous German...uh...obstetrician, pediatrician, who was barred from practicing medicine because he had not only been a Nazi, but he had done experiments on Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">But, said the father, this man can save my daughter if anybody can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">He has unique information and methods that nobody in this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> knows about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">I said, "I don't think I am asking you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">I think I am going to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">Your daughter's life is more important than the fact that this man was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">If he can save your daughter's life, that's saving the world for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">You gotta do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">So he decided we better do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">So I went down in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and met this doctor who was living in a little <span class="BUILDING">cabin</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">A very dignified, middle-aged man who spoke relatively good English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">I told him the circumstances and said we would pay him well to come and take care of this child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">And he said, "Alright." </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">And he got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> with his bag and he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">And he spent about 48 hours without sleep taking care of this baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">And he saved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">After it was all over, I drove him back to his <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> and gave him German money, a large sum and I said, "I trust that's enough for your services." </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">He said, "I don't care about the money." </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">He said, "I want a letter from you addressed to military government saying that you recommend that I be permitted to practice again because I saved this Jewish child." </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">Now I said, in effect, "Doctor, you should live so long." </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">And I left the money, and I left with him not being very happy with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">The end of this story 1s not a pleasant one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">The child developed acute leukemia at the age of 4 and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">The family had other children, but that was a bad blow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">That was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">You know who to talk to if you want more about that one, and if that person says to you, "Cut it completely," I insist you have to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">She has a perfect right to her privacy and if this 1s too much to identification it's got to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">Next, after the exodus we went into a bad time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">Uh...First of all, all the stuff was going on at the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">Would there be a Jewish State, whether or not there would be a Jewish State, where they'd be partitioned, wouldn't there be partition and what should we be doing meanwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">So I sat in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> day after day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> doing not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">Uh...Taught English to a couple of medical students at <span class="BUILDING">Heildelberg University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">Uh...This, I think, is worthwhile story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">Uh...The <span class="BUILDING">University</span> gave 15 fellowship to Jewish survivors to study medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">Full tuition and books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">Three of them I still have communication with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">One of them was my secretary's husband, and...uh...he practices as an internist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and we are good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">I taught him English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">She was my secretary because she spoke Hebrew, German, Yiddish, Hungarian, Russian, and was a remarkable woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">She still is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">Her husband 1s a good doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">Two of them are my story really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">It...uh...has to be told backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">About two years ago, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , my wife attended a seminar at the Washington School of Psychiatry, being conducted by two very imminent psychiatrists from the University of Cincinnati Medical School, named Ornstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">Anna and Paul Ornstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">They had the full day and Esther went up at the end to thank them, and Anna said to her, "Tell me your name again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">I want to remember you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">She told her her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">Paul, who was standing about 10 feet away, came over and said, "What did you say your name was?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">She told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">He said, "Are you by any chance related to...to Chaplain Lipman." </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">Anybody who calls me Chaplan Lipman goes back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">She said, "Yes, I am married to him." </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">At which point, he bursts into tears, threw his arms around her and wouldn't let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">He and Anna had been two of those medical students in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">Very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">They had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">The Germans would do nothing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">They lived, aside from going to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> which they wanted to do, for Friday night for whenever I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we had a Shabbat service, and if anybody else could conduct one when I wasn't there, they had a Shabbat service, followed by a Shabbat dinner for all the Jews in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">Displaced persons, G.I.s, the Palestinians who might be passing through because our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a way station for any illegal going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">We had 4 <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> with 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army cots</span> and we had as many as 14 people on a given night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">Uh...And then of course the arms and the czar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">They came and went without us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">They had a key to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and they moved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">After the service and dinner, we sit around and talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">And it was the only adult conversation these people had and they thought of the Chaplain as somebody very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">The next night after this revelation, Paul gave a lecture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and I went and then we went out afterwards to drink coffee and begin to catch and he looked at me and he smiled and he said, "You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">It's eerie." </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">I said, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">He said, "You are only 4 years older than I am." </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">I said, "Oh, you're thinking of that Chaplain." </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">He said, "That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">I have never quite gotten rid of that image." </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">I said, "Please get rid of it (laughter) real fast." </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">And we have seen a great deal of one another since then, and are good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">The person who saved their lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heildelberg</span> was a Protestant minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">Herman Maus,...uh... whom I call the of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heildeberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">I read an article about him once. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">He had been a very famous pastor...uh...before World War II was pastor of the <span class="BUILDING">Holy Ghost Church</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">He had become a Zionist in 1933 because when he grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Titisay</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> , his father, a poor pastor, had not been able to send him to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">A Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Titisay</span> came to him and said, "Herman, you want to be a pastor like a father don't you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">And he said, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">You have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , don't you." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1878">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">Okay, you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I will take care of the bills. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">You just be a good pastor." </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">The year he graduated and was ordained the Jewish friend said, "Herman, you've done well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">Before you take up your first congregation, you have a vacation coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">He handed him some money and told him to take a vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">And he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he turned up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bail</span> during the 1903 Zionist Convention, the famous one at which the Uganda Resolution was turned down, and he met Hertzl and he met Nordau and he met all of those people, and he joined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">David Yellin became his particular friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">He made his first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with his wife and daughter in 1933 this summer, and he said to David Yellin, "I'm not going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">There is where I belong and this is where I want to stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">And Yellin said to him, "Herman, you haven't earned the right to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">You have to go back and to earn it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">The daughter said, "My father can go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">I am not going." </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">And the daughter remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , became a weaver, until after World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">When her father got very old, she went back to care of them because the mother couldn't anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">But she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">He came back and because he was a pacifist, he went to every peace meeting there was anywhere in Europe carrying messages about how to get Jewish kids out, how to save this, how to save that, and he did that until 1941 when the Germans picked him up and put him in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">And he and his wife both spent the war years in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and they both survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">He came back and became Dean of the Diocese, that's second to the Bishop and did several things which were characteristic of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">First of all, every Yom Kippur, he spent all day in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and fasted as penance for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">Second of all, he announced to his congregation, that is to the people he dealt with, that for the rest of his life he would never preach a sermon on a New Testament theme. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">That it was time that Christians went back to their origins and learned what they should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">He preached only out of the Hebrew bible for the rest of his life, and he never missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">Third of all, every Jewish displaced person around he would take food to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">He visited all of these students at least once a week bringing them food on condition that they tell nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">My secretary never told me that she ever had a visit from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">Anna and Paul told me last year about their relationship with Maus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">Maus had been to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">I had been to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">He took me to meet Carl Yasburs, and we had an incomprehensible conversation one day (laughter) and...uh..but he never told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">No one told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">They kept their promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">He looked after these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">I think it's absolutely fitting that there is a large <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> named for him, and it pleases me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">You know this 1s all part of the Heidelberg saga.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1915">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">Let us break at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">We're going to break and change tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1918">ANSWER:  You know what we ought to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1919">QUESTION:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1920">ANSWER:  It's a quarter after 2:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">My own suggestion would be that we break until you have a chance to read this stuff and I have a chance to go through the letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">I have mentioned a number of times the role that luck played in getting results and coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">Luck every one in awhile reunited a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">I have one particular memory of being in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , and a young woman came in, kind of agitated and excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">She had heard a rumor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">She had no living relatives so far as she knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">Everybody had been killed, but she heard a rumor that maybe her younger brother had survived and was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">And I said, "Do you have any idea where?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">And she said, "Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">I think so." </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">I said, "The way to find out is to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">There's no point in trying to do it...uh...by any other way." </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">So we got in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">We got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and found a Jew and asked around and it was her brother and he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">And we really should have tape recorders in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">Every recording of the looks on their faces as they met each other, each believing...having been forced to believe that the other was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">Every once in awhile a tragedy occurred however in this connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">I remember a case, sad case, which has since been written up in the annals of Jews Law. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">I didn't decide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">A guy came in to one of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> , lived there, and did not know what had become of his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">Went on the assumption that she was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">We took a sort of informal position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">Jewish law didn't permit it, but we took it informally that as a certain date there would be a presumption that anybody who hadn't been heard from was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">I don't remember whether it was 2 years or what length of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">And we...we knew this was an informal, not...uh...sanctioned, position in Jewish law, but...uh...people had to get on with their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">And a lot of people were just plain missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">There was no way to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">And this man met a woman, wanted to marry her, and...uh...the time came and they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">And 6 months later, his first wife turned up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">She had been off in <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> over in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> somewhere and it had taken a long time for her to get out and to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">Under Jewish law, of course, he had to divorce both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">And as happens so often, one does not hear the end of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">I don't know with which one he ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">I am not sure that it matters at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">The dilemma...that was a very poignant one, and the fact that I have only one story out of the many hundreds of people...uh...with whom I came into contact during those 3 years is, I think, a marked statement of the propriety of making a decision that just set a date after which you have to gamble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">You gamble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">For most of the people, they had a little mazal and the gamble was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">When they married, they could stay married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">I don't think it's good luck that one's first spouse is dead, but there it is

<p><span class="sentence" id="1960">ANSWER:  We finished our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">We had a huge celebration in November when the partition plan was announced...uh.......decided not to send transports thereafter because what was the point of...of that, and then changed our minds because it was a good idea to keep pressure on the British and have more people go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">So we did somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">Not a great deal though. </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">Much of it by then was being done from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constansus</span> or from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , not from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and I simply don't know about those operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">One of the generalizations that you have to know about is that none of us knew anything we didn't have to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">People keep asking me did you know so and so who worked on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">One of my closest friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibitz</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 1s a man who was one of the leaders of the Berichah in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">I never met him in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">I met him in 1960 when I got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> because he was not my business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">I knew what I had to know and nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , it's called "need to know." </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">Uh...the doctrine of secrecy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">But by February, March of 1948, it was clear that the State would come in to be, and that our work, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berichah</span> , would end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">There would be lots of people at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , a lot of to become Israelis would have to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">To help and to work and to teach and all the things that they were doing legally, but I was none of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">My operation would end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">I turned down, with thanks, the suggestion, an urgent one, from of my...uh...I[sraeli friends that I take Esther and our one and half children and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and fly for the upcoming air force which at that point had one and a half piper cubs, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">I said, "No, Thanks, that...that isn't how I wanted to die," as a matter (laughter) and decided very reluctantly to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">Mostly because of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">That there was a war coming was clear, and...uh... I had had my war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">So, in...uh...April of 48, we tried to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">It was almost as hard to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as it was to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because the American Army had forms and you had to fill them out, and a pregnant wife caused problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">We wanted desperately to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">I have a thing for <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , and take the <span class="BUILDING">Oslo home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">They wouldn't let us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> did not have a full-time physician on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">Although my wife was having the healthiest pregnancy in the history of the world, but there had to be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">The Army would not take responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">So we decided to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the SS America from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauf</span> , and we close up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and shipped everything <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">Michael was very disturbed because nothing he was ever going to see again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">He was 3, and....uh...he couldn't bring his dog, and I think that bothered him more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">He...uh...he really a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">But we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , settled in for a couple of days and went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">Two of the people in the world closest to us were Eva Kaufman, now Eva Kaufman Penn, and her late husband, Rabbi Jay Kaufman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">They had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> in 1946 for Jay to get a doctorate at <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">Uh...They tried to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the middle of the Maritime strike, and they got held up, and stayed at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staten Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">When they left they were allowed to go, but they couldn't take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">They had <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and stayed with us until Paul was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">It was this kind of relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">Then they disappeared in the wilds of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">What we heard about them once in awhile was from Jay's parents who would drop us a note saying they got a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">They were okay, and then we didn't get that any more for awhile because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> was under siege, and they were in the of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and we went to to the and Michael was riding a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kiddie car</span> up and down the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , and we suddenly heard a scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">It was Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">She and Jay had tickets for the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">Coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">And she was 2 weeks more pregnant than Esther, and we had a 5 day trip across the Atlantic which was an extraordinary experience, just trying to catch up with one another with these two very pregnant ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">Their son, their first child, was born on <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 's independence day, and our second child was born 2 weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">I had had an offer from Henry Montaur, the head of the UJA, and the world's greatest fund raiser in all of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">I would add here that the 1948 UJA campaign raised a hundred and 80 million dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">As of that date, that was the largest fund raising campaign in private hands in the history of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">And it was not surpassed for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">Now, of course, it sounds like small money thanks to inflation, but 1t was an absolutely amazing out-pouring of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">Uh...And I spent 3 months doing speaking full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">One of my first speeches was on the night of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 's independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">Why was I sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">Because the featured speaker was the Senator from <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , Alban Berkley, shortly to become Vice President of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">Now Barkley was one of the world's worst speakers in terms of content, but he was an affable pleasant guy and he loved Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">And he went around making speeches for Jews and for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and for Zionism all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">So he was to be the featured speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">He made a very short speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">He walked over, wrapped himself in the Israel flag, and the cameras popped and I made a sort of content speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">Only later I discovered how much money he was paid for all the speeches he made for the Zionist movement and for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and for the UJA and the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">Fortunately, I make it a practice not to have illusions about public figures, so I didn't get disillusioned about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">Uh...He was not a pleasant experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">Most of them were very pleasant experiences because to watch people give more money than they ought to give...uh...has its beauties. </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">And the statements they made. </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">Uh...I didn't fight in the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">I was too old. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">I was not involved in the decimation of our people in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">Therefore, the least I can do is pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">And the money poured in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">Unbelievable amounts of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">I learned to respect sacrificial giving for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">There has been very little of it, of course, but I respect 1t when I find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">I was invited to go to Hawaii to open their campaign. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">That was exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">Never been to <span class="COUNTRY">Hawaii</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">And I understood that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hawaii Jewish community</span> was all excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">When you're that far away, you get more excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">Excitement grows in direct proportion to the distance from the action. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">And...uh...Montra called, asked me to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">I said, "What dates?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">And he said, "Well, the affair is on June 2nd, but you would have to go a day or 2 early because it's a long way." </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">And I said, "Forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">Not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2048">We're due to have a baby right on June 2nd." </span><span class="sentence" id="2049">And...uh...he kinda said, "So what?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">And I understood that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">I said, "Well, I wasn't there when the first one was born, and I have solemn advice from my wife that if I am not there when the second one is born, there won't be a third and I won't have a wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">And I believe her." </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">And he was a little bit upset, but he accepted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">As it happens, the child was born on June the Ist so it was very sensible of me to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">Those 3 months were exhilarating and exhausting. </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">And then I settled down for the first time since I had become a Rabbi to be a Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">I accepted a position at our <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> to teach and to get my doctorate and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> and became people for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">No longer did our son Michael get into a pullman berth and say, "<span class="BUILDING">Home</span> ," which he had done a number of times when he was 2 years old and traveling constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">I'm done. </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">Finished.</span></p>
