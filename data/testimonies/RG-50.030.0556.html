<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  I was born in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horodenka</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which is now the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , and I was born on April 25", 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And what was your name at birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Rena Koch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And what was your family like? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">What did your parents do for a living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  My father owned a <span class="BUILDING">textile store</span> , my mother was with him in the business, and we had the housekeeper at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I had an older brother, who was four — four years older than I was, and we — basically, she took care of us at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Well, my father went, you know, in — in Europe basically most people were religious, at least that’s what I was aware of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  My father did go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , and prayed every morning and did go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Of course, kept kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And I wasn’t really aware of that much more of what religious meant; I thought all Jews were religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  So you celebrated the holidays, and — and —
ANSWER:  Yes, oh, definitely, this was part of —
QUESTION:  — and Shabbat, and —
ANSWER:  — Shabbat, yeah, that was a-all part of life and I felt that that’s the way it has to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  So, how old were you when you s — did you start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where you —
ANSWER:  I never started s —
QUESTION:  You never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  — I never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until after we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So basically, at that point I was almost nine years old before I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , without knowing how to read or write.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  So, when the war started, you — you were on the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span> , or you were on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  We were on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> , and then the — the Soviets came in in —I guess in 1940, maybe, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  And tha — and of course, and then the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The Soviets, we were a little bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to — my father was afraid that they’d take him to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we thought that maybe ca — jer — he thought that maybe ki — when the Germans came in, they didn’t — they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But of course we discovered very quickly otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And after awhile, which I don’t really remember how long, they formed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and everybody from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> — our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Cause I remember people basically dying, I don’t know how long it took after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was forming, but on our <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> there would be dead people that have — from hunger, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And we basically, since we were in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , I imagine my — my parents may have stored some food, so I don’t remember being hungry at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Maybe I was too young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti — akejas they call it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The first one we — we had relatives outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they — we went there, to outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My father, I think, remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but my grandfather, when we came back, we discovered my father’s father was killed, right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He was shot right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then the second one, we went into hiding someplace outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But the third one, my father brought us to a Christian family, and he — they said that all workers should come and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And after a day or two, he will come and get us. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And it took about a week and he never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking out — out of the — their — wherever they hid us, in their <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And they were shotti — shooting after us, you know, when we — they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And we went back to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but eventually this akcja must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they chased us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab — she had a — her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it — to take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">As a child I was able to sneak by with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And this is basically — that eventually saved our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And then they made Judenfrei, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father’s side had survived, and then an aunt, my father’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and we — I guess my mother must have known that across this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And you — you were able to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> right acro — from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and hiding in there, and a young student came across. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and — and take you across. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He carried me across, because I was the youngest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had — whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And we came to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potok Zloty</span> , and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And we went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buczacz</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buczacz</span> we lived with a family that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And there were also many akcjas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And right after the akeja I’d come out and they’d say, the children are dead, they’re — they’re gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Or — and one day I came out and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> full of dead children, with bleed — blood coming out of the — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">You know, when — so I was always ready, I was afraid I’d be left behind, being the — the youngest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So as soon as they — I’d be — at night or whatever, I’d be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And basically after this — you know, after — I’m — I’m not sure of how much time passed, they made that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> Judenfrei, and my — and we had an-another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , my ki — father’s relatives, cousins were there, and they — I don’t how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kopyezynce</span> was that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And we went in — we stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And of course then it started over there; the — the killings started over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my f-— relatives’ son, they — he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> from that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in to under the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> it was camouflaged, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There were a couple of akcjas there, but this was like the last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We we — all went into this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , we were 30 some odd people that went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And they must — they built a air — you know, some type of air, to give us air in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we — that there was a — that we — there was a <span class="DLF">bunker</span> under there, so they started digging from the other side the <span class="DLF">street</span> and came in that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And then they realized that there had to be an <span class="DLF">opening</span> in a — in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know, that we — how we got in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So they discovered us on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And basically, I don’t know what happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">A — but I was holding onto my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr — they thought that he was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And then we — we — when — after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">At night we snuck out of there, went into a — into another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , out onto a <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We stayed there for a long time without any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my — my throat was closing up from not eating or drinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But there was like a — a — a rusty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tub</span> , or whatever with the — with the water was leaking from the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And she found a straw and made me drink the water with a st — through a straw, because it was feathers and dirt in that water. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And then we were discovered there. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But if — they only robbed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There were some other people from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> that survived, another three men, I think wi-with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And — you know, and they let us — they — they told us, this is the end, they’re gonna — going to keep killing until all the Jews are gone, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But there is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> outside of — of — that some Jews are working on the labor — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">To us, of course, 1t was a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we weren’t there very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — walled ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But we — these two men that were with us on that <span class="DLF">roof</span> came down with us and looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And they found like an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , I don’t know what it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They threw me over the — th — over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and we started running away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And it was — a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the — the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , the Jews were escaping, and they start — they shot after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Well, we were able to get to — I think one of the man got — you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and there was — the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of days in — my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> where Jews were still working. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We got there and we — we s — we got there at night and there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They were always afraid that at night they’d come and get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We were in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that wasn’t quite finished yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They came to rob us again, and they — my mother had — at this point she had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and they touched her boot that it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So they hit her to get off the boot and she refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She said, we’ll scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren’t allowed to rob. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So they got scared and ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And then morning came, and my mother went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and ta — find out if she could work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And the man that was in charge of labor — my mother happened to have been a beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in her — 1n his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a Polish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So she says, but I have two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So he said, two children, he says, do you have a-— so she says, I have a son and a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Says well, no son, I cannot help you with a son, but with a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But a couple of days later he said to her, I—1f you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a friend that would be willing to hide you <span class="NPIP">outside</span> into — in a — outside in another <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And my mother said she didn’t — she was afraid to say that she had the money with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But she said, I have money in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I will sneak back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and dig it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She wanted to make sure that he meant it. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And sure enough, he did have a friend, he sends a worker from that other <span class="DLF">farm</span> to pick us up, you know, to — to take us — he wanted gold dollars, he didn’t want — so we were very lucky to have gold and not paper money. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And they took us to this other f— to this other <span class="DLF">farm</span> , or to — you know what — what it was, it was — was a lot of people working for him, he was like the boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And they put us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , they — 1t was an empty <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And he — the man didn’t tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as a — he was the bookkeeper on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But he was a Jew, and he passed himself off as a— you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I mean, mostly it was potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And being the youngest one after we were there for eight months, and then they started — rumors were he ki — brought back rumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the war, and they were coming closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And the partisans were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we were hoping we’d get liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But eventually, of course, the — the war came closer, and I think that they — that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So they moved us to a still. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But the — and the still in — these big barrels in a still, and — and then we went up to the — the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , I don’t — and they were going to bomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> because they didn’t want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And we heard them talking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you know, that this is next, they were going to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And we didn’t really know if we were — if the Russians were coming, if the rai — so we stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they — they couldn’t bring it to us over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Eventually they came and they told us you’re liberated, you’re free. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet were swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we got <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And — and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they were — some Jews started coming out of — you know, there were a couple of families came out of hiding, and we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So basically, that was our liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And then we started running because the war was going on right near us. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We tried to go closer to the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And other people were coming out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , and they had typhus, and my mother and I both got typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And we — that part is completely like way — vague in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I know that I couldn’t walk, that I lost my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But I, you know — and eventually, as it quieted down, we worked ourselves back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , hoping that there would somebody be left, somebody would be — you know, we didn’t know what — the fate of my father, we just —
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  — knew that he didn’t come back, and my mother’s sisters, grandmothers, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You know, so we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and some Jews finally unfil — you know, came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Some of the Jews that — we stayed there for awhile, and that’s when the first — when it got a little bit — they wanted the children to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> —
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  — so that was my first experience to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> at that point —
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  — but it was the Russians — within weeks they changed it to <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And then we ha — we — since we were Polish citizens, we — we were able to get — go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , since this became <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, right.</span></p>
