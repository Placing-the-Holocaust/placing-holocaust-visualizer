<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Amalie Petranker. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Now it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salsitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born October 21st, 1922 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I was just born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was an accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My mother was visiting there, but I was raised, brought up and till '42 I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanistlawow</span> (ph) which is now . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It's very much to the southeast of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landberg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="8"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanistlawow</span> was considered a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It...a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with inhabitants a hundred thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">From there forty thousand Jews, forty thousand Ukrainians, and twenty thousand Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Before the outbreak of the war, Polish government wanted to Polanize it, so they brought Poles from , from the <span class="DLF">German border</span> and they settled them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanistlawow</span> in order to increase the Polish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanistlawow</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanistlawow</span> was a modern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It became big after the Ist World War, has beautiful <span class="DLF">parks</span> , <span class="DLF">boulevards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Had many <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> and each minority its own <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , like the Jews had their <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The Ukrainians had <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian gymnasium</span> , and the Germans had a <span class="BUILDING">German gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And naturally we had state gymnasiums and there very few Jews were accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was numerous classes, so means a certain number, only seven percentage of the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Majority of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanistlawow</span> were progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We had a small nucleus of Hasidic (ph) Jews but they lived in this one <span class="REGION">section</span> which later became <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Uh...
QUESTION:  Tell us about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  My family. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My parents were very progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My father was a , a Zionist, who believed very much in education. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He was very well rounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He had the Jewish education and he was a graduate of <span class="BUILDING">Agriculture School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">For him, education was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My mother also was a graduate of the uh art (ph) school. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">This was a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They have something like this now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mother went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">All the subjects were taught in German because most of my mother's family was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so they wanted her to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My fath...my father was a modern Jew, and his knowledge, especially in Judaic studies taught him well because he was in lumber business and the Jews didn't like to go with any every case to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , so they selected like judges, , and my father was selected to be a because he knew the Jewish law and because he was so educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">For him, or Hebrew scholars was just the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He also had a hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He was a painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And wha...this saved him when he was in the army because when he was in the Austrian army, Jews were just plain soldiers, and actually they used to be even orderlies (ph) to officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They have to clean their boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But because of his ability to draw he worked in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he printed and drew the announcement proclamations that they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My father's family was quite well to do before the Ist World War, but after the war, when they were burned out, they had lumber business. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Uh they had uh uh <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , and they had an <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> , but they lost a lot of money, so what remained is only education and this made a very deep impression on my late father. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So having three daughters he said I will try to prepare for them dowry, but I'm not sure if they will be able to take advantage, so my duty is to give them very good education, so at least they will have something to stand, which will sustain them, that he would have foreseen what future would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My mother was a very easy-going, very sweet woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">She was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">She was twenty-two only when I was born, and twenty-one when my oldest sister, so she was like one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And maybe it's good she was easy- going, because my late father was like a Prussian officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He didn't have any sons, so he actually treated us like we'll be in the army, like soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He was fair but very demanding, so she in a way protected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Sometimes when he was strict, she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He demanded, but now I'm very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">At that time it was very hard on us, like for example, we attended <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He wanted us to be protected from being called kikes and Jews, so from the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> ...we went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew kindergarten</span> where all, we spoke only Hebrew...we went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> from the first grade to the sixth where all the subjects were taught in Hebrew except History in Polish, then we went...so of course <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> because the language, prevalent language was Polish, but we continued with our Judaic studies, and we were three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My older one was Pepi (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I was the middle one and my younger one was Teela (ph) and we were just a year apart, so like first, second, third grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Second, third and fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So we were called inschool _, ; , (laughter) because we were so...just a year apart, you know, and we looked alike. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">As a matter of fact, I looked...my younger sister looked very much like I. My older...little bit...she was platinum blonde with blue eyes and unfortunately I was the middle and the shortest and the smallest. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I was unhappy because in Europe was accepted to hand-down, so naturally the oldest gave to the middle and the middle to the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">In my case, I got stuff from my youngest one, so it wasn't so pleasant for me, so I had to prove myself and there I tried to excel in studies, like not only what we had a lot of work in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was very demanding because it was very expensive and unless we performed our parents took us out from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , would take us out and we would have to learn vocation, but our ambition really was to be...to finish and to cont...to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , so I remember when it came Sabbath, this was the only day off. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Instead we should be off and go with our friends for a walk, so winter time, every Friday night, my father after dinner sat down with us and we had to study with him , the of the Sages (ph) and also the , the Savior from the Weak (ph), and every Saturday, summer time, . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">At that time we resented it very much and I resented it very much and being the middle one, I had to show I am the best, so...because I was the smallest one...so uh then we were rewarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Whoever knew got money, spending money to go to the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And God forbid if we didn't know what happened someplace to my older sister, so she was the pride of the spending money, for allowance, which was really a tragedy for her at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And you see also not only that we had to read books for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My father assigned to us books and every Saturday we had to finish by Saturday and discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So education was very stressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My mother was very active like in PTA. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We had lunchtime...like every Tuesday she used to serve lunch in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I was very proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">She was a very pretty woman, on the heavy side with her beautiful smile, very pretty face. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Now my father was in lumber business but I think two, three years before the start of of the war, it was nationalized and our part by the government and it was called . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Being my father was quite known and prominent in lumber business, the director from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> came and told him, you cannot be director of because you are Jewish, but you will be the vice director, and he nominated as the director, and I mentioned because later on I'll tell you...he was helpful in my survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As a rule, we were sheltered. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We didn't have a lot to do with the Christian population. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Actually each minority kept to itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We didn't have too much problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Only our problem arose during the holidays or on Sundays, because other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was next to a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , so this was a day free for them to throw stones on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">As children I resented it to be singled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But this was something we couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It...even when...it became so bad before the outbreak of the war, that the police advised our custodian...we had an iron gate around our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...to keep it closed, so they shouldn't be able to enter our <span class="DLF">school yard</span> and to throw stone and to beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there were some incidents of anti-Semites, especially when there were students came from <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> at Christmas time and Easter and they wanted and they liked to beat up the Jews, but we had Jews who were actually very strong physically, the butchers, the uh drivers and later they learned to be prepared and they used to take a two-by-four and fight back. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They didn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Now uh we had good relationship with the Ukrainians because they also were minorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So before the war, they co....they cooperated with the Jews in commerce and in business, like my late father needed for example a loan. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He went, he got a loan from <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian bank</span> , but not from the Bellish (ph) uh, <span class="BUILDING">Polish bank</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">state bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I had many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We were three daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My <span class="BUILDING">house</span> always was full with friends, because even if...to each one of us came one friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My closest friend was Junior (ph) Lawber (ph) and happens that she was named like my mother, Frederika (ph) Junior, and I was named like her mother, because my parents called me Malia (ph) and her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We were very close friends and this was through the whole war. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And also I was very close to my younger sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We loved each other so much that when my parents wanted for my sister and to make sure that she would listen, they came to me and they used to joke, what will happen when Malia will get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">With whom will you be, although it was only one-year difference between us, but my older didn't want to bother with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">She went with other friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And we had beautiful <span class="DLF">parks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We participated. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Wintertime, the winter vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We went skiing. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We had pretty normal, happy life. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It's true it was not the life of all the Jews in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There was a select group, middle and above which could afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">There were poor Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">There were Jews who after the mandatory six grades went to learn vocation, to be a seamstress or to be a salesgirl. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I would say there are some very poor who just didn't have even money for Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We had some magnets (ph) like , very very rich who donated <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> to the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Majority barely eked out a living, but was a group like my parents, middle and above, who were quite comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">This was un...until the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">In '31, in September, broke out the German war, uh the World War, but we had...
QUESTION:  You mean '31...
ANSWER:  '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">At that time I was not even seventeen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">First, '39, after a few weeks, we read a proclamation that the Russian army...I think after a week or two...that the Russian army will come for order and safety of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> 'till the situation will be cleared and that we should cooperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So far...when the war broke out we had bombs, bombing and a few Jews were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But this was at the beginning, in '39, September. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The Russians came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They occupied it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was not for time being like we were told, and we had never dealt with the Communists, with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We didn't know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So we wanted to get some feeling, some understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So we stopped the soldiers to ask them, to question about the life in Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">When we questioned them, they told us everything in superlative, so Jews were very skeptical so we, So some just asked and tell me...how about ; . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Do you have a lot of ? </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And they said no, . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So we knew it's all uh propaganda and not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Our life changed drastically. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Special the middle-class and the rich or the so-called bourgeois...like my parents were given a special paragraph, paragraph 11 - means we were any moment destined to be shipped to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , and in a way I wish it would happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Maybe my parents would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And also, I was at that time, I graduated from first . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I was supposed to go to the second and graduate. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So they entered it, and the ten-year system they call it, the class, and the standard of learning and living changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Like my foreign language was English. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">This 1s why I have such an accent even now, because I learned in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , but for them learning languages...I mean unless you're in special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , was a bourgeois, so this we had only reading for comprehension where in the third year of my learning English I already had Shakespeare. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Lowered the standard. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But the subjects math and physics was a very high standard. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But the problem is immediately they developed , with political departments, and each student was called in and specially from the middle class and I was warned, unless you report on your friends, then you'll be expelled or you'll be fined. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Always threatened. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And then we saw our schoolmates suddenly taken in by . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They had special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> which they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">This installed fear in us. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My father, who was a government high official, was in business, suddenly became a laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I was accepted to <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They didn't want to take me to the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , but they were short in teachers, so they expec...uh accepted me to <span class="BUILDING">Institute</span> they call it, . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Means math and physics. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">After four months, I was called in. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I was told because you cannot get a stipendum (ph) because each student got a stipendum that he could sustain himself and could study. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You cannot because you're bourgeois but if you pay us six hundred rubles a month, you can continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">At that time my father earned only two hundred rubles, so naturally it was out for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Also we lived in fear that any time they will ship us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">One thing saved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Where our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was actually our <span class="BUILDING">condominium</span> , this was assigned each <span class="REGION">section</span> was assigned to different branch of government. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Our <span class="REGION">section</span> was assigned to rail authorities (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Means they could take over any <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for their workers, officials that they have chosen. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> were assigned to a Russian engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">When he came to take it over, my sis...my younger sister was present, and when he saw my sister...she was very beautiful and I1...little on the heavy side. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He said he cannot throw my sister out. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He put his name on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and my sister saved that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But it was very important, because we didn't have any other address and he lived on this one, so means they couldn't ship us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">We were not registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">See my older sister, she got married in '31, with a Pales...Palestinian from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who came for vacation and met her. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He was eleven years her senior. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He fell in love with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They were in a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> and he wanted to marry her. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The war broke out, so he gave a choice for my sister and he said, let's get engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">After the war I will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I will marry you. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Or if you want, I can marry you and you'll go with me back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">My sister had chosen to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My parents didn't approve. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">She was only eighteen years old, but she persuaded them being my grandmother and my mother's brother and the whole family who were Germans, lived at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , so she explained she has family there and she's not going just with her husband and they permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I'll never forget the day when she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">First of all, we were never separated, and like I explained we were just a year apart and my younger sister, like she would have a premonition. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She fainted and blood came out of her nose, like she would have known this was the last time that she sees her. (</span><span class="sentence" id="176">crying) So my sister left for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and my family was my parents, my younger sister and I. When the Russo (ph) German war broke out in '41 in June, where I worked they gave some Jews pink (ph) , Means permit to evacuate with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with this, and I presented it to my parents and my late father said, I didn't know that I raised a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You are not leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You're staying here but if you leave, you cannot come back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And my mother said, I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They are civilized people. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I don't believe the atrocities that we hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">This must be Russian propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We are staying put in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So, I was supposed to leave with my boyfriend, Alec (ph) Lamsdorf (ph), whose father was the chief engineer of the railroad authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Being he was Jewish, he couldn't become so-called . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">This was the highest official, but he has a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for himself on the <span class="DLF">line</span> from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so we could have escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He proposed, he would take his sister Tricia (ph), who by the way survived, and I would take my sister Teela, and we four will escape if our parents don't want. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But my father forbade me. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So when the Ru...Russo-German war broke out, first we had for a month the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The Hungarian army entered my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanistlawow</span> or . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The Hungarians were very were good to us and again, the same story. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They were supposed to requisition <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Being our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was like on the <span class="DLF">5th Avenue</span> , ours was supposed to requisition, be requisitioned, and came a Hungarian graf (ph), Count , with his adjutant. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">This time I saved the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He liked me, so he decided he's not going to take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , but he put his name on our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he started courting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I was eighteen only. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Flowers, and food was scarce so he ate in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so we would be able to have meal together. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Was even one situation unheard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Uh they had a spy, a Hungarian young man, extremely handsome, whom they used to draft in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They had spy uh housekeeper for one very important uh lord or something, and he spied for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So the count said that he has to invite him too. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">He'll come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but we should be very careful not to disclose that we are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And he told us about his uh deeds, what he had done and how he worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The Count told my father that he knows that our fate is sealed and it's very set. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They are going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He told my father I cannot save you all, but he would like to save me, so he proposed that I should embrace Christianity and he will marry me and he will smuggle me to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">My father expressed his gratitude and he said as a family he would like to stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He appreciates it and in a way he declined it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I couldn't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Not that I loved him but he...f was impressed. __ </span><span class="sentence" id="213">ten years old and I remember also the graf used to come with us where the Jews were assigned for slave labor with the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Among them was Baron Moore (ph) who was his friend before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Now he tried to protect him and to help him as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So even the Baron Moore talked to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Listen, now he's infatuated with your daughter, but you are wise not to let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He 1s the first-born. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">His mother would not tolerate it, anditmay bea ___ unto your daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You're very smart, but my father didn't explain to me, so I surprised, asked him why he didn't permit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He stated the reason that even I understood is right at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Meantime, this was...they were shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , to fight in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and the Germans entered. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">At that time, they shipped Russian, uh Hungarian Jews to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and when the Germans entered, they kept the Jews on . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">mill house</span> uh and they were kept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">When the Germans came, immediately they ordered us to wear the bands with the star, after age I think twelve, and they ordered all the Jews to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Specially the first to register, they ordered the teachers...the professional people. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So the Jewish , which took care of the Jewish life before the war, told them to register, so the Poles should be able to get jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They never returned from the meeting where they were called to a meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">This was the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Then we all had to register, according to the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and we specially from <span class="DLF">5th Avenue</span> , from the nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , were assigned as cleaning girls to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo building</span> to scrip, to scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> with our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We had to wear scrub brushes, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> , and we were assigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">One day when I was assigned there...it was just after a week my sister was assigned, my best friend Junior was assigned to work, and we...when once we came there we haduh ___ lady who was German, ethnic German, means born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and she was the supervisor. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">One day, a Gestapo man came and he pointed to me and to another girl to step out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The supervisor was once a neighbor of mine, because when we were young, we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German suburbs</span> ...was beautiful, out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and only two Jewish families lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Family Sweik (ph) who owned a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and me, and we. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">She knew us by sight because this was at least I would say to '35 so means I was uh twelve, thirteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">When he called me out, to step out and this girl...this girl was a refugee from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , Vita Sh , a beautiful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">She was sure that he wants to kill us, to shoot us so she said that we are good workers, decent workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We should be left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So he slapped her on the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">He didn't know that she's aunt of the two brothers, Mueller (ph) who are, were very sadistic and very big off...high officers in the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">He thought that she's Polish only. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So she advised me not...and he, so he told us to report to the <span class="INT_SPACE">private quarters</span> where they just moved in to clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">She advited...advised us not to report to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">She would protect us in order he should forget, because she still didn't trust him what he will do to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So a few days later, when we reported back, we had to clean the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and he spotted me through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and he called me in and this Vita Sh . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He started questioning me very nasty and he said he wants me to work, to be responsible for this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I'll never forget the picture of my sister with a group waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and crying because she thought this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">At that time I was responsible for cleaning this particu...his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and Vita Sh was responsible for cleaning another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Meanwhile responsible because then they sent from the Jewish community, uh from the , other Jewish girls to clean and Jewish women who are wives of the professionals whose husbands were taken away, they're responsible for furnishing the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And my sister still remained in the main <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You know, the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> were sitting there in the coal (ph) yard. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They brought them from the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> , from , to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the Gestapo, and they were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They were tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They were beaten, with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">My sister went to work, and they made a sandwich that my parents gave her when she went to work and for me, she dropped through the <span class="DLF">window</span> for them to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">A Gestapo officer noticed it, and he brought her down to there. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Since then I have never seen her. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">She started to cry, and there was Ukrainian police, and she told him that her sister is working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for Gestapo and and was his name, and he should notify me, who can talk that I can do something for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">This is a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Then they take her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So there were Gestapo who took me out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , he was in charge and when I came crying he told me I should go and the one who was in charge, maybe he will listen to me, and I forgot in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we were told not to wear the armbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">When he saw me, and I told him, explained the reason of my coming, he said so she's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So you're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And he yelled at me...how did you dare to come without a band. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I'll shoot you too. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Actually the penalty was to be shot if somebody didn't with band. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He let me go...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The Gestapo, how cruel he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He kept telling me and his fiance who came to live with him who was from and she took a liking to me, that they took only my sister for labor because it was harvest time and they were short in field hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">After fall, they will release her. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I had to bring the news to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Naturally it was a terrible shock and my mother tried to comfort me because I was very close to my sister, and I tried to comfort my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">My mother was only forty years old and from red hair she had, she became white within a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And we still believed...we clung to the hope that my sister will come back after the wa...the harvest. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Meantime we saw shooting on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , random shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They took the Jews and to work on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They used to catch them, you know, and then to dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> or to work at <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and then sometimes they used to throw them into the river and Russians erected many monuments so they took the Jews to destroy the monuments, and many of them were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">This was going on till around, till September, and I still work at that time by this Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Then we were told that we will have to leave our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and to move to a section which was designated as ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">This was the poorest section of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Being...again we lived like on the <span class="DLF">5th Avenue</span> , my parents secured immediately an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the future <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and the always optimist Jew that we hoped war will end before we'll have to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We transferred our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We still kept only a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> , the essential thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and on...while we lived on 35, with hope that we'll maybe not have to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Then suddenly, on , October the 12th, we were in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which almost was bare and it was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Only the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and some utensils. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We heard terrible commotion and noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I went out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and I saw a lot of Gestapo and Ukrainian police. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We knew something is brewing, something bad is going...will happen, but neither what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We thought that maybe now they will gather the Jewish men like have done with the Hungarian men that they brought to us, to break us economically so means only the men are in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So my mother decided to hide my father in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">attics</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Each <span class="BUILDING">condominium</span> , <span class="BUILDING">condominium</span> had it's own part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and it's own part in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , so we have hidden my father on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My mother got the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And after an hour, my mother's cousin who lived...also owned a condominium in this <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> came and said look, it's very unsafe to stay in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Let's all go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and let's hide there, and this was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like a <span class="DLF">facade</span> (ph)...many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">She thought it's safe there. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I really never disobeyed my mother because we were raised to uh obey our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I refused to go with her down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> with the family and other Jewish neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Only one neighbor, Mrs. Pollack (ph), who was an old lady, seventy-five, something...she had, she had also hidden her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">She decided to stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">My reasoning was they will come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They will see empty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They will not enter the last <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">This 1s how my reasoning went, and I refused to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I stayed with her in the, in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We heard...we heard cries. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We heard noise, but we didn't know from where it's coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">By noon, my neighbor's son knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , Rister (ph), and he said your mother would like you very much to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Please don't be stubborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Again, the same story. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I don't know why I was so stubborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I can't explain to today. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I refused to come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Towards evening it come down...some...Mrs. Pollack and I decided to venture in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and to find out what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Our Christian neighbors said, you are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They took everybody from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They loaded them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they took them to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was a terrible shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I didn't know how to act. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But I still didn't suspect that this was for killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">This was the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So I thought maybe this is the gathering place, so now I have somehow to get my father out and to join my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Finally I managed with the neighbor's help, to get him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Before we managed to go, my neighbor, Mrs. Reifter (ph), with her husband and children, came . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Straight hair pulled down and from her we found out what happened...that they took them to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">My mother was crying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> when she saw the direction, and she said they're taking us to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Why didn't I listen to Malia. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">My parents called me Malia. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">At the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> ...first of all they told them to sit down in rows and they sent Jewish girls, young girls, to pick up all the jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And there was a board and they shot...even if people were killed or not, they fell to the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They collected thirty thousand Jews on this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">My mother was with her cousin and they took my mother's cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So the cousin said to my mother, I can't witness this. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So my mother said you are right. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Let's move closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We'll be spared to witness the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Let's be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">She didn't know that when it became dark, the Gestapo announced whoever is alive can go back to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But my mother was not there anymore to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So this how my sister and my mother were gone. (</span><span class="sentence" id="347">crying) My father and I remained <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And now they shot fifteen thousand Jews on this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">This was . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">This was my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">On the Jewish calendar, . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Naturally I will never now celebrate on my birthday on the Jew calendar and so immediately from my family, my father and I was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Now we had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">For two people we couldn't have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They assigned ten people per <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">My mother had a step-sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Her name was Clara Hoot (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Actually I would say she was poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They were not so close, but the goodness and the best was coming out and there were bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">She lived where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was supposed to be, so she approached my father and said, you're only two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Why should you be assigned to strangers? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We are five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We have only a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We'll take you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And she was to me like a mother. (</span><span class="sentence" id="366">crying) Till today, you know, I felt so guilty that we didn't treat them like really aunt should be treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">How good she was, and we stayed with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Her husband maked tops of the shoes and this was very good because the Germans liked boots so there was a German cobbler who used to bring the materials he should make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">For this he got food, so he was also sustaining us, helping us with food where others were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Many of my schoolmates, rich people, wealthy people...I will never forget the face, for example, from one other , only child, so spoiled...his father was the head of the Juden (ph), uh Jewish _,, not Juden...and laying on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The next day from hunger water came out, and this the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">You saw, you knew the people starving to death, and you couldn't even share and give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So my father learned that if he 1s assigned as a slave laborer out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , at least he will have the chance to barter clothes for food, whatever...bread was really very hard to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So with his connections, he was able to get a job on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> as as slave worker, and then he tried for me to get a job too, because my father said, being we two are left, let's not ever separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Let's always be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Meantime my uncle died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">My Uncle Dabbie Toot (ph), he died a natural death. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">His son, Jacob, was taking . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It's forced labor . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">His daughter was taken away from the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">She was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">They collected hundred of beautiful...hundred beautiful Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So only my Aunt Clara, her daughter Pepi (ph) who's named like my sister Pepi (ph), and the oldest son who also got the job to make tops for the German cobbler Gross (ph)... remember his name...he remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And one day my father said to me, you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We have to escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">My father had so-called iron (ph) luck (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Spoke Polish well. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So he decided that we'll try to get to the <span class="REGION">Iron side</span> and maybe some of his friends will help us or to or will harbor us, will help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We didn't think farther, just first to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So he dressed himself with few suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He divided the money that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He gave me some few thousand and we were supposed to go out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and try our luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And he said let me go first. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">If I succeed, then you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">After five minutes he came back, beaten up by the Ukrainian police. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Luckily he had the money, because if not he would be shot, but they took away his suits and the money and they pushed him back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So our escape was foiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Meantime they will have killings in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">You know, they assigned the Jews, classified the Jews, just to find excuse for each killing which they call an aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">First were the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Then were all the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Then were people who were sick, people who couldn't work, so was A, B, C classification. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">One day we got classification of A - means we don't have to be afraid because we are working, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">One day we saw through the <span class="DLF">window</span> aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Aktion was...there was no secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Openly, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they digged ditches and they shot on the spot, so everybody had seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It's not like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , we didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We didn't have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They just had done it first on the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> , but then when there's no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> anymore, they had done it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was life, in between the killings, going on semi-normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We hoped this is the end, especially when Roosevelt entered the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We thought we will be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Everybody just tried to live another day with the hope that they would survive, and one day...this was before my father obtained for me also uh a labor card that I can work on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> ...again we heard rumors that there's to be another killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">My cousin Pepi worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> was on making slippers for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Those usually workers were excused from aktion, from killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">My poor Aunt Clara tells me, come with me...we'll be there safe because my father was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">At that time it was safe to be out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when killing was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My other cousin, my cousin was out by the German who lived in , where he made, you know, the boots, so she said to me, come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We'll be safe in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> because they didn't touch before the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Again my premonition. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I said Aunt Clara, I don't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">You have an old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">You have an old <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Let's hide under where the firewood is kept and let's crawl under this. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We'll cover it with the firewood and they will not find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">My Aunt Clara said said you're a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It's safer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Again, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="436">She was so good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">She was like mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Why I didn't listen to her...I remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I crawled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I have hid myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">She went to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">On this day they took everybody from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">There was no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">This was the first time they shipped them to to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So only my father, my cousin and I were left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So my father obtained for me a permit to work, a working card to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and he told me if should ever come the time that we'll be separated and we are not in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> to be sent to be gassed, let's jump from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death train</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">What more can happen to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Let's run for our life, and within three weeks to get in touch with the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> which we means left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if we are not in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , and get united again. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It was in October '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I had high temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I couldn't go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">My father closed me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with the lock <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Even...I had high temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I was delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I heard noises. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I knew another killing 1s going on, so I crawled again in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> where I have hidden myself before, hoped that my father is safe because he is out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And nothing will happen and usually when it was dark they let in the workers from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the slave workers in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">It's dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Meantime they came to look in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with the dog, and the Germans said, is here, rouse (ph), and they leaved uh left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So I was so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I said at least my father is safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">When it's dark he will return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we will be united. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It's night. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">My father is not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So I decided, sick or not sick, I have to go next day to work...you see, because we used to march, and they guarded us with the Ukrainian police to work actually like prisoners, and I'll find out what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Before even I came to work, my Christian acquaintance was standing behind the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and she said, don't look for your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They took all the Jews from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to be shipped to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So I somehow, knowing my father I knew he will do everything not to let himself be shipped to the gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And meantime what I didn't mention, once when there was such killing and we knew we all had Cate...Category A means we're exempt from shooting, we stayed in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">At that time my Aunt Clara was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Her daughter Pepi was alive, my father and I. And the brother opened our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We presented our cards and they said, rouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They always ignored it. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We were fools. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We thought that they will respect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">He recognized me from the days when I was assigned to the private apartment because he had that sadistic pleasure when I went to work to knock at the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I was very afraid of him because he known, was known as a sadist, and this give him a pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So I guess in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when he came to take us out for shooting, he pushed me <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">He recognized me through the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So I had the presence of my uh mind that I'm...and I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He is my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I cannot let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So they didn't believe me because my father was very young looking so they were two brothers - Willie and Hans (ph), so one tried to test me so with his uh what...rubber what they had...uh not gun...oh how you call tt... ( )...he hit my father very hard and I saw tears from my father's eyes, so I started to cry bitterly. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">This convinced them that this is my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So they permitted him to go with me, and then I said on my aunt, this is my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I will never know why they let me go, but they let go. . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">When it was day of trial in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I was called as a witness, and I have problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">To go to testify because I witnessed many killings, or because he recognized me, not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And I have chosen not to go but I'll send somebody else, and unfortunately she didn't know the facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And the facts were after they let us go, through my <span class="DLF">window</span> I saw where was the , the <span class="BUILDING">gathering place</span> already where they took for killing, and I saw Willie shot my neighbor, Mrs. Leichter (ph) who came from the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> who told me what happened at the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">She was just walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So it was willful killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It was not that she was caught in the aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">This kind of guy he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So maybe I was destined to live, and this what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So coming back to this, when I lost my father, I was left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">The German shoemaker kept my cousin and he kept him in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ...he should work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">While I was working as a slave labor on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , every Jew or Jewess was not _— because we had the and we had to work with our bare hands to wash the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> and scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">There was employed a carpenter, a by the name Abraham...uh Edmond Abraham Ovitch (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He was from , half hour away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Stanistlawow</span> where there was a big concentration of and they were considered by Hitler, by the Germans, as foreigners because they were Turkish descendants from <span class="COUNTRY">Crimea</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Mostly they were farmers or army men. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And he worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">He offered me...when my father was still alive...to take me and to help me and to harbor me. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He lived with his mother, sister-in-law and a baby and he said he will help me and he told me that he helped ten other, other Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I will tell you what happened, or maybe I should tell you right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I was the only one who who didn't blend into the Slavic population because I don't have the high Slavic cheekbones and my eyes were considered very Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">The other girls were all typical so-called Aryan looks, blonde, blue eyes and from the eleven, I am the only one who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Because I knew that I don't look Slavic, I could pass somehow as a German girl so I was advised to work in the lion's den so I worked for German companies. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I will explain later what I have done, and they were so sure that they would not be recognized so they worked in <span class="BUILDING">Polish companies</span> and normally they were beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They were approached by Poles to date, and when they refused...maybe they said it jokingly...you must be a Jewish...and the sudden fear in their eyes gave them out and the Poles denounced them. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I was the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So one day he propo...offered me this while still my father was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But he told me that he cannot harbor my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">When my father was gone, I waited three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I didn't hear from him, so I thought he didn't succeed to jump from the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and poor one (ph), he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So one day he came and he told me according to my information, they will...they last two thousand Jews who were left at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from one time hundred thousand Jews, we were forty thousand Jews and they used to bring in Jews from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">What, at one time we were a hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Only two thousand remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So he told me that from here's information that now they will finish us all off, and he would advise me not to go back to go back with the column of slave workers, back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...only after work, he will arrange that I will be able to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and the next day after work will dispose of my and to go to with him to .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  We have to stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We need to change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We're rolling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  So Edmund Abraham Ovitch, he told me to stay, that I shouldn't go back, and I slept on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the Chief . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">After the War, I found out how he arranged it, and this proved to me how sincere and honest he is, that he really wants to save my life and after work I dropped my arm band with my star carelessly on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> because if they would find it they would search for the one who threw it away, and I boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to , half hour ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But I didn't want to sit next to Mundig because I felt if I'm caught, why should he loose his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So I sat by myself and there were workers, maybe about thirty, coming back from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They all knew me because if I should present it because like all white and one . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">| was there with the arm band so they saw me everyday so they knew me, and like in every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the police came and the German police came. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">On every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a Gestapo police, checked the passengers. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">When I...before they were supposed to approach me I must have been in terrible fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I can't explain why the workers gave me a sign with their eyes not to fear, that they will not give me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Where they were so eager to denounce others, I was destined to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And the police came. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I didn't have any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I was afraid, but the German police sat next to me and discussed the weather, how beautiful it is, and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So safely I arrived to Mundig's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">His mother was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I don't blame her, because I endangered her and the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">On top of it without any reward. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I didn't have even money to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">She resented and she made it clear to me, so the son promised her that whenever he can find for me a safe haven, I will leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">As a matter of face, even she refused me the meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Again I don't blame because it was very hard to get food, so the son, to make sure that I am eating, demanded that I should eat with him the dinner together. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But I would like to go back to a few scenes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that I omitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I think it's very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">You see, the Germans, when their wives came to visit them from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , their pleasure was to show the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like we'll be animals in the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> and they used to take them and parade them through the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So one day parading them and looking at them, at us Jews like animals, one Jew...I forgot his last name...Joseph...by the way, he's alive...he's now in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ...when they were gaping at us, he spate on the Germans and run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Immediately the Gestapo came to the Juden___ and they gave, and at that time the president of Juden____— was Goldstein, and he gave an order to line up uh the Jewish orderlings (ph), means the Jewish police, and every ten was singled out to step out and he was hanged, but he needed the rope to hang them, so he said first that the Juden , the president should decide which ones will step out. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">He said I cannot do it, Mr. Goldstein said. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I'm not God. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I will not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He should bring rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He didn't want to bring rope, so they sent somebody else and they hanged the head of the Juden , Mr. Goldstein with every ten police...uh Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">One of them married my schoolmate, Eddie Fraley (ph), and he, when they hanged him, the rope broke down and he escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">They let him escape because they thought that they will get him another time. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But they didn't and actually he escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">He looked very much like a gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">He escaped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> he was one of the chief officers from the underground . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He survived with my schoolmate. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They live now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The second incident was....
QUESTION:  How many were killed altogether?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Hundred (ph), and they were hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">This wasn't over for the whole week, for everyone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The poor because it was a friend or a relative, and the stench...1f we do something, you know, to show us they punish. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Not enough that they were shooting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They were hanging...after a a week, they removed them, and you know, they couldn't find the commandant, uh a Jew to be a commandant of the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">They wanted a hi...a Polish officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">They wanted that he should have been a pol...an army officer, so they brought a Kariate from , whose family was in . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they gave him a Jewish name, uh a Mr. , and after that he left by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">He joined his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">This also I found out after I escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from, uh from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mundig</span> I called him, this Abraham Mundig, Abraham Ovitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Now when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I was left alone and it was cold...I didn't have any firewood. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Some of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was in uh in a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , so I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and I wanted with a hammer to break into firewood but I wasn't handy so I just had to break it. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I cut myself next to my ankle and I was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Later sets uh set in puss (ph) but I couldn't do anything because no doctors, no medication and this how I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Again, why I didn't die on gangrene and when it was cured, it's again a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mundig</span> , being I was persona non gratia, parents didn't want...my...uh his mother didn't want me, I couldn't stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So I I told Mundig...that uh I cannot stay there, so he found me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide by a Ukrainian peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Ukrainian peasant had beautiful daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">A lot of Ukrainian militiamen used to come to visit her, and every time I had to run in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and to hide between the hay, and I said this is not the life for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I don't want to be hidden there. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But while, while I was in a month later, Edmund Abraham Ovitch told me have to tell you some very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And brace yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Your father jumped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> by prying off the boards from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , although they were pressed like sardines, and he lifted the board and he asked who would like to jump with him, because more than that cannot be to let themselves down from the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and run for their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Only one girl...she was from ...1 don't know her name...my age...wanted to go with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I guess the rest didn't want to separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Sometimes there were families together. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They wanted to die together. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">My father let themselves down. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">He got only bruised knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">The girl was not harmed at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He walked to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which was half-hour walking distance where I was in and he entered a Ukrainian peasant's house. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">There was only a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Her husband was still in the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">She...1t was harvest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">She needed field hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Without questioning my father, she took in my father and the girl, the girl posing as a daughter of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He tried to get in touch with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">He couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">He didn't get any response. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He couldn't live with the thought that his sheltered daughter 1s alone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">He decided to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which is certain death penalty for any Jew who boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to look for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was an architect, a Ukrainian who used to buy lumber from my father, who was wined and dined in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Without any reward he went to the Gestapo...each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I told you was a and a Gestapo...and said I know this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">This is Dabbie Petranka. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">He's a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They took him off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They brought him to the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> on where they gathered the Jews already to be shipped to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">My father probably tried to get in touch with me, but I was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So I'm alive, but my father was killed. (</span><span class="sentence" id="614">crying) So this 1s my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So when I didn't want to stay by the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , by Ukrainian farmer, Mundig said to me, I'll get you a false labor certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You should have some document. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">His friend, a big anti-Semite that off-hand I don't remember his name...in my book that I am writing which will be published in November...I, at that time I still remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I don't remember now. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I know only that he was a student, second <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which was known for the biggest anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">He was the director of , scrap iron (ph) and it was very important during the War because they needed it, so he gave me a certificate that I'm employed in his company under assumed name. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Now I had to choose my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">My actually name was Amalia Petrankia but I'm not Jewish and not German, but everything was very important to be able to blend into the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">First impression's very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">My "r" is a French and German, but not a Slavic, and this was very dangerous, so I picked the name Felicita (ph) which means in Latin black, felicita and I picked the name of Mewycheski who was my beloved uh writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You see we didn't have heros baseball, basketball, ballerinas...we had writers, and she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> (ph) so he put...he made a certificate that I am Mewycheski, Felicita. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I was careful to keep my birthdate, because when you are under stress, this is the first thing that you forget...dates...and I gave my real...only my birthplace was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , and now I became Felicita Mewycheski. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">With this, Mundig took me to where I thought being it's a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">metropolitan city</span> , I will be able to get lost there. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">He took me to his cousin's, first cousin's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was just a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Turn out his cousin was the king of the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , the king of the underworld. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And they had only two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">This was a terrible experience at that time for me, a sheltered child. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He slept with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> ...uh mistress on one. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I was supposed to sleep with Edmund on the other, and there were terrible, provocative remarks from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Mundig understood it's not for me, so he found me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> ...this was...you see wives of Polish officers unable to be able to sustain themselves...they rented one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where they put <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and this is where Poles who traveled slept because the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> were only for Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">How little did I know that this is the day when they're closing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in and they were searching in every <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> for Jews who may have escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And after the curfew...the curfew was ten o'clock...two Ukrainian police are coming to this <span class="BUILDING">woman's house</span> and they with flashlight...you know...putting into our eyes, questioning everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They started with the two Polish girls but he didn't have any doubt that they are Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">There's a woman with a child and I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">One Ukrainian was busy with this woman and the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I overheard...she had baptismal papers but from '37. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">She was a wife of a Christian judge, but she was converted, so they considered her Jewish because it was '37 and they took her away with the little girl who was born already a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The one Ukrainian asked me questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He said you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Prove to me you are not. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I, a product of <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew kindergarten</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> ...on top of it we had a maid, a Jewish orphan...so I was never exposed to and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So he told me to get dressed and he's bringing me to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">On the way he tried to persuade me that, to admit that I am Jewish and he will let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">How could I trust him? </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I thought he wants to have an easy job and to come, she admit it and, you know if somebody escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was even worse punishment...they used to let the dogs to tear them to pieces or they used to bill uh beat up to pulp. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">It was a terrible death, so when finally I reached the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the steps of the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo building</span> , I didn't have what to loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So I said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And then I became very arrogant. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">You know, Jude (ph)... was what, eighteen years old...I said go ahead...you spilled a lot of Jewish blood you have on your hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">There's a saying in Polish...go ahead...go...tell them I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He looked at me and start calling me with strong epithets, insulting me, and he said to me, go. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I thought he was joking. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He said go, but I don't want to see you anymore in because if I recognize you, I'll shoot you myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">How did I have the guts? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">To go after curfew so another one will get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I said how can I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="666">He said, OK...what do you want now...and yelling...I said you should bring me back to the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">He said no, I'll bring you back to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">At that ti...at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> was a lot of police. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">A lot of police, looking for for Jews and for black marketeers so imagine - it was so dangerous for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">How I survived the night...it's another miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">In the morning I went to the woman where my belongings were there and at this <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> and I said you see, I'm not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">They let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">She said I don't care if you are or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Take your things and get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Where do I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So I decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">This is one corner of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to another corner of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , this who was my father's boss, lived with his wife and a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They was very good friends of my parents...even they were invited to the wedding of my older sister, and I thought so I don't know if they will extend their help or hand and help me but somehow I felt they will not give me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And being he was an aristocratic family, I knew they would be in the telephone book. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I will find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">In order to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ...we didn't have straight connections...I had to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">L was little...how little I knew... was very important for Jews who try to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , so there was a lot of police. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">A lot of police. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Past curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I couldn't sleep on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">What do I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="689">There was a girl who had a <span class="BUILDING">newspaper stand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I approached her. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I started conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">She liked me, and I said look, what should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I don't want to live on this <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ...like it's inconvenience, not that it was dangerous for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And what should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="695">She said you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Soon I'll finish my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I live next to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I will take you for the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I was so grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">She didn't suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">In the morning, I'm on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">A young man, very well dressed _is following me. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Well, I didn't like, everybody, you know, took off their hat to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">He was too young to be so prominent, so at uh I got idea I will go to the ladies room. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">No man would dare to follow me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I'm in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ladies room</span> ...I see his shoes in the main <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where each <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I knew I'm finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So I come out on the aggressive side, and I said how did you dare to follow me. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Imagine what guts I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">How did you dare to...what kind of upbringing do you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="712">This put him in the defense and he was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He didn't expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">He thought he'll find me timid with fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So he questioned me and I told him...I said I will tell you my name and I'll introduce myself if you, you'll introduce yourself to me first. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I said I have an aunt who is very sick in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I want to go to her to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">He obtained for me the ticket railroad ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Was a long <span class="DLF">line</span> and he sitted me in his <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> like he would feel guilty that maybe I suspect that he's police and he wanted to cover up for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">We had to pass through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="723"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> again police, and they light the flashlight into you eye, and the fear in my eyes and the Gestapo man said to me, why is your voice shivering so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And he saw the fear in my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">What could I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I'm able if I don't understand German because you see mostly only Germ...Jews understood German. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Mostly Poles from the knew French but not so well German. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Through interpreter I said I wonder if you two will travel forty-eight hours, if you wouldn't be tired, if your voice would not shiver. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">He took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">He left so the Polish woman who sit next to me, she said, you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">He took you for a Jew, she's telling me. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And this was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Again another episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">At that time on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , I saw a lot of Polish police and a Gestapo with the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But they were not searching for Jews anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">They are looking for Poles without valid, valid Polish working papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Means papers that they won't, don't work for the war, German war industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The Polish police recognized me immediately and they approached me, and they said you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">What you are doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So naturally I was on the defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I said how do you dare to insult me? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Why do you do it to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">If you are not Jewish...he started to again to question me from their New Testament. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So they marked me and they said hah. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">He will finish you off, pointing to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I was resigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I said my <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I felt so alive, and I said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So I tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">But if not, I will join you and my parents and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Enough is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">You know, I felt like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I felt light*hearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I accepted it, and my feet were like glued to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">The Gestapo man checked all other papers, then my turn came and the Polish police told him that I'm a Jewish, a Jewess. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I had a bag in my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He requested...he took....told the police to hand him over the bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">He looked in the bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I don't know what he looked for. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">He looked me up and down and he said to me why I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I told the same story. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I'm a poor girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">My aunt is very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">She lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">She sent for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Through interpreter naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Where does she live? </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I have never...I never was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , but like here, every time almost has <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I said the

class="sentence" id="775">I didn't believe my ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You know, when a person is so resigned...I was ready to get uh you know, a shot...to be shot from the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">He wants me to move, andhe_ ___ sent off the dog in the

class="sentence" id="782">Kiss his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">He let you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I, we don't know why, in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And like a robot I start moving till I left the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I didn't believe that I will leave it alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Why he let me go I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">When I left the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , now where should I go now? </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It was Christmas Eve. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So inquired about some...again a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> who will take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And I was told one _ has aroom where he rents <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">He gave me the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I came there and the said you see all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> are taken unless somebody offers to take you in, which with a sardonic smile, vulgar smile. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And there was a woman, little older than I. I noticed the hair was re...painted red, not her natural, with dark eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And she offered to take me into her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Immediately she recognized me that I'm Jewish and I recognize her. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">It turned out she was a seamstress from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> (ph) who escaped and now she tried her luck as a gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">What the night was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">You know what was going on on other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I had wonderful school of life (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="801">She gave me a sign not to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Only when we were in the <span class="DLF">park</span> we spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I told her who I am and she told me...she shared with me the bread that she bought on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and I told her I am...the only chance I have...let me look up . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">We went to the telephone book. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I found his address. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I came over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">His wife, Kashimira (ph), opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">When she saw me, she couldn't believe her eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">She thought it's a ghost, and she closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Then she opened it again and she pulled me in, and I said I am Amalia Petranka, David's daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">She started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">She embraced me and she said look, I didn't recognize you. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Let's see if my husband will recognize you. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">If he doesn't, so maybe we can harbor you for a while till we'll find something for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Her husband came. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">She told him who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">So he said, I hate Jews, but for the daughter of David Petranka, I'll do every thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Let's see what we can do for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Now this was the high life of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Every night <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , different companies, and being she was Armenian...again the Germans considered her a foreigner and she lived in a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German neighborhood</span> , so she had two little girls and she had a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">She said to me you'll sleep with the girls and you'll...I'll tell the maids that you are the new governess for the children, and I stayed for three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And they found for me in the newspaper a job as a housemaid to a , to Germans who had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And she gave me advice, to work for Germans because this is safer and they will not recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I got the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">The Germans liked me because they got a maid, you know, from...a peasant girl who didn't understand German. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">They treated me quite good. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They thought that I am Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I developed here . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">It was abscessed with puss. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So the Germans said it's not proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We'll bring you to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I am a Jew, no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">How could they enter a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and I didn't have uh the social card from uh from here like Medicare or some...I didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">But he was a big shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">He arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">They accepted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">How little I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Before the operation, a priest comes for confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I didn't know how and what. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So he started talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So he said I see you're from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">You're from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landberg</span> (ph) and I am special accent in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So he said how about...and now he wanted I should confess. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I said, Father, how about if you'll sing for me a song, a very famous song just from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">This changed the mood, and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But I was afraid after I will wake up or during when they give me anesthesia, I may spill who I am because usually what you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I spotted a nurse who looked to me Jewish and I said look, please, watch over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Why, she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Because I'm Jewish and you're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Not I'm not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I said I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And I showed her my leg, which was already with gangrene and I developed lice last day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I couldn't get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I said help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And she did help. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So she wouldn't do it if she wouldn't be Jewish masquerading. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And also, imagine how you can control your mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Before even I woke up, they looked for my nightgown and I was able to point where it is hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Meantime, Edmund came to visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">There, next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to me was laying a Polish peasant girl by the . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">She liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">She worked for a <span class="BUILDING">German casino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Means they were employees, bookkeepers, everything for oil, from the oil company sent from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Because they were by themselves, they had a <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> , like a club where they lived, dined and then they went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kashimira</span> , can you get me a job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I thought if it's a German place, the Polish police doesn't have any access. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Where they used to comb the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="REGION">Polish sections</span> searching for Jews and I will have some security and a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And one day a girl by the name Katia (ph)...I forgot her last name...came to visit Kashia, so this . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Kashia said, you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">You're like each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I notice you are educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">She's educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">You're alike. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">She's Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Kashia started talking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">She recognized immediately that I am Jewish and I recognized that she's Jewish, so she started, tried to stay away. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So this chambermaid Kashia said to me, I thought you liked each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">How come you dislike each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I couldn't tell her. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">We came to the <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">She obtained for me the job and I started as a chambermaid. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I had to clean eight <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , to kindle their fire and for this I have...she took me into their <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and this, how I could stay and was safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">One day this Katia Ukrainian comes to me and she says look...at that time she had a job as the chief manager of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , which was wonderful because she got food. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">She...and because of it she got a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">She said come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I want to discuss with you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I said OK Katia, what is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I came to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">She said look, you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I am Jewish, and there is another Jewish girl, Soshia (ph) who doesn't sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">She sleeps <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but its very dangerous for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Because you are the last one, you are the one who has to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And she told me she was a medical student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lamburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="897">She comes from the and her husband's friends who who was a communist and was presently in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , gave her the paper as Ukrainian, a Ukrainian, and this is how she's surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So I said Katia, you're right. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">By right I should leave, but I don't have a scrape of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Let me get some documents and I promise you that I will leave, but again when you have to do with nice people, when Soshia who was the daughter of a lawyer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lamburg</span> , a little bit older than I...she said I'm staying anyhow outside the <span class="BUILDING">theat</span> ...uh <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I will go first. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And then my boss came to me and he says, he said you know, how comes you don't have an ID. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">How come Anna cannot feed you because not having an ID you don't have any ration cards? </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So I had to apply. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I wrote a letter to Mundig and I said I need baptismal papers because this is how you applied for ID. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Dear Mundig, bless his sole...he went to a Ukrainian priest, Catholic priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So I got my baptismal paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I'm Roman Catholic, but the baptismal paper, the stamp was for <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian church</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">When I gave the application to the police, they came looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Who am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="911">What a contradiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And they call it in the German and they summoned me to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Now I was thinking what can I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Not to report to police means I have to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Where do I run again without papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">To report, they will catch me and I'm gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So then he said...I looked very young, younger for my age than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I was always very petite. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I had two braids and I prayed to God, the woman who'll investigate me should me an old maid or old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Somehow they had some compassion for children, for young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And I came there and she saw me...she said you know what, your priest got drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Look what the nonsense he wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Write for another baptismal paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But not I'm at fault, only this. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I have done it, so Mundig sent me another with the stamp Roman Catholic and this I got legitimate ID from the police which meant a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">No money could buy it, because this, you know, the first thing when they caught a Jew, they checked with the police, then they check with the parish, so I was...because of it I was able to get a labor card and I was able to rep...get a card, you know, from uh , you know, to get health, health care. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">While I worked there, meantime came the Jewess from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> who helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">She learned I'm there, and she cried...she doesn't have a piece of paper and they're searching...she worked, she worked for a seamstress who gladly kept her for food for her labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But she didn't have any paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Nothing can get . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I give her my piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Not the ID still didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Only Felecita Mewychesk1. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Luckily this wasn't the time of computers because immediately we both would be caught, but I didn't think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">| knew I have to save her. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">When you're young, you don't think. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And in <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> , 1n this was one . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">His mother was Jewish descendent. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">His grandfather was Jewish. . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">He recognized me immediately, and one day he told me I'll have to report to his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I said I don't have to report because Poles were forbidden to socialize with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">He insisted with a threatening voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I knew I don't have a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">He presented me with a pic...a picture, a photo of a Jew and he said to me, this is my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I thought he wants to provoke me. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I thought he is from the Gestapo because each unit has also each <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I said what do you want for my life? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">If you know I'm Jewish, why didn't you report me to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">He says cut it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I want to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I want to save you. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">First of all, you cannot work here. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">You don't blend in. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">You're not a chambermaid with the coarse white features and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">You must get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I said how can I get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I need a <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">It was hard to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and even...and I need a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And no job will pay me for be able to pay rent and to sustain myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">He said don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I will see what I can do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">He knew an architect, a very big engineer from the railroad authority, , ., </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Whose brother was the Commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> while Hitler was shot there. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">The Chief Commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">He spoke to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">He said, you know many <span class="BUILDING">construction firms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I would like you to find a job for my fri...my Polish who uh Polish acquaintance who is working in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I am now, and he obtained for me a job in a <span class="BUILDING">construction firm</span> , but while I was in <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> , they decided, you know, the director of the <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> was a a a brother of the secretary of Hans Frank and the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And he used to get his meals from the <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I was the one selected to bring the meals, but to enter it I was checked and double checked and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I didn't have the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I couldn't get out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Luckily, with this scrap of paper...before I had my ID, they let me through and I used to bring the meals to the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">With all the police guarding and everything, so he found for me a job and , aconstruction firm which was located in and employed slave workers from __, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And I...when I worked there, I said my goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I'm open now. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I...maybe I can help the Jews by supplying them bread, maybe potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">So I asked my boss, Wilhelm Langerd (ph) if he will permit me to go with him on the , means where they were working there, not in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and just to see how it's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">He thought that I'm going for the gold, because he used to get gold from the Jews who were able to buy out their way not to work so hard only in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And one day he was in good mood and he took me to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">The secretary was Doctor Leibermann (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="986">He was a ref...a German Jew who was . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">He introduced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">This is our secretary, Felecita Mewycheski and Dr. Leibermann looking at me said, you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Our secretary looks complete like my sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So I couldn't go there any more, and the <span class="DLF">door door</span> was closed for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">While I was working there they brought Czech and Slavic Jews in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I...the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Down were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">How I as a Jewess could take the screams and the cries for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">At that time was also in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> a Polish mining engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">He was a terrible anti-Semite and I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> filled up with water and went down to hand the water to the uh...they had the little <span class="DLF">windows</span> which were . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">They were guarded by Ukrainian police with the bayonets. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">The police approached me and said what, do you want to be killed to and threw the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">With a broken heart I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and the mining engineer, with this smirk on his face tells me...Miss Felecita, what will you be after the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Then I knew he recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I played dumb and I told him how do I know who I'll be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">How do I know whom I'll marry after the war, but I have to go ahead of time, after the war, when the war ended, on the <span class="DLF">bus stop</span> where I used to board my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> ...here was standing , the engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">He comes over to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">He said, Miss Felecita. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I recognize you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">At that time you gave yourself away, but I didn't have the heart to give you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I hated Jews, but I didn't have the heart to give you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Another incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Well, when I was working for this Wilhelm Langerd, I was masquerading as Miss Felecita Mewycheski. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Ins was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">a very elegant family, a widow and a sister by the name mewycheski, to whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> used to come my boss, the Nazi, the German, Mr. Wilhelm Langerd, and she, hearing that this Mewycheski must be family, insisted on meeting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">When finally I couldn't avoid it, I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Sure enough that she will recognize and it's my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I came over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">She pulled me all my face on all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> and there she looked at me and she asked me who I am and I had a story that I prepared who my father and so what, and she said you know you are not from the main <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">You must be from the branch of Mewycheskis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lamberg</span> and insisted that I should move in, because she felt responsible for a young girl to live on her own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Miracle again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Another miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Well works till there by Mr. Langerd, the company paid five per capita for every Jew for slave work to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">In was Gestapo Miller (ph), a known sadist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Tall, slim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">With a stick in his hand he used to walk, and at at will, at random he used to kill, shoot at the Jews who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">| heard of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">One day whom do I see in the frame of the por...of the <span class="DLF">door</span> - it was him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Then I had to think fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Did he come for me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He's too big to come for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">He could have sent somebody else, but I couldn't take off my eyes from the two German Shepherds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">They were known that used to just to tear up Jews to pieces, so my eyes were glued. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">He approached the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , and he said, you don't have to fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">My dogs will smell a Jew a mile away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">So means you are not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">What luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And then he stated the reason why he came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I was never a secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I took humanities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">I was supposed to study medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I didn't know any secretarial work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">When this that commanded me to this guy, he told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">After a month my boss told me, you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I admire you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">How come you grasp so fast, like a Jewess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Another incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">One day he tells me, how come that you have such Semitic eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">What answer do I give him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">To deny? </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I will blush. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I'll give myself away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Said, was probably nonchalantly, probably my grandmother was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">No one would admit because till third generation they were considered Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">He thought that it was such a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">He burst out laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">This was only incident in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Why I bring them out...we are accused that you went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">It's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">But there were many incidents and you had to be lucky not to be caught, or killed because I was caught many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Not to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">One more would have, I would have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">When the Russians were moving close, the front, they didn't have enough...the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Many who built for war in say like the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , railroad, toward the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> were excused for active service in German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Towards the end they needed everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">So they also were drafted the workers, the German who worked for company as carpenters and other jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So my boss sent me , which was a part of Gestapo, to excuse them for army service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I told to my boss, how can I do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Iam a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">They are not permitted to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Why do you send me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">He said, I give you order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">You have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Having no choice, I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">The Gestapo at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> greeted me with a heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I was careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I answered, . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Poles were not supposed to say heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I explained to him the reason of my coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I produced the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">He took care of it, positively, and when I was supposed to leave, again I said . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And he said heil Hitler and he called me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And he said, why don't you say heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Aren't you good enough to say heil Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I said, I I said in German, I am not supposed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">What do you mean you're not supposed to? </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I said Iam a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">He got so angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">He took the telephone and called up my boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">How did you dare to send a Pole on such a sensitive mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Another incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">There's another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Railroad authority had a big ball, and they wanted...the one of the chief ones whose wife was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , asked my boss if I will be his company...companion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I tried to get out of it, because it was very dangerous and I was not supposed to socialize with Germans, and if I would be caught, it's terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">As a Pole and on top of as a Jewess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">So I said to my boss I will only go if you will tell him the truth, that Iam not ethnic German but I am a Pole, and if he wants to take the risks, because as well as for the Germans, if they are caught they were sent to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> .

id="1197">Not only that she is not German, because they thought I'm German...not only she's not Polish, she's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">So my husband was sure that knowing him as a womanizer that probably I promised something all done and now he tries to protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">So he moved closer to me, my husband, and he told me, do you know any other language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">What other language do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I said uh English, German, Russian, and I still didn't say Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Any other language? </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">So he start asking me in English, what little

believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">He said how come this young girl can speak so well the Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Was probably the Germans who taught her Hebrew...she should spy on the Jews and get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">So then he asked me when do we say . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">When he asked me about 1 understood he's Jewish too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Excited with tears in my eyes, I said to him, you too? </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">So naturally then he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">He switched back to Polish and from then he stated the purpose of his coming...that he came, they found out this is the company that build the <span class="DLF">barricades</span> and built the <span class="DLF">columns</span> and he wants the plans because he knows I was the secretary and I must have it...the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">I should give him to save the <span

your <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">The father survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Barchowski survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">He came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">We met him after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">The sister survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">I had little trouble with the sister, because she like to drink a little bit, and it was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">I really...the last two months maybe also persuaded me to leave, and the little girl survived, who's now married, lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , has family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">So we really tried to help each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Now after I met my husband, he was very busy at that time uh because they're managing to take care of many Germans who were...and naturally he supplied me with food, with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">But what only...what he supplied not only me...he gave me clothes because this was the time in May when the Jews, slave laborers came out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">Tattered stripe...what they had there, the or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">He gave me clothes that he took from the Germans, that he conf...confiscated from the <span class="INT_SPACE">German apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">I should give it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Then there were many orphans that Jews started collecting them, you know, who survived, looked, some knew where they have hidden their children, and one Jewess, although she converted, , she took care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">But she didn't have food to feed them, not to dress them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And it came to my husband's attention and he was able to supply them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">What we didn't know...at that time my husband was a high official in the Polish government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ...so this , brought the children to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and she put his name, under the name that he was known at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">It's a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">So then he got a death sentence because he also searched for the , the ones that wanted to poison him, that were so anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">So I arr...1 was able to arrange for him a transfer to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">But meantime I wanted to study medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">I didn't have any papers, so I have to take exam that dismiss me from the whole subjects and he had connections and I was accepted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> but he was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , so I dropped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">I went with him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and I saw that this is under a satellite of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I didn't survive the war to be cut off again from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Even my husband with high position, I felt I'm a queen for one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">This is not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">So I told my husband I don't want to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">We survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">We have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and my husband wanted to fight, at that time to join the Jewish , to be able to fight for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">He couldn't obtain a legal permission to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">He was told the only way he can leave or he'll be sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> or he should shoot himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">The confidential (ph), the high position he had, he knows too many secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">So I arranged for him...it's a long story...an escape and he escaped and then I escaped with his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">I wanted with him, but his brother who survived with him decided that I have to stay with him, he should be able to liquidate the business which was not my <span class="NPIP">place</span> with the brother, only with my husband, but he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">This was an older brother sixteen years, so he listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">They kept us as hostages waiting for my husband to return to look for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Luckily one Jew who know not my husband and me, learned about it, so he guaranteed for me because they just kept me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">I was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , but there was no sentence for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">They just wanted him come
