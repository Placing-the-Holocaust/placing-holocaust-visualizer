<p><span class="sentence" id="930">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">ANSWER:  But it's really -- where we lived was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , that's what I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And the guards, when we wanted to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , we had to excuse ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And if the guards said, no, you can't go right now, we couldn't go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  So we had to --

<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  So it was a starvation diet. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">It really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And I don't know how much longer, you know, we could have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Because we were all losing our strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Because if you don't get enough nourishment and all you do is work.... Unfortunately I was in my growing stages and that's why I have so many hang ups right now, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Maybe I would have had those anyway but I'm blaming everything on these years whatever I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Did you make any friends in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">QUESTION:  Was there ever a time there that you got sick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">ANSWER:  You didn't want to get sick because if you got sick and you couldn't work, they had every months transported, transports that picked you up and you were gone and never heard of again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">So you really didn't want to get sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">QUESTION:  So somehow you managed to get up and go to work every day”
