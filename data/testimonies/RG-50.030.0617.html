<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I think the Pacific was more in the minds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I think it was Being (?</span><span class="sentence" id="392">marry?) </span><span class="sentence" id="393">and all in that <span class="NPIP">part</span> , but then sometimes they would ship you from <span class="REGION">California</span> to go the other way, from the other direction to go that way, that was hard to figure out sometimes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  That was probably after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wasserburg</span> and we loaded up, and 20 of us, I think, were on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Or two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I think there were five in each <span class="NPIP">side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  Do you know what you were supposed to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  You were just told to --
ANSWER:  They didn't tell us anything, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And here -- I think back on it now, here I am going in this peaceful countryside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and suddenly I'm going to be dropped off at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the most inhumane things happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Tell us what you saw when you went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">You're in these two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , about 20 guys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Okay, we pull in there, at first I don't see -- it looks like a peaceful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Here we are on the ground area and I get out -- we get out to stretch our legs, but the minute I turn, I'm facing that way and I see this boy, eight to ten years old, and he's talking to a soldier, and he has something in his hand, and I go -- naturally I wanted to see what's going on there, and so I go over there and I see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> immediately with the <span class="DLF">door</span> open.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  So you're <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  Yes, and this was up by the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were finally housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And he's showing these pictures, and he had them all -- in all stages of being gassed and piled bodies and being brought to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  So they were photographs of people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Actual photographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  I wonder where he got them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  And where he got those -- I wish he had -- and that boy disappeared that very day, I don't know -- when we were called to go check in for our baggage and our <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , he was gone and never found him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  Do you remember what he looked like, how he was dressed? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">What --
ANSWER:  He yjust had on regular pants and a shirt and he was about -- and that soldier bought these from him, the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I wonder where he got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I think about it so many times, where did he get those pictures, but they were --
QUESTION:  Did he look like he was a local boy from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who had come there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  That's what I'm -- I'm thinking he was either from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or he was from that thing that I called the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Now, I'm not sure if that was the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> back there, because on the map that I was sent, it showed the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in a more <span class="REGION">area</span> where there were all <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> around it, but that wasn't the case where I landed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  Well, tell me --
ANSWER:  Oh, by the way, that <span class="DLF">furnace door</span> was open and I could see hair all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It was just filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Big clumps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Did you -- so this was the first time you see what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and what did you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  Oh... had read about it and heard, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I said, well, here, look, I'm looking at where it actually happened here, you know, here it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I could see ashes in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  Do you remember the hair color?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Do you remember the color of the hair?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  Gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Lots of gray hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And some were kind of black, you know, but they were big, and the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And then I turned around the other way and there was the <span class="BUILDING">water tower</span> , and it wasn't a typical <span class="BUILDING">water tower</span> where you would get drinking water from. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I'm sure it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I'm sure it was a collecting tower for water where they could perform those experiments that I read about, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  Well, tell me what you had read, because I was trying to get a sense of how much you knew what you were going to see, and it seems that you didn't know that there were some things that were going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION:  So when was the first time you heard of what might have been going on there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  That was months before I read in the paper and people talked about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  In the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We got -- well, we just heard about it over there even. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We knew that it was going on, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And that <span class="BUILDING">water tower</span> , it had no top on it, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">That made me think, oh, this is where they performed those -- you know what they did, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  Well, I want you to tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  I would like for you to tell me what —
ANSWER:  Iread where they actually took them, the bodies, and put them in there alive to test how long they could survive in the cold water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  And how high was that <span class="BUILDING">water tower</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  It wasn't -- well, it was probably -- the <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> were probably about 8 feet and then it was maybe 10 feet tall, I would guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  So it wasn't one of those water towers that's way up high?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It was one where there's plenty of water in there that would freeze and collect water from the rain and everything else, and I'm just sure that -- and I could visualize this <span class="REGION">area</span> was perfect for this set up, because when I went to the big -- then the other <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was there, the huge <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , I wish I knew the whole history of that thing there, but when I first went there, there's this <span class="DLF">entryway</span> , and the first thing I see is these shelves filled with the jars, you know, with all the human parts of the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And I said --
QUESTION:  Were they labeled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  What? </span><span class="sentence" id="712">No, but I could tell what they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  You could tell what they were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  You want me to name them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Hands, complete hand, fingers, ears, eyes, breast, a penis, liver, kidneys, intestines -- everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It sticks. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">You're not going to forget that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  Ofcourse not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  Isaw that and then I knew -- I says right away, well, this would be the spot maybe where -- this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we're going to be staying, maybe there were doctors in there, you know, with a few SS troops because they had the angora hutches there, two <span class="BUILDING">hutches</span> with rabbits. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And I also read that they used that fur for the colors for their uniforms in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I don't know who fed those rabbits. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I never saw anyone feed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  And there were still live rabbits there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  Yes, there were rabbits in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And then the big -- that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was so huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I think it was longer than a <span class="DLF">football field</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  Which <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  As you went through the <span class="DLF">entryway</span> into a big <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">There was a big <span class="DLF">opening door</span> and you go in there and that's where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were with all of these instruments that were manufactured, and I believe —
QUESTION:  What kind of -- I'm sorry, did I interrupt you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  I think the Holocaust victims might have made those. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But I saw no machinery in there at the time because we didn't get to stay there long enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We only saw the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , but I'll bet there were a hundred <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  But tell me what kind of instruments are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  Oh, there was compasses, pliers. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  That's okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  Pliers, compasses, wrenches, all kinds of drafting material. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Beautiful, beautiful things they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And I wish I could have gone in -- and you know what happened the next day? </span><span class="sentence" id="741">We never went in there again, so I think the thing was locked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  Well, tell me -- let's step back a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you were in before -- Wasser something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wasserburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wasserburg</span> , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So when you're going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wasserburg</span> and you're on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and you're being told you're going to go someplace but you're not being told where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  Not really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  Uh-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  Okay, and you're not told why, either --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  -- what you're going to be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  And so your first impression is when you see this little boy and he's showing these photographs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  And when he shows the photographs, by that point do you know that you're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau Concentration Camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  Oh, definitely, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">We knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">QUESTION:  And that's inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> must have gone into some kind of <span class="DLF">fenced enclosure</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It was -- well, it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Then did I tell you about the women in that stockade that I mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  I would like -- let's bring that -- we'll get to that, but I would like to get a sense of what you saw when you got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you're on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and then all of a sudden you're somewhere else, and what was it that -- you know what did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Well, first the boy, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  Were there <span class="DLF">walls</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  Oh, there, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We were fenced in. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">We got the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there and then there are <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">All around us there's <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , so you don't see much other than the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that I mentioned and the <span class="BUILDING">water tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We're hemmed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> was right behind our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  So, in other words, you've driven into an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="775">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> have gone into an enclosed <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  More or less with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , if you count the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">There was no <span class="DLF">fences</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  There were no <span class="DLF">fences</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  I wishI could spot it on that map, but I just can't find the location.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  That's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">That's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And you get off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and you see that there 1s this kid talking to one of the soldiers and the soldier buys the photos from him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  And then when you look around, you see -- what else do you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I start tying everything together, and then that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the <span class="BUILDING">annex</span> to it with the shelves and all of the —
QUESTION:  There's no sign that says <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau Concentration Camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  By that point does somebody come to you and say why you're there? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Do you figure out why you're supposed to be there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  Noteven yet, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It took a few days and then finally one morning the lieutenant said we're going to dig out here. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">He put me in charge and we started digging some <span class="DLF">holes</span> for the posts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">QUESTION:  For posts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">ANSWER:  Posts for a little stockade, I guess, we were going to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">For whom I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They didn't tell us that, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  So you're digging and there are 20 of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">ANSWER:  Right, about 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  And you're the one who is responsible for them to make sure that they dig properly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  Right, I was supposed to make sure that they did the digging. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I did some of the digging and the lieutenant said, "You don't have to do that, you're in charge of this," but I kept digging anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I like to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">But then about two or three days later is when I saw that stockade in the other direction, and then all of a sudden all of these women appear looking through the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , but you can't see many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> because of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">But then on this side you could see a little part of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there, so maybe they were in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> the day before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">QUESTION:  Do you know who they were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">QUESTION:  Were they prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">ANSWER:  They were prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">They were all dressed in these brown skirts and brown blouses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  Did they look well fed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  Not real well, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">They looked a little haggard, but they had been fed, I'm sure, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">They weren't -- nothing like the Holocaust victims, I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I bet they were political prisoners or something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  So they still had been prisoners of the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  It wasn't Germans who became prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Evidently they were from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> because they looked a little different, not all alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  Isee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">ANSWER:  I wish I knew who they were, but then we lost track of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">They were gone again after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Maybe they left at night or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was weird in a way that there were ghosts there. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">There was no traffic in or out after we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I can't remember a single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or anything coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And the people at that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , that I call a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , about a hundred yards down the <span class="DLF">line</span> from our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , all I saw there -- we weren't supposed to go there either -- were nurses evidently because they had the white uniforms on, and I felt, well, maybe they're nursing some of these Holocaust victims who couldn't move or be transferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  Did you see -- but you saw -- you saw -- you saw former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  Where did you see those, those people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">They were down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Sometimes you would see one come out, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I'm sure they were because we couldn't tell from a distance, but I assumed they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">QUESTION:  I guess part of me is a little confused because I always pictured that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> had to be enclosed because otherwise people would escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  But that's not what you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  Not our <span class="REGION">area</span> , no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">ANSWER:  Unless the Army removed it, you know, but I doubt that. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">But they had removed all of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and things, I'm sure, from all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We didn't see any of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  What date was it that you entered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  This was a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I think we came there in June and then we stayed into July. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So it was over a month after they had been cleared. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">But that's what I figured was going on down there at that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , that they were treating survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  They were treating survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  Yeah, and that would fit in perfectly there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">QUESTION:  Now, had you -- but you didn't meet any survivors? </span><span class="sentence" id="854">You didn't --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">No.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  How did you feel that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">QUESTION:  In what way did you feel like it was ghosts?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I found those and there were about four of them, pliers and compass and a few other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">QUESTION:  Excuse me that I'm interrupting, but where did you find them? </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Tell us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  They were out on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">They were sort of laying in a rag thing in plastic, and I picked them up, and I don't know why I didn't -- when I was a kid, I always buried things. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I do it now with our kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">We buried the box in our <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">We still haven't dug it up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So I think that's why I did it, was to sort of put this whole thing to rest, as if I'm burying what happened here. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I think I did that maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And if I could be there, I possibly could find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I don't know, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were awful large then already, and I didn't bury very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">About that deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">QUESTION:  Where do you remember having buried them? </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Was it under a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  Yes, it was by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">About that far away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was a little hard, but I got them covered up about that high maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  By "that high," you're talking about how many? </span><span class="sentence" id="946">About a foot, about 8 inches?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  Yeah, about 8 inches probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  About 8 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  And I leveled it off sort of nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I don't think any of the other guys knew that I buried them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  Did other guys find things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">One man -- I don't think they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">No, I don't think they did, because none of them ever told me anything about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  Did you guys talk amongst one another about what you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">ANSWER:  Not much of that either, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Well, I mean, this one man, when I went up there, we talked about -- we were shaking our heads and we were getting nervous and we couldn't believe this boy, that young boy there, but that was terrible, but then we were told not to go -- oh, yeah, not to go over to those ladies over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">One guy wanted to go over there and go and talk to them, oh, no, no, you better not, you'll get in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I don't know why we couldn't go to that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> down there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">QUESTION:  So you were just told to stay away from things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  Uh-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">QUESTION:  And the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where you went where you found the jars with all the human parts, did you go there again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  I would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I would have loved to go way in deep there, but it was closed evidently because we never went in there again, and I know I would have gone in, and I don't remember -- because I know we couldn't go in there again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  Who would have closed it? </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Your lieutenant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  Probably the lieutenant maybe got orders or someone from the other area there at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> maybe was in charge or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I wonder where all of those tools ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">That just bothers me something terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">What happened to that? </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Why -- and who was feeding the rabbits? </span><span class="sentence" id="975">It was just a puzzle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">QUESTION:  And you never saw any corpses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION:  By that time in June there were no more corpses or --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Everything was -- but that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> showed me enough, though, about what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And why there was only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> , that would be perfect, though, for experimentation, wouldn't it? </span><span class="sentence" id="981">They only needed one because they would take an individual -- they even inoculated some of them with bad diseases and then they disposed of the bodies, I would imagine, right there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">QUESTION:  When you had read this stuff back still in the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> that there were things like this going on, do you remember how you reacted? </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Was it kind of like disbelief or was it —
ANSWER:  I think it was more disbelief than anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Who could do that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I mean, you start hearing about enough of it, you know, and you say, well, how can our people be doing that? </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Here we have the ancestry sort of and, you know, how can...
QUESTION:  You asked yourselves these kinds of questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">QUESTION:  Did you ask yourselves those kind of questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">ANSWER:  Sort of, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And then, you know, the people they say there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Daubner</span> , they said they didn't know this was going on, but that's impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">They had to know this was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">The smoke was in the...
QUESTION:  Did it smell funny when you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">That seemed to be quite gone, but I'm just sure -- I read about that also, how the smoke was drifting terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I'm sure it's in all those <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">But I can say that there was no <span class="DLF">fence</span> around us but these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> hemmed us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">We were hemmed in and we just never- and why we were given a pass to get out of there, I don't think that anybody ever left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> other than the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> there a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Where would you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  Where would I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I don't want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">There might be a sniper there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">QUESTION:  I turned it off because I sneezed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">You're saying it was weird, huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">ANSWER:  That really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">We didn't really go -- want to go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I don't know where you would go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">QUESTION:  Itis strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">So you're there, you're isolated, and you're there for how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">ANSWER:  I would guess it's probably three weeks at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  And your job was to build a stockade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And then all of a sudden after we just leave it unfinished, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I remember that: It wasn't finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  Well, what did it look like? </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">How much had you built?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">ANSWER:  We Just had some posts in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And the <span class="DLF">holes</span> took a long time to dig, you know, because it was all by hand and shovel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">We didn't have the equipment, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">That's all we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I think we had about three or four of those <span class="DLF">holes</span> dug, and, oh, we're going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">QUESTION:  And that was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">ANSWER:  That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">On that map, though, it has to be one of the corners up in that map there, I think 1s where it is, where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> goes along, and that has to be the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">QUESTION:  Tell me how did that -- did it change? </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Did you feel like it changed you when you saw this stuff?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1029">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I mean, I can't imagine people doing -- it's just -- I mean, you pray to the Lord about it, you know, how could this happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1031">QUESTION:  And did you while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I pray today that it never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Humanity to man, it's something -- even though I was young, I mean, you had that -- it's even more now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Now you realize, you know, what it was really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">It builds on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">It builds up the older you get.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">QUESTION:  Do you think having seen something firsthand it brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to you in a way that if you'd only read about it, 1t would have been different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">ANSWER:  I think so, oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">When I saw that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> , you know, and that <span class="DLF">door</span> open with that hair, and that boy, those pictures, then you knew what you knew, that that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I mean, that was -- I think that's why during that -- the more I think about it now, I'm glad I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">I sort of buried the inhumane things I did there in that <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">That's the feeling that I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">QUESTION:  Those instruments that you buried, you said there were four pieces?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">ANSWER:  About four. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Four or five.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">QUESTION:  Do you remember what they were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1048">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Well, I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">One was a compass sort of --
QUESTION:  Oh, that's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1051">ANSWER:  -- a protractor and a wrench, I think, and pliers maybe and...
QUESTION:  And do you think those were things that prisoners might have made or --
ANSWER:  Ireally do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I mean, I think they were made by -- I'm sure they would unless this was a staging area where they brought all the tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">But why would they bring them there and then ship them out or -- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">It just doesn't seem right, but 1t was a huge <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> so it could be used for something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1056">QUESTION:  So instead of the first day when you saw the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and it had all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and tools on it and items and things like that, it was similar to what you saw in that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , those four things that you buried?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, oh, yes, plus a lot of others probably if I could have gone in there and looked at the other hundred <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Oh, there was -- you could see all the shiny -- you know, every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was filled, just filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And that was -- it was as long as a <span class="DLF">football field</span> I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">QUESTION:  Did you meet anybody Jewish while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  Let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I think in that one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , maybe, one little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we were up in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there 1s a boy -- a couple of boys that always came down, I think they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">They always came down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">QUESTION:  What time was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1065">ANSWER:  Oh, gosh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Furstenfeldbruck</span> maybe or one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">He'd come up to -- this one man had met them before we got there, and the boys would come up there and I would ask them about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and things, and he spoke a little English, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">They talked in English, I guess, a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">That's the only time, though, that I think that I really came in contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">QUESTION:  So when you guys were taken out from there, you still didn't talk about it much with one another, those —
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I'll bet we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I just can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I'm just sure we did, or unless we tried to put it all out of our minds, but I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I think we talked about it, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I'm sure we did, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">QUESTION:  Where did you go from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">ANSWER:  Then I ended up in another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> , I think it was, where we had just <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">There was no real <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">It was just in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , because I remember spending a lot of days just sitting on a log in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and I remember thinking, well, where am I going to be 50 years from now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>

QUESTION:  In general, in what way do you think your Army experience -- did it change you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Did it shape you in some way?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1327">ANSWER:  More about the world, right, what people are like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Read, write. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">I often say, well, it was kind of tough at times, but I wouldn't want to give it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">It was a valuable thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">It really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">Learning to live under certain conditions and the way you had to eat sometimes and training was even dangerous at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">When it rained and poured in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , then our <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> blew over, our pop<span class="BUILDING">-up tent</span> blew away, and we didn't know what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">We got soaked, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Wake up in the morning and they served you some oatmeal and it's raining and, I'll tell you, it was -- and then you had to crawl under the <span class="DLF">wire fence</span> during the machine gun shooting over you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1336">QUESTION:  Is this during training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">ANSWER:  Yes, during training. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">The only mission -- well, they were pretty close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">They tried to make it realistic and you had to keep low, keep your head down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Well, I really hope I answered a lot of your things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">QUESTION:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I appreciate —
ANSWER:  There's a lot of things that I wish I just knew more about, you know, like what happened to that boy —
QUESTION:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">ANSWER:  -- where he came from, and those tools, what happened to all that and who made them, and why didn't we finish that what we started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1345">QUESTION:  A lot of unanswered questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1346">ANSWER:  Right, and what happened to those women over there in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , why didn't we see them stockade -- or when did they come, why didn't we know more about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">QUESTION:  I think those are terrific questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">I mean, it's sort of like you see something and it stays a mystery until you have an answer for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1350">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1351">QUESTION:  And here you were in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for about six or seven weeks and there was no one who answered all of these mysterious —
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">But I've put it all together myself now and I'm so sure that's what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">It was a perfect setup for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">QUESTION:  For the medical experiments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1355">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">When I looked at those jars, you don't have parts like that on display if you're just a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">I wonder why they left them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">I was surprised at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1359">QUESTION:  Were there like hundreds of jars?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1360">ANSWER:  Oh, there were at least 20 or more, 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I would say at least three shelves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">I can just see them as if I'm looking at them right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And you wouldn't have that on display unless it was something unusual, like, why did they leave them there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">Maybe that's why they locked the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">Maybe somebody came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">I wonder if this <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was if it even is a visitor's place now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">I wonder if it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">QUESTION:  Have you ever been back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1370">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">QUESTION:  You've never been back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1372">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Never went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">That would be sort of interesting, but my age and my health isn't quite up to that anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I would start digging if I was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1376">QUESTION:  Maybe you would recognize where you were in relationship to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1377">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I think if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> was still there, I can spot the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">I know just about where I went from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1380">QUESTION:  It sounds like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was one of those moments that stays in your memory like where you were when Pearl Harbor was attacked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1381">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">Well, it did, because I told you I don't remember what I ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I can't picture a single meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I don't know when I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , how I slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">It's all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And most of the days are just a blank, but that first day and that other day when I saw that other thing, the <span class="DLF">wire enclosure</span> , those things stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And then the girls at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , you know, because the first ttme I saw any humans other than us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">But I think there were only about 20 of us, that was It.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1389">QUESTION:  Have you kept in touch with any of those others who were with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1390">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">We never got addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">We should have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">A lot of groups get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">They do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">They're probably all gone now, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">If they were a year older, they might have -- I shouldn't laugh about that -- I didn't laugh, but there aren't many of them around anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I don't think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1398">QUESTION:  Well, I appreciate that you have shared your thoughts and your memories with us today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">Is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1400">ANSWER:  Well, I think I've covered it pretty well, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">I just wish we could have talked with more people though, you know —
QUESTION:  Ican imagine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1402">ANSWER:  -- the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Never got to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">The ones that survived were gone from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">They were gone, taken care of evidently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And I didn't know about that march, either, that they had from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> where they took -- we never heard about that, anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">QUESTION:  It sounds like there was -- that there was very little information that you got while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1409">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">The officers didn't tell us much about anything like that, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Nope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">They should have maybe, shouldn't they? </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">But my guess -- yeah, but someday if I ever find out where I was, I'll have to write you and tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">I've got the maps at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> yet, so I'll try to spot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I'll try to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1416">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">In that case, I will say thank you for your time, for your memories, and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Martin Gaudian on February 16th, 2011.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1419">ANSWER:  Thank you for listening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">End of File Two Conclusion of Interview </span>
