<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, we were an average family in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> before the war and...uh...my father, mother and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I had a brother who was 7 years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And my father was in the ...lumber business and lived there with his father, grandfather that I know oflived in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Before that I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">What was your childhood like growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Well, it was a pretty happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I went to eider when I was about 6 years old, then at 7 I went to Hebrew gymnasium which is a high schoot until about...until I was about 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And then in 1940...
QUESTION:  Hold it one second. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Before we get to 1940, tell me a little bit about...uh...the friends you had, the things you did during the day as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Well, it was...1t was an average life. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had a...we lived in a nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panemon</span> was a small community. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It consisted of one long <span class="DLF">street</span> with a few <span class="DLF">alleys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And it was the <span class="DLF">gateway</span> to which were...were summer homet3 B for the people who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They used to come over to spend their weekends in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> where they had built <span class="BUILDING">summer homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Also was real close by and it was beautiful <span class="DLF">beach</span> and we used to spend our weekends there and it was real nice before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And then in 1940, when the Russians took over Lithuanta..*uh...we didn't have any more <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> and we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish schools</span> and that's when we started g ~ learning Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I think Hebrew was outlawed or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I studied there for 1 year in a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And...well...uh...we could talk a little bit...uh...about that one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Well, uh my father had to leave his business because uh you couldn't be a businessman under the â€”_ Russian regime, and he tried to get a job several times and had difficulties because he didn't belong to any party, and he was not involved in politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And being...having been in business before the war, it was a little difficult to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So we kind of struggled through that year, but it wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We made tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> broke loose, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was on a Sunday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for my...for the uniforms of my basketball team. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I was about 14years and I was...at 4:00 in the morning when I was extremely tired I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And at 6:00 in the morning, I was woken and told that the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and they're going to be in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> any day, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So we had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our belongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my brother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And we just started toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a day or so to get to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I believe that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was where my father was born and I think it was named...I'm not really very sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And that is when the Germans met us and the <span class="DLF">border</span> was closed, and there was no need to go any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So we walked into the first abandoned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we found, probably was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> , other people who ran away, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And in the meantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , vicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they asked...uh...what time it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar Mitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They said, "Well, give me that watch immediately." </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my brother kind of resisted, so when the Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed my brother's watch and just handed it over real fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And this was our first introduction to the German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang around. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There was no use to stay in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We still had our horse, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and some of our belongings and we headed back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panemon</span> , through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">On the <span class="DLF">road</span> , they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped all of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And they just kept us there for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We...we spent a few nights there I believe <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It wasn't cold...cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And no...no one knew what the future's going to bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But after that I remembert...I believe that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Exactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Tell us about the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh port</span> was, I believe, an <span class="BUILDING">army base</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It may have been some kind of a military defense area or something like that, but 1t was pretty green...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Uh...I remember that my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my father on my one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and my mother and I...they took us in another area of the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was 11 years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of days...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I... remember that right before they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> was a similar place as the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , they had given them an order to some of the younger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the <span class="REGION">women's side</span> , and I...someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or 16 could go to the <span class="REGION">women's side</span> and my brother tried to go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I don't know, he probably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do 60.And...uh...they didn't let him through because they said he looked older. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Actually, he was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And he looked older, and they didn't let him in...let him go to...to...uh...his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">All the men were shot, but my father was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">This is another long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">My father was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I believe when <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in 1916 or something like that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And while <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in certain prominent Close Lithuanian life. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They were ...and they were honored many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">My father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Uh...So before they told all the youngsters or after to go to another <span class="NPIP">side</span> , to the <span class="REGION">women's side</span> , they also announced that everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Every man who was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh., </span><span class="sentence" id="84">soldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And indeed, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They took them to a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was called the...the <span class="BUILDING">Yellow Prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They called it the <span class="BUILDING">Yellow Prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I know that my father was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So at that time my father was not shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It was only my brother and my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Then the...and....uh...my father was...uh...in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And later on when we were released from the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> , after being there...uh...and...uh...my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go to see his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He said, "Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back." </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my father came to visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We knew about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We heard all kinds of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Who knows why? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But, we really don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were and respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of these...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They...when the orders came, they told the Jews have to leave their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> ...their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Well, not all the belongings, but...uh...that you couldn't take with you and move to that designated <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> which was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And my mother and I...we just took the things that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Couldn't...tried to exchange our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with some Lithuanians, but I guess we just were not successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Some people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Some people gave up big <span class="BUILDING">mansions</span> for little <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and...uh...they moved in there, but there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for everyone so they...people who had those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> took in their families, their friends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I and my mother, we shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a neighbor of ours who...uh...was...we were close before the war and...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband, and her daughter, who was my brother's age and I think they were friends...uh...had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they acquired somehow from some relatives or friends in one of those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and they took us in and we...shared one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the four of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Can you...can you go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You had told me before that while your father was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> your mother had taken his papers and tried to do something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Well...well, my mother always cherished papers, a being the, that volunteers...and his medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And that was...we tell that was a precious thing because most of the...most of our encounter all the misfortunes that we had until then were always caused by Lithuanian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we didn't see that many Germans around at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I'm sure they gave all the orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But I we didn't see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So we felt...she felt especially that those papers and medals may come in handy someday. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">She always kept them on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh...Well...there's so much to talk about...
QUESTION:  You had gone ahead and you are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Yes, I'm in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But...uh...there was another incident that if I may I should back up a little but that's always stuck with me too is when...when the Russians came in, although we were not in great shape financially either, but my father since he was a volunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some...for the Lithuanian Army...for the Lithuanian army before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And he was friendly with some...uh...people in high command. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And he find out where we lived there a general who was I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian army and when the Russians came in they sent him to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And...and he had left his wife and children in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and my father knew them. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I remember that whenever he could, he used to take some packages over there or even lumber to heat the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> most of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were heated by lumber, good lumber. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And he...he was quite friendly with them and tried to help that particular year. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And right after the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> right before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were sitting in this <span class="BUILDING">lady's house</span> , Mrs. Mudrick was her name, and...uh...just talking about the future in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and things like that, where we're going to move <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> or whatever and I.... looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It, it was about two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> away from ours in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panemon</span> , and I looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and here was the General walking with his wife and was going back to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the...on the... They lived...they had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panemon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I kind of felt a great feeling because I felt this is one man who probably could help release my father from that <span class="BUILDING">Yellow prison</span> that he was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I pointed her out to my mother, "Look who's walking by here. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Why don't you go out and talk to him really quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I'm sure he knows us. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Especially...she knows us, and maybe they can do something," my mother went out real quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was with her and I remember that for a minute they acted like...like...they didn't even know us or pretended anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And...uh...she told them who we were and they nodded and she begged them to see if theyâ€™Il...can do something about releasing my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But needless to t say, nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That is one incident that stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Uh...Alright, I guess now the next thing is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Tell us again which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you were in and how did you get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Well, from what I remember it was quite simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We just walked or...or took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I really don't remember exactly how we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Maybe on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">No, I cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I know that we were there in 1941, and I was11 years old with my mother and she had arranged to live in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with Mrs. Widrick and her daughter, Rita.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  You are not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  Tell us about that ride.</span><span class="sentence" id="404">Ot
ANSWER:  Well, the ride to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We were...we were put in three â€” <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad wagons</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train wagons</span> , 131 ofusand D we we were stopping someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">The only thing I really remember from that ride is that we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> where some Russian prisoners were able to walkup to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there were some <span class="DLF">port holes</span> in our cattleOg # 513 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and warned US to see and try to...try to escape if we could because...uh...they said if you are Jewish and youare.. going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , that's where they kill them Oq Â» D all. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So if you have a chance, just run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And some of us couldn't . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And it...it took quite a while to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And one incident I remember was that since we>q # O were all Lithuanian children that none of us spoke Polish so _â€”_28 to try to escape was useless or we wouldn't know to talk or how to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Butin my...1n my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , there were two boys who did speak Polish, a little or a lot I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I knew they knew something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And they told us that a they were going to jump and escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Now, we hada big _â€”_ dilemma because if they escaped and we knew from the ghetto Ib Qdif one did anything wrong, all of us would be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So we had a plan made up with them thst they...we would try __ to...there were two older German guards in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ,and we would try to distract them to try...there were maybe 60 qOofus or 50 of US on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we would try...there = was only...the was only made of about we were maybe about 5 or 10 kids involved in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And...uh...we said like this, that they're going to go through that <span class="DLF">port hole</span> , â€”_tnD try to climb down the step of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and stay there for awhile until maybe the moment that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slows down a little bit...I believe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going about maybe 40 miles an hour, 50 miles an hour, and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slow down and maybe in a brushy area where it would be softer...softer to land, they would try to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And to protect us because out of 50 kids someone had to see that they were jumping out and not to tell the Germans that would have been the end of every one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So we decided with them that they're going to jump and in about a couple of hours later, we would pretend...we would be about...and...100 miles away...120 miles away from that <span class="REGION">area</span> ...a couple of hours later, we would pretend that we just saw the kids jump, and we would tell the German guards that here two kids have jumped out and here they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They're laying right here watching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And...uh...maybe that would save us and...uh...1n the meantime, Seli thit w%l;;D-, they wouldn't...they wouldn't even look for them that far away and...uh...maybe they would. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So we did itZ; q D that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We...we took four...four of us, starting talking to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They were kind of older and they were not from the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">They were from the Wehrmacht, so...so you could speak to them once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">They would...I remember someone was talking to them about knives, about other/3 61) things. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I don't remember the conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">About we were watching the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> or the greenery while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going by. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We just talked to them and kept them busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And all of a sudden, like we said, about two hours later, one kid ran up to us and started to pretend that he's telling me a? </span><span class="sentence" id="430">bao secret~ And they got excited and they asked whatts happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We said, "Go look quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Through that <span class="DLF">window</span> , the <span class="DLF">port hole</span> , two kids just jumped out." </span><span class="sentence" id="434">First, they didn't believe it and then they kinda looked and then3 AO they said, "Well, it took you too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They were right there." </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And thirdly, they started to call the officer somehow and made some signs that we should stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> reco+Mblc and to recount them because if they took them to , we/ # 61D were missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Now that took a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And they30stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They took us all out and they counted us three times, and two were missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">SO they...they asked us, Where did it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And they said, "About five minutes# dD ago, they all jumped out, and we reported it, we saw it.</span><span class="sentence" id="442">"And okay, from what I understand they did call the localpolice in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but that may have had been 10towns...those kids were about 10 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> behind us...andthey...they were looking for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We don'tknow. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But from what I heard lately, I think one...ne of/4 4O them did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Someone told me a story that one kid whenthey were transported from...uh...from...uh...we were goingto <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> jumped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">One of theLithuanian kids jumped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and he's somewhere iny 5 ; > <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And I'm trying to see if we can makecontact and meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And...uh...that I learned recently ayear...maybe a few months ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So we then we came <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">toAuschwitz,- Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We were led in. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We were kept for3 about 3 days in

id="454">And we could see a lot of concerned inmates, old timers whoused to come in and out, in and out, talk to us, and ask usZ S qt questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And we found out...out later, the reason westayed there about four days before letting us into thecamps is because this is the first transport of children whowere let into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">There were some childrenyC CnD before who came with their father or families. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">WhenI say 31 children, 13, 14, 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And we were the first...1t was late in the war andthings had started to change a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So what happened, we don't really know.</span><span class="sentence" id="460">But they told us U aO later that...uh...they were very surprised and happy that wewere the first

</span><span class="sentence" id="469">There was notn 4 D too much work for us, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But there was one brigade that used to...that usedto come out of this
