ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">May 11, 1999
QUESTION:  — how that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Yeah, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">In — as I spoke previously, from the other tape you probably heard that on the last part of our journey, so to speak, we found ourselves in — closed up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">They were shipping us, to where we don’t exactly know, but supposedly, from what we’ve heard after the war, that our journey was taking us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  And you had been where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsnig</span> by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torgau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  It was our last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> —
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  — that we were in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And we is who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  The group, you know, the whole — you know, we were like about 3,000 women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  So the group, when I speak we, I refer to the — to the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  They put us on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> and we were traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , all of a sudden we had to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And why did we have to stop? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the May 11, 1999 <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">This was already 1945, you see, most of the time, to tell you the truth, didn’t know exactly when, what time it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But later we found out that the war was getting — was almost of the brink of being finished, except we didn’t realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But when we stopped at our — in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were bombed, we couldn’t go — excuse me — much farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So what had happened, while we were waiting there for repairs, the SS had this speech to us, he said hey, you ought to be very happy, because this is April 20", 1945, it’s Hitler’s birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And we, we were thinking why in the hell should we be happy that it’s Hitler’s birthday? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But of course he said we will give you an extra piece of bread to celebrate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And no sooner did he finish as the whole <span class="DLF">sky</span> became black and we were actually bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were hit by the allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Not direct, but next to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And actually, we were like about 3,000 women, probab — [coughs] excuse me — probab —
QUESTION:  You want a cough drop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  No, I—I am using a —
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Probably a thousand of us got killed by the bombs, and the rest of us, when this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> split open, and we saw like an <span class="DLF">opening</span> , the ones who were able to, we just ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We hid out. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We couldn’t stay there too long, because after all, they didn’t give us that extra piece of bread, so we couldn’t do a — hide out too much, May 11, 1999 and we finally came out and we spotted this Russian — he was like a — probably like a colonel in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And we ran over to him and he said, don’t worry, you are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And that’s how we actually were liberated, which was already like not exactly April 20", because it took us like two days longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But apparently, the Russians were already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I always say, had the Germans left us in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we probably would have been liberated by the Americans, because I think where we were liberated was almost very near where the Americans and the Russians met, near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe river</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Excuse me, that makes a sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Oh yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So anyhow, that was mine liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So what do you do after you were liberated? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">You know, we had thru — in a way, we had a chance, because we could have — and the Russians were encouraging us to go on a rampage, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The Germans killed us, you go out, you have a chance now, kill the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We decided this wasn’t our way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Wh-When they were telling you to do this, how did they —
ANSWER:  The Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Yeah, did you have weapons to — May 11, 1999
ANSWER:  No, we didn’t have weapons, but we could have gotten — they would have been delighted to give us a — one of their guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  The Russians would have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Yeah, they would have, but —
QUESTION:  So they would have helped you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But we decided ourselves that’s no way to go, and we just figured because we didn’t like what they were doing to us, we would turn around doing the same thing to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">After all, the German that I would have picked up, I probably would have never — had never seen him before. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It would have been just picking up a German because he was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And it — this wasn’t our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And the next thing what we started doing 1s let’s go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Let’s try to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  N-Now when you say we, were — who — where — did you have special friends that you were with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  We kind of got — when we were liberated, because we were so used to always being in groups, like I didn't know how to be by myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  I-It — so like about 15 girls, we got together and we like di — did things together. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">If we wanted to get some bread — because we didn’t have like what the Americans did on the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> where they fed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">With the May 11, 1999 Russians you didn't have anything like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The only thing what they did for you, we would go to them and say take — let’s go to a <span class="BUILDING">German bakery</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And they would go with us and they would requisition from the baker, bread for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So we — and we, our type of eating was very crude. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Bread and water, that’s all we needed, you know, to keep us alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So that’s what we got, we got mostly bread and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Because even when we got into a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> , even if we saw some food there, you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of <span class="BUILDING">German households</span> became empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they were running towards the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So they left a lot of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> with no one there. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So when we would go in, we would find maybe some food over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I remember in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they had to spe — these beautiful, you know, like fruits, apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We were afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So we wouldn’t even touch this. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But we would have the bread from the baker and the water and that’s how we continued going towards <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Now, you would ask a Russian to requisition bread for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yeah, a Russian soldier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Were all the Russian soldiers helpful to you, or — May 11, 1999
ANSWER:  Mos-Most of the time yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">You see, they didn’t have this type o-of gan — organization like they had with the — the Americans had. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You know, what the Americans did, they found the survivors, they put them in into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they supplied food and you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to put down your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">With the Russians you had nothing like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  But some Russians 1n some <span class="NPIP">places</span> were abusive to —
ANSWER:  To women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  To women, and —
ANSWER:  Definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  — did you encounter any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  A — well, we learned to — to kind of counteract that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Let’s put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">During the day, ess — you know, I told you, we were 15 girls of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">As a matter of fact, we took out from one of these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , a horse and one of those — it was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> — not a co — you know, a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  But it’s not a b — it wasn’t a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , it was like the most beautiful si — here at the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian</span> [ walked in one time, in front was sitting this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> , you know, it was the most gorgeous thing if I would have kept it and would — wouldn’t have to had to worry about any finances because it probably was worth at — a fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But we were May 11, 1999 traveling in this horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">During the day, let’s say where we — if we were in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> during the day, we would split up a little bit and go into different <span class="NPIP">places</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in — in some kind of — what do they call them, the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> , like. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Or the pigs, or some others, because we were actually very much afraid of — of raping, because during the war, you see, 1-in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I never worried about being raped by a German, because this was something that they were not allowed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">If—if a German got caught raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So they usually stayed away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They probably were raping more German women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  What — what was that about, that they were not allowed to rape Jewish women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Oh, that’s was the — what they called the rassenschande. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Rassen, the race, schande is the — a — you know, shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  The — the — the race shame, you know, otherwise you — you like committed the worst sin. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I mean, you commit a sin when you rape anybody, but this, th — it wasn’t the raping that they were worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So after the war we did have to — the women, and I don’t — we got away — we got away kind of lucky, but a lot of women weren’t that lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  It sounds as though you also were careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">May 11, 1999
ANSWER:  Very, very, as I say. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You see, when I was liberated in ’45, I was already almost like 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You know, through the war years, you became very adept, let’s put it this way, and like self preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  So most of us were really looking out for these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">When we notice 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that there were Russian soldiers, too many Russian soldiers, that they might go out on — you know, at night, looking for women, we didn't stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We would march on. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We -— like I said, we had this horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , so we could move on a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And also, we met some Italian guys who must have been working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You know, they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And they were also like trying to get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So sometimes, you see, the Russians, if they saw you with a — with another man, they would just stay away from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  So we, during the day, we would like, if we were visible, we would go with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  The Italian guys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And then we just lost them. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Came to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we looked around what was bat — we were very much aware, and I’m really surprised — you probably heard from other people because you the first one ever asking me really, that May 11, 1999 question, how — because we were — were a lot afraid of being raped by the Russian soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  So anyhow, after — to tell you the truth, how long it took us to get to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , I really don’t know, but I figure that it must have taken us like about three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very — from the bombs, she was a little bit more in — and sh-she — you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">You know, like I had a little bit of a 1-injury, you know, like a shrapnel? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">A piece of shrapnel got into my hand, but it wasn’t — you know, I never felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You know, it wasn’t dangerous for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But with her, we had to put her in in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So she actually stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We couldn’t, you see, we couldn’t keep on staying in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for too long because we were actually afraid of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So we actually had to leave her in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but there was another friend that she met that stayed with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So she was like more or less taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But we kept on going and probably took us probably like about three weeks til we got to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And when I got there — and you know, as you were walking — you see, when we were liberated, would you believe that most of us didn’t realize that most of our families were murdered? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We still were hoping that maybe somebody’s gonna be alive because I May 11, 1999 will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, because that’s what kept us through all the other times, kept us going, because if not we probably at one time or another, we would have given up. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But that was, in a way, kept us — hey, you stay alive because you promised that we’re gonna meet at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You know, like my boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate — when they separated us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me in mine <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated — you see, never thinking that what’s going to happen, that it’s going to be this mass killing, but just separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she says, remember, after the war, we’ll meet in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So naturally, the first thing what I wanted to do is get back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">That’s how — and most of us —
QUESTION:  Back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , but by the time when I hit the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city Poznan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">That was like on germ — Polish German border. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I don’t know whether — you know, I think it’s not any more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> , I think they call it now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span> , because this became part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know, ne — I think so they call it May 11, 1999 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span> , I’m almost sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Or maybe it’s still there, I haven’t looked at the map. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Maybe after I finish this interview I will take a look at the map.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  But we got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Poznan</span> , and when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were running already. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Because you see, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was actually liberated in °44, towards the end of ’44, th — 1t — the beginning of ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were already running. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They weren’t maybe bombed as much, because they weren't bombed by the allies, the allies [indecipherable] had lots of bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I dropped — I will never forget this, I drove — I — I didn’t drive, how do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I brought this horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and left it there just like that because actually, we were 15 girls, no one wanted to go near the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I said to them, you went through such a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You’re afraid of a little horse? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I mean, he was that — he probably w-wa — I wish all through the war I would have had the dealing with the horse and — other than with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I said, and you’re afraid? </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So they were afraid to go near the horse, so I was the one that fed the horse, I was the one that took him in — now I probably wouldn’t know how to deal with it, but at the time, you know, when your life is at stake, or whatever it is that you have, I came to the conclusion that human nature, you would do what you have to do for survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  And had you had any experience with a horse before? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">May 11, 1999
ANSWER:  Never, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  So you didn’t know anything about —
ANSWER:  lwas a—I wa—I was a city girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  — handle — so you didn’t know anything about handling a horse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Never in my life —
QUESTION:  But you learned fast.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  They might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You want to know something but — there were so many people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that probably the conductor could never manage to get them that — to go and ask him for anything because you just got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and you hopped off wherever it stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And then how we stopped in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and somebody passes me by, and he actually had walked away already and came running back. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He said Reginka(ph) to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He recognized me, we were in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pionki</span> , you know, that was — we were the only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where men and women worked together, but I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And he says hey, you know that your boyfriend is alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That’s when I found out that Sam was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So I already felt a little bit better because I felt I — it’s true, ’'m going back into my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I’m going to look for my family, but at least my boyfriend is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Because by the time we were getting to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the closer we were getting, we realize more and more that our families were dead, but we still couldn’t accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  In a way it reminds me a lots of times when God forbid, you have a very si — terrible sick spouse, and you know he’s gonna die, or she’s gonna die, 1 — you just don’t want to accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And I think that was with us, you know, now that I’m — I May 11, 1999 never thought of it then, but hi-1 — but now that I’m older, I put — I can think a little bit differently than I did in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And I think most of us didn’t want to accept the idea that everybody was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So you clung to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But at least, as I say in my case, at least I knew my boyfriend, if he behaves himself and if he is waiting for me, and if he thinks of me as much as I think of him, maybe we’|I be able to get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So finally I got to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">To tell you the truth, when I got there, I don’t know exactly, but — have you ever been to Europe?</span></p>

ANSWER:  You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">When we were there, their president came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Apparently during the war he escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And I watched, for the first time in my life, I watched the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , the way they were greeting their president. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They were hanging out from their <span class="DLF">windows</span> and they were — with such love and I figured, if people can have so much love for their president, that’s how much I knew about — you know, it somehow — I always say, with g — all going through all that war, I still, when I was liberated I was still this Pollyanna, what they used to call me when I was a kid, that I could never see any bad in other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So here, I looked here at these people greeting the president and I turned around to say, they must be wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I never knew about <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> except what I learned in the history books. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I mean, after all, when the war broke out, I was 13 years old, how much did I learn about other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But I always was — loved, you know, geography and history. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So I knew a little bit about them, but I didn't know about them, but I didn't know about nature of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But when I saw them greet like this, I said you know, we should stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But you know why we didn’t? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We probably wouldn’t mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Because we heard that you had to be born there in order to become a citizen — to be a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Otherwise, if you weren’t born there, you never become a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So we were worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">What if it comes in something changes, we’re the first ones to be shipped out like they did in May 11, 1999 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to a lot of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because if they weren’t from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they shipped them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And by then, little by little we found out that the Americans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And also they — we got co — some people contacted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You know, they picked us up, we were wondering how do they recognize, but it was easy to recognize us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Well, who were the people who picked you out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  It was people that worked for the Jewish Distribution Committee, which 1s called the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And a lot of them were working also for what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and they were trying to get together the refugees, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And then they took us actually on a— on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , it was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bus</span> , a transport — er, later on — what I’ve heard lately, that because people were coming back and they gave — you know, like to Truman, you know, when Truman became president, that they gave him news that for the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it’s so bad that s-something has to be done, that they should be able to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So I— I understand that he actually saw to it that some of the <span class="DLF">borders</span> were opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">You know here, right, we thought that we did such a act that we were able to smuggle ourselves into the other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so easy, but it — apparently this was maybe already as a fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And we were taken from there, we were taken on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Yeah, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So he was working in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I got a job doing something and we got a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to — where we stayed, and whoever came to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was — that we knew, or was with — from my family or Sam’s family, they all came and they — we all stayed together in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So we wind up that my former brother-in-law came with his brother, and they —

QUESTION:  Did you know what it was when she gave it to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  You didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  I didn’t, because at that time I probably would have still would refuse to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But she wanted to show me that you can stay alive even if you eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I used to think if you eat something non-kosher that you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So the minute she says we-ell, I said oh-oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And no sooner did she say it, like everything came out of me, you know, I started throwing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But of course, little by little I got used to what they fed me, believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">That didn’t make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So — but one thing I must say, I am, even to this day, I am not as religious as I used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I believe I am — I like to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , we work for the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , you know, I believe very much in Jewish education for the children and you know, for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I worked at [indecipherable] for — I was instrumental in raising quite a bit of money for the May 11, 1999 <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Theological Seminary</span> of America in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , because I was always interested in Jewish education. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">However, I am not as religious or adherent to the kashrut, to being kosher as much as I was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Because I found out that you can live and it doesn’t have to be everything exactly kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And — and besides, I myself — had maybe my parents lived through, I would have kept it on for them, because somehow older people stick much more to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Even the survivors, the older survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But a lot of people like me that went through the war, are not as — they believe in God, but they don’t believe that the — the meat has to be slaughtered a certain way in order to be a good Jew or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So no, this they definitely changed me this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But as far, they couldn’t kill the spark for Judaism and I don’t know why it’s whether because I was so young that it really — like it, like went above me. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I-It didn’t touch me as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I always say, when you were a young kid, you don’t have the — the bonds with your family are not yet so complete that you can cope with — with these thing a little bit better than let’s say, older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I always say that had my sister survived, let’s say you know, my sister actually had a choice, you know, she didn’t have to go with her baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They actually wanted her to say that this baby isn’t mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Because you see, they needed her in the — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They liked to staff the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the doctor, a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">By then, when they were taking my sister out, they had killed off most of the doctors and the May 11, 1999 dentists and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So they had to go look for somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So they actually didn’t want her to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They actually encouraged her to say no, this is not my baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But of course she wouldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And you can imagine, if she would survive a-and she had to live with something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I mean, you can’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So as far as I was concerned, it’s true I was raised very, you know, in a way you would have been Orthodox, but not to the point where, like I have some Orthodox neighbors here. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You know, they walk around with their hats, and their — you know, th-they call them the payos in — in Jewish, I don’t know —

<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  What are they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Dreadlocks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  I don’t know whether it is the dreadlocks, but th-the kids, you know and their garment has these little things <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And my father never wore anything like this, and — he used to wear a hat, but nothing identifying him as a — as being a Jew, because he could have wear only a hat, like anybody else, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="479"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was pretty cold, so most of the time you had to wear a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">But — and my mother didn’t shave her head, she had her own hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So we weren’t that strictly Orthodox, we were a fairly Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Like here, you would have considered us Orthodox.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">May 11, 1999
ANSWER:  But now — but I was Orthodox, but I will tell you, that’s — as I say, the only thing they killed in me, about the kashrut, but the rest of me, being Jewish and loving Judaism, this they couldn’t kall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  Tell me about loving Judaism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I often think that if I had a choice, if they would have approached me — of course, I shouldn’t say this because it’s my thinking, you know, because I was never approached, but had I been approached to — that somebody would want to take me out and that’s all I had to do is take over another religion, I don’t think I would have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Now, I don’t say — I couldn’t swear to it, because I was never asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But I always felt very strong about being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Even while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">You know, we had a incident in ones of the camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">It was right after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bomlitz</span> , maybe you find —
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  Now see, you know more about me than I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I-In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bomlitz</span> that — we were under — not under the SS, we were under the Wehrmacht, which is the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And one day — and believe me, we didn’t know what holiday it was, but the same thing, they had this speech to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We know that you have a big holiday today. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It was Yom Kippur, where you fast, you don’t eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And guess what he told us? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">In the morning we used to get a portion of bread, he would say to us, you don’t have — if any of you May 11, 1999 want to fast, you don’t have to take the piece of bread now. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We will give it to you in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And we figured, you know we never trusted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We figured that they’Il probably never give us the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But you want to know something? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was amazing, I would say that 95 percent of the inmates in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> chose not to take that piece of bread, once we knew that it was Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">If they had given it to us, we didn’t know that 1t was Yom Kippur, but once we knew it — so you see, I think it wasn’t only me. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I think most of us had this spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And I don’t know whether it was our — like self preservation or we felt like, you think so great, look what you doing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">What am I gonna become, like you? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I don’t want to be like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So ee — I — ee — ing —I n—I would never, during the war, I never gave it through without much thought, you know, I never thought of it, because I w — you know what I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">That only free people have the luxury of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">People that are enslaved the way we were actually enslaved, I don’t think sit around thinking about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Mostly what you thought is about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Give me some food, you know, to fill my stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So this is another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So I don’t know whether I answered what you wanted to —

</span><span class="sentence" id="543">When I stopped running and when we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> , I became very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Yeah, I don’t know, I had something like a blood disorder. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Something — as a matter of fact, the only thing I remember 1s begging them, cut off my arms, because my arms were just like burning up. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They gave me some kind of medicine that must have had some kind of reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And this doctor came, too, who was in this — actually he was with the American army and the C.I.A. and — but he was a— a doctor from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">You know, he was — his — his birth was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So he was going around to <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , he was a very fine man and di — to visit the patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So he came — when he came near my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , he May 11, 1999 handed me a —a candy bar. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He said you don’t want?

</span><span class="sentence" id="560">And he was the one that send me papers to come, and my papers were made out not only for me, they were made out whoever is with me, because my uncle figured that if I survived, maybe there was somebody else that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But of course, nobody else survived, so I — I always tell him, you know, when I talk to the kids, they get a bang out of this, I tell them, you know, I turned around to my boyfriend, I said, if you marry me, you know you have a ticket to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and never — nobody ever refuses that. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And they think that’s very funny, but that wasn’t it, but you know, I had the papers and I was able to bring Sam with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So May 11, 1999 we c-came, actually, from the papers that my uncle sent, but the HIAS really took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">They saw to it that we got in <span class="DLF">line</span> to get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , you know, because it was very terrible that time, you know, they only allowed a certain amount of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The — the immigration laws were very, very strict in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">You had to go through — I mean, like your health and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">If you were running a little bit, a grade over, one grade over a fever, one point over what they thought it’s supposed to be, you were sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And nobody wanted to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I was sitting in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> just waiting and — and the little suitcase what I had, just didn’t want to even unpack. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I — I was just ready to go because I started telling you, we were hoping to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but in those years — you still have time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  In those years you couldn’t go into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because they had the — the British put up a <span class="DLF">blockade</span> so you couldn’t bring in the refugees, the only ones they had to smuggle them through. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So once I got married, they figured we are already taken care of, you know, the — the — the people from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that were taking care, they tried to take in the kids that had nobody, that they were single. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So to give them a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So — and since we were married and of course by then we had already the papers to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so they let us alone and they said no, we can’t 42May 11, 1999 go, So we figured we’ll come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Anything to get out from — from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  Because, you know, you learn to compromise. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">We really wanted to come to — to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , because like I told you before, we figured we’ve had enough of different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where 1-1f they decide they don’t like us, they can say go. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So we figured we’ll go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but since it became very difficult for us to go, they absolutely told us no way that we will be able to go because first of all, we were getting already, little by little, as time went on, we were getting older. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We’d gotten May 11, 1999 marry — we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We — they tried to take care of people more that were single. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Single people, most of the time, unless you had family maybe, and if —

<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  I don’t know, it came so naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It came because when we started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> — you see, and that’s what I started telling you before when you ask me whether most of my friends are survivors a-and — you see, it all depends where you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">If you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">na</span> — an <span class="REGION">area</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , where there were a lot of May 11, 1999 survivors, you didn’t have to learn to speak English, because you could get along on Yiddish — on Jewish, because mo-most of the people that had the little businesses or whatever, you got a job, they were speaking Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And the survivors that you met together, you — they were speaking Jewish or Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So we really didn’t — they didn’t need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , because we had very few survivors in this <span class="REGION">area</span> that’s came from — spoke Polish, you know, so we di — really, we’re like forced to — to — y-you have to learn or — or sink. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">A-And we didn’t like — I bet you it didn’t take us less than six months that we were able to make ourselves understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And most people, that’s why I always say that the American people are so wonderful, you know, especially in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I will tell you 1-1 — later on I was thinking to myself how — you know, my English was so bad and yet they tried so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">They wouldn’t [indecipherable] from me or anything like that, a-and they tried so hard to like stop and listen to me what I had to tell them or something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So 1-1t — it really was a pretty — as far as I was concerned, a very pleasant experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">You see, you have to realize, it’s one thing when you come to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when you leave your family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You miss them, let’s face it. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">If I would have had my whole family in powl — <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I would have come here, I was a young woman and so was my husband, I would have found it, very probably, disturbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But coming from where we came, with nobody, I had nothing to look back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">May 11, 1999
