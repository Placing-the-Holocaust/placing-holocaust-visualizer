Luigi Gambetti, with such different personality, I thought I would never make it, and for three years, it just didn’t work, and his wife wa -- he’s an MD, his wife is a Ph.D., and she came, she’s from <span class="REGION">South America</span> , and it took three years to adjust, and to this day, I go and I visit with them, I invite them for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Their daughters came in from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I was able to say, “Dr. Gambetti, I don’t understand Italian.” </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And I was able to close the <span class="DLF">door</span> and say, “You have to hear me,” because his mind was someplace else, and I was handling a lot, a lot of money on grants. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And I retired from there just in time, before -- as the health industry is changing, there’s no more Division of Neuropathology, as far as the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I had <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> work, and bulk of my work was Case Western Reserve University, because of the research, and they eventually hired another secretary, she took my <span class="NPIP">place</span> as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I ended up handling grants, and I kept screaming, “I trained to be a secretary, not a bookkeeper.” </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Finally got the stuff on the computer, and it was double work, because the computer did not communicate with the accounting department of Case Western Reserve University. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So I was projecting on the computer, and multiplying, but then I still had statements every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And I just didn’t like my work any more, because I didn’t do the manuscripts. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">You know, the word processors came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I didn’t read them over and over. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Today they are all type, they are all manuscripts more or less, change them, you know, on the word processors. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So it just wasn’t the same and the set up with the administrators who are changing, and I got out just in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I don’t think I could have survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">But I learned a lot, my mind was working and he gave me a party when I retired, Dr. Gambetti. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">No secretary had what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">He -- Dr. Russman, the ass-associate director, had a daughter who was doing, on the side or second job, or whate -- she did catering on her own, and we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">conference room</span> in one of the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Bowwell Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And he gave me a going away party with beef tenderloin, white wine, flowers, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And I know what displeased me 1s I had to invite everybody in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Institute of Pathology</span> , even the people I didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I had to think of people from Case Western Reserve that I had a lot of contact, from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I think I had about 100 - 110 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And we had a storm that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">My girlfriend from Beria never made it, they were iced in. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And they presented me with a gift certificate that just about covered a cruise, because I told -- I was so tired, I was trying to wind up everything, not to leave loose ends, be -- by the time I left, and it didn’t work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Everything changed afterwards, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And that’s the going away he gave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I went shortly after, with a tray of candy and was able to write a note, “T know it’s because of you that I had this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Today they couldn’t do it, because the money isn’t there, but that’s -- that’s what I got as a going away for retiring. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It was such a different environment than the sewing industry, especially in the small <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I worked in- in the sewing industry I worked with, at the time, many Polish immigr -- DP’s actually, who had gone through anti-Semitism, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And when you sew, your mind is not occupied, so they would tr -- you know, they would talk about different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And they- | was raised whatever I do is good enough, and I was not afraid of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I mean, tar- | was a shy girl and everything, I mean, talk about what was left, after that I just blossomed out until I wasn’t afraid of anything, and I wasn’t afraid to speak back. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And it- the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> I worked in, it was the couple who owned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He was low key, she was -- I don’t know why these people were afraid of her, she used to come down and I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The bookkeeper was an American born American, and she thought she was something better than anybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  You’re talking about the <span class="BUILDING">alteration store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  The alterations, and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , she -- I mean, I faced her -- I -- I was not -- I was not concern, I mean I just put her straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And I used -- I remember one time, I say, “What are you afraid of?” </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I says, “We all leave, they can’t keep the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> going, they need us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="804">You know, there was six or seven of us working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So, when I left there, my biggest pleasure was, as I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and working there, and I decided I had to give up the working, ya -- because I couldn’t practice my typing. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I did well in shorthand, but not in typing, and I just couldn’t keep up. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">My husband was hospitalized out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I was driving back and forth on the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And my biggest pleasure was when I went in and I was hired, through <span class="BUILDING">University Hospitals</span> , I bought a used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and I went in, because I had befriended -- her name 1s -- was Litta Ridman, she was 80 years old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And I came in with the keys, and I said -- not knowing what I was walking into, I said, “I’m secretary to the professor of neuropathology at <span class="BUILDING">Western Reserve University</span> ,” and was it Fran, the bookkeeper or was it the owner Mr. Philips, who say, “What’s neuropathology?” </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And as a foreigner, it made me feel so gra, because I don’t know why, in the small <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , they just -- they try to -- to make you look down. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And the head fitter was a German woman, Jewish woman, who knew less than I did in alterations, I guess, for some reason or other, she had learned, and really was -- at times she was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">She had a husband who had MS or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">She had problems, but I just put my foot down, because I said, “She has problems, so do I.”” And I remember a couple times, I took a gown and I threw it at her, because I knew more than she did as far -- nobody could take away the sewing from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Took me a hard time struggling to become a secretary because I was confident in sewing, but not as a secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">B-Yet after working there, it worked out all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I mean, I was confident, I was comfortable, I was respected and I worked in an environment that, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">hospi</span> -- 1t wasn’t even the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , it really is pathology, neuropathol -- you know, you get cornered in one small division -- where I was respected, and there -- there -- there ca -- there th -- you had MD’s, Ph.D.’s, and very play -- you know, nobody put on the <span class="DLF">air</span> , you were accepted, on -- on -- on -- on a same level. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So I -- I worked myself out, and I started, quote, living. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">It’s not a full life. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">My son went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kent</span> , married. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I have three beautiful granddaughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">One just graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">She is off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in va -- in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , she’s off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Alicia just turned 18, Whitney will be 16 in September, and Erica, the little one, just was Bats Mitzvahed in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I hoped to go back and forth to <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Besides, I’ve been traveling on a trip, a big trip once a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And it’s hard to see my grandchildren grow up, because I look at them and think to myself, “Oh my God, that’s the age I was that Germans walked in on that time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And things are surfacing, I guess, that maybe I pushed back, that I didn’t want to face. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I have guilt feelings, when things are very, very bad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Not lately, so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">When I’ve gone through difficult times, I have felt that I was being punished, that I deserved it, because I didn’t suffer the same as my family did. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And it -- it just happens every so often, and I think what I’m going to do now 1s try to call it quote, finalize. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I’m going to look into a trip to go [indecipherable] feeling -- and I know there’s nothing there, to go to yadva -- to -- not to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , just to get it out of my system. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And for many years, I thought, oh maybe my sister is floating around someplace, and doesn’t know where she is. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And I think, as I get older, I realize how alone I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I have no sisters, I have no nieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">My husband comes from a ra -- broken family, and I have no nieces and nephews. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">The fe -- cousins that I have -- I have one that I’m pretty close with. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">But he’s quite ill now, 1s -- as it is, their children live in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> where my son lives, all three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">But I have, as far as family, family, but I ha -- I have no close ties. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">But I have -- still have friends from -- I met when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">My girlfriend Esther, with whom I’m very, very close, died many, many years ago, of breast cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I have two of the -- the girls that I met from the sorority that I consider family. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I go there -- I -- I’m not invited, I’m expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">But what happens, we’re all getting older, so now the children are doing the holidays and it so happen they’re out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">So, my life is changing a little bit, you know, as far as that’s concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">But they’re -- they’re two friends -- I have other ones too, that I can depend on, and I consider family, but you realize, I don’t know why, it scares me sometimes, because I don’t want to get depressed, I don’t want to run into -- to the elderly lev -- you know, left alone or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And -- And to feel, you know, I do -- I do get down, but everybody does at one time or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I seem to overcome it, and I’m very thankful for what I have, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I’m comfortable financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I take one big trip, at least once a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Went to the -- a national parts la -- <span class="DLF">parks</span> last year with a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">The year before, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I have plans to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Iceland</span> in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I’ve gone with Elder Hostel, and I go for short trips to an <span class="BUILDING">Elder Hostel</span> with a friend, or I’ve gone by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Equador</span> by myself, had a strange room mate, the same thing to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and that’s about it, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But the guilt -- the guilt -- the guilt is there, the guilt is. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Although I don’t face real hard times, like when my husband was ill, and things came up, and it’s a terrible, terrible feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I used to also shudder when I used to hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , when they had the propellers, but now they have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">But I -- When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> used to go, I just -- just absolutely shuddered, but now with the prope -- with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> , you don’t get it, so I -- I don’t feel 1t any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I don’t quite have the nightmares I used to -- to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I guess I’m settling, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Trying to enjoy my grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Not one of them belongs to me, they all take after the father’s side of the family, their grandfather, and the middle one takes after her mother’s side of the family, because one 1s strawberry blonde, two redheads. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And the eyes and the shapes, there isn’t one that belongs to my side of the family, nothing’s come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But, make the best of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So, I’m not unhappy, it’s maybe not a full life, but I’m contented, make the best of it, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  I have few questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">One is, if you’re -- just talking about your idea of going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to get -- to get it out of your system --

<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  Is this kind of like saying I’m ready to -- to bury her, or did that ever happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  I -- ?'</span><span class="sentence" id="875">m -- You know, first of all, when I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , 10 years after I came - a year after my father died, my aunt brought up some of the ho-horrors, which I didn’t want to listen to. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And then people started talking about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I never -- When I talked about it, I talked about my years in hiding, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I did not talk about what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">When it really, really surfaced is when I was interviewed for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I had to bring all that up. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I had to dig in on -- oh, and I saw -- I saw Rachelle in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , spent a -- a night -- a day with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I dug into a lot of things, and then I worked with a young man, I can’t think -- I have his name written down, and he sent me -- I have the papers that show the number of th -- their records that were kept in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> , of the numbers of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And I guess -- No, I think I’ve accepted it, I just -- I just -- there’s some -- I don’t know if Pll go, but I’m going to look into it, just to -- I don’t know what good it’ll do just to -- I don’t know why, I mean it’s not going to do any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">There’s very little left, I’m aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And maybe go and see <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I don’t know why I have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">But I’ve accepted a long time ago, if you can accept some -- something like that, there’s still -- I don’t know, some feelings or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And now, with the grandchildren sometimes asking questions, it -- it has -- it has to -- it has to be accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I mean, there’s no two ways about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  What do your grandchildren ask you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  That’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Not much, not much, not much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  You were mentioning earlier that -- that one of them is particularly interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  The little one has asked me -- excuse me -- more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Sh -- I had her in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with me, by myself, and she said, “Your mother died,” or something like that, and she started asking me -- when she just did a -- a project on immigration, and I gave her all the papers, and she did ask me why I left my father, which was very hard for me to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">You know, there’s -- there were such hard feelings, there’s no -- no need to bring it up any more, it’s in -- in the past, and I just told her my father thought it was better for me to be with my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">She’s asked me more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Alicia, I guess through projects in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I remember I had to tell her something, and I can’t remember what. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Whitney, the middle one, has never asked me any questions, but that doesn’t mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">My son never asked questions either. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I did hide the pictures, because everybody had died, and yet, when he le -- heard about -- that’s how I found out about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and he told me about it, he apparently was very well aware of it, and what’s interesting is he named -- Whitney, the middle one -- I don’t know how you -- they ended up with Whitney after my mother, he said that it should always be remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And even when the girls have the Bats Mitzvah, he does bring up that my family perished in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">It’s interesting, because I was never very traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">He was not Bar Mitzahed, but he became very close with the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , and the -- the girls are very -- course, well, he became involved somehow or other, even though I never pushed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And I did all this for my children, so lot of things surfaced when I did the interviews, and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">As a matter of fact, my son, when he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kent</span> -- I didn’t mention it, when he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kent</span> , they had the Yom Kippur war, and he raised money for 1 -- for 1 -- for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He and his room mate, they lived in the <span class="BUILDING">Hillel House</span> , the Hi-Hillel had rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he -- and he’s still friends with this guy, occupied the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , the upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And they raised money for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">They made the national news as a matter of fact, because they raised money for- he had -- it was a ham operator and when he told me was president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillel</span> , I almost flipped because, I mean, you know, so I guess even though I was not traditional in keeping the holidays, so to speak, and things like that, there’s some Jewishness in him and the girls are -- went through Bats Mitzvah and everything like that, so something is projected on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And it’s hard to tell with Alicia how much she feels or how much she does or -- you never know, and first of all, they live long distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Maybe if they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it would be different, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Whitney’s the only one who never asked, but she’s the quiet one. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A

<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  I did it originally to -- to -- what made me do it, because my son wanted me to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I think until then, I did not appreciate the importance of having testimonies, you know, so that, well, the non-believers will never believe it happened, but that there should be something that -- from survivors, t-to prove that these things really existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I never thought of it in those terms before, never thought of it until Mark called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">As a matter of fa -- I didn’t think they would take my -- my -- my story, because when he first told them, I says, “Mark, they won’t be interested, because I was not 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="958">But apparently it was more than just for -- from people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , so -- but I didn’t -- I didn’t see the importance of it until -- until then. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And -- And now, with the girls getting older, the grandchildren getting older and asking questions, and things like that, I feel it’s important that there’s testimony, what it -- what will happen years later, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Look what’s happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yugosla</span> -- it still goes on, it doesn’t stop it, but at least there’s proof, whoever wants to believe it, to know that it really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And we’re slowly dying off, so there isn’t -- you know, a lot of people have died since, and cannot testify.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  I never -- I never thought of it as being important for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I only thought of it as being important for my -- for my son, and for my grandchildren, is -- I felt it was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I, for myself, I mean, no, I didn’t -- I didn’t think of it that way, anyway, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And I’m doing this also because of that, because it’s very difficult, you have to dig up memories that are very difficult, you have to dig up feelings, you have to expose your feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I don’t know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">ANSWER:  Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">QUESTION:  Well, I -- we were just talking a little bit off tape about your experience in coming to the -- to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and I wondered if you would talk a little bit about that again, about the religion question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Oh, I -- I knew I was coming to a <span class="NPIP">melting spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I mean, I didn’t understand the -- the -- the real details, or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I knew, even with the -- with the slavery, but didn’t understand the full extent of it, until I lived with it and was exposed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And when I would go someplace and fill out a -- when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lampole</span> , which is -- was a <span class="BUILDING">sewing factory</span> , one of the big ones in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , and I was shocked that they ask what my nationality was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And when I told -- I don’t remember who I told, my family, somebody, I said, “I marked <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And they said, “You should have said Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I says, “Jewish is a religion, it’s not a nationality.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I had to argue wh-why are people so conscious of what religion somebody is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I will discuss the differences if I have a-an -- an intelligent conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I worked with an Indian girl, you know, from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I worked with a Black -- what they call a-an African American girl, and that was the beginning of -- where the -- the Blacks were, you know, being absorbed, and things like that, and talk openly -- I will talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">But, people will say to me about somebody, “Are they ja -- is he, or is she Jewish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I says, “It never entered my mind to ask.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Because I take a person the way they are an-an-and I -- and I don’t think what are they. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I couldn’t understand, also, why they went into ethnic backgrounds, but I’m learning, I’m learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">It’s interesting to find what is their background, you know, where their parents came from, because those are cultures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">That I can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">We’ll discuss the -- I -- I would like to take a class in comparative religion, because I don’t know anything about the Islamic religion, and I think it’s very interesting, they all have their points. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And that is something that really amazed me, w -- and at the time, I did not understand what’s the difference what my nationality is, but now I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">It’s just -- I just took a class on immigration, through the elder campus at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tri-C</span> , and the professor was very, very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">He happened to be Slov-Slovenian? </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And he had taught at Case Western Reserve and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And we reached a point about the bilingual, the Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And I told him he opened my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I always felt, wait a minute, I spoke French, nobody bothered to have things translated in French, explain -- I had to learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Everybody who came had to learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And he pointed out to -- to us that Spanish, you take <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , they were the Spanish people, and the British were stronger, so the -- the English wa -- language prevailed, and everything Anglican took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And I looked at him, and I says -- he said, “Oh, they didn’t emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">They were forced into becoming part of the -- you know, of ameri -- part of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and the English language was dumped into them, but that’s taking away what is right for them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And I said, “Okay, now I understand, now I’m willing to accept that it should be, if necessary, bilingual.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">First of all, it wouldn’t hurt, but you think, “Wait a minute, I barely spoke any English, I had to learn English.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">But I can see their point, and I knew that the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were not paved with gold, that much I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">How hard it was to work, I don’t know, I was never made to [indecipherable] work, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> flabbergasted me, because there were rows of machines, and it was piecework, and I was used to have one garment at the time, hand finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I remember going with my girlfriend Elaine shopping for clothes and what I used to do is turn everything inside out to see if it was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And she didn’t want to go shopping, because even in those days, everything, you know, was -- was unfinished on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And I learned to -- to do piecework. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And then you had the oil that went around constantly around the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">They also had -- They didn’t have a lunchroom, per se, they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where you brought your lunch, and -- and you ate in that <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">But you have to realize in the <span class="BUILDING">sewing factories</span> , in the summertime, you worked on winter clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Wool, the lint. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And we always changed clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I had what they call wrap around, they don’t see them any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And I was just flabbergasted that that were the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I wanted to take up dressmaking and dress designing again, and the foreman, Mr. Harris, I remember his name, said to me, “Frida, don’t waste your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , you have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And then I met my husband and I got married, so I never went through with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">But I had learned through somebody about Prinz beeterman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">They made suits and coats, and they made a better garment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Some things were still finished by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And I had put an application in and I think I had put an application for hand sewing for some reason or other, and they never called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And somebody -- I ran into somebody who said they were hired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So I re-contacted Prinz beeterman, and I went to work there where the conditions were much, much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I made a lot more money by the hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I was making a dollar something at <span class="BUILDING">Prinz beeterman</span> , I went -- I mean at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lampoles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Went to <span class="BUILDING">Prinz beeterman</span> , and I went up as high as three dollars something an hour piecework. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And we had a lunchroom and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So the -- the environment was entirely -- entirely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">It was whiter, 1t was cleaner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And you have to realize, you worked in the <span class="BUILDING">sewing factory</span> , sometimes it reached a hundred degrees in the <span class="INT_SPACE">work room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">I think one of the -- 1t was a si -- a <span class="BUILDING">knit factory</span> , I can’t think of the name, they were not far from where we were on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Euclid</span> , and they moved in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , and they had air conditioning, but we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And then I was told at -- how bad it was -- I don’t know what years it was, where they had the fire in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">garment factories</span> , because of the condition and they didn’t care about their people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So these are the things that -- I think that awed me that -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And then I used to think, oh, I reached a point in my life I used to think, wonder what my life would have been if I would have stayed in <span

class="sentence" id="1141">The hardest part, financially, was when my husband was ill and hospitalized, first for six months, then he was all right for three years, went back into practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I worked for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">An -- B-But the first time with no money -- I mean, no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Two months behind in the rent, utilities, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And I had no one to turn to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I must say that the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sandusky</span> rallied, and somebody came to my -- to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ask me if I needed anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">As it is, I didn’t need it, because my husband’s brother gave us 500 dollars, we -- which helped me overcome the worst of it, and then I sold the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I didn’t make any money on it, but I salvaged some money and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , which a -- I figured, I wonder -- the rent was 90 - 96 dollars, and then they raised it 10 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And I figured, as long as the money lasts, Pll stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And it turned out all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">My husband came out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , went into practice and we got on our feet, quote, financially, and managed to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And then -- I wasn’t wealthy, but I was -- I had my head above water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And my concern was always, I left an eight year old child at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone while I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">He had no way of reaching me at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And luckily, it was through some friends who lived in the same <span

lunch, and I had a little TV tray -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> so he could have it, and years, years later, I -- some people would made comment because he went to <span class="BUILDING">Kent State University</span> , and when he’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I would have a glass of milk, and I would have a sandwich wrapped, and people used to make comments about it, and I said, “You didn’t have what I had, where I had to leave a child to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to an empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I hate when -- I -- I like when people have comments, and my daughter-in-law teased for the longest time, because Mark was terrible in the morning, I couldn’t get him out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And the only way I could get him to sit up wa -- I used to squeeze fresh orange juice, and I would go and say, “Mark,” and I would hand him a glass of orange juice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And that got -- that got him sitting up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">But the -- the financial difficulties were really, really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I don’t think I thought of that time of even going back or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I also -- There were some hard feeling that I n -- that I never, never cleared my mind, is my father adored children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">He never came to see his grandson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I did want to go back, and they offered me the fare for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> or something, but I never told my father that I didn’t have any money and how badly I was struggling financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">When I went back a year after he died, my uncle -- my father’s brother Josef was still living, and she said, “Why didn’t you ever tell your father?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And I guess I had too much pride. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I never told him, I

QUESTION:  Did you -- This is tape number three, side B. Did you ever see your father again then, after you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">It was a Friday, early in the morning, we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sandusky</span> , and I got a phone call, it was the <span class="BUILDING">telegram office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Didn’t speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">My uncle was sending me a telegram, and they said in French, “Ton pere decee,” and that’s when I screamed, because they were saying my father was deceased, and I screamed, and my husband came to the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I had no money, I had no passport, and I never went, I never saw him again, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And I went back a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And I went -- I saw his widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">I found out that my father was very unhappily married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">He had imported a woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">You know, must say this, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , the Americans thought Europeans were not discriminating because, well, we had a couple African from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium Congo</span> , but you didn’t have the discrimination against the Black population, like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But you wonder why there is a war going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">My father wouldn’t have touched a Polish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">The -- The Czechs didn’t like the Polish, the -- the Polish didn’t like the Lithuanian, I mean the -- 1-1-1t’s th-the ethnic background, it’s amazing, it does exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And she told me he never wa -- came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">He walked around with my mother’s pictures and my sister’s pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And I went in to see her because my father had a ring from my mother, and I wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And I thought, if she’s wearing it, I was going to take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">She wasn’t wearing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And they had a couple things that were salvaged from -- I guess when my mother was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I don’t even know who stored them, never found out, never asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And I guess everything came, and I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> because my Uncle Josef had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , and the only family I had was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">But I had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Li¢ge</span> because my father, very shortly, maybe two weeks before he died, had made out a will leaving everything to his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And I found out that in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> you cannot disinherit a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">S -- Thr-Through a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liége</span> , I -- with whom I was still corresponding, she got me a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I got a few dollars, not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I did go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , but I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , because my uncle was there, but the lawyer was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And of course, I walked in on my father’s widow, and she did not know I was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And I guess walking and seeing just a -- a couple personal belongings -- she did give me the linens my mother had made by hand, I still have them, as her trousseau when she was a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And Ill never forget I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and it was dusk, and I was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And my aunt came in, and she says, “What are you crying like an imbecile?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And I just could not -- I could not relate to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">She’s -- I don’t know, she raves about her -- she’s crazy about her son, her daughter, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And th -- She doesn’t have the warmth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And she went through -- after they started picking up the Jews, they ended up in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">They did have a hard time, they didn’t go out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , because -- I remember they said in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they deported the Hungarians, so they said they were Czech, and then the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they said deported the Czech, so they said they were Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">So they managed to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">They had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And I don’t know what kind of camps they were, because I never asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Her -- My aunt’s family, she had a mother, a father, two sisters and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">When the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- see, we tried to go to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we didn’t know they were going to invade <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , her family got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and the whole family was killed from the bombing, from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">But yet, when I fell apart at the seams and came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , and I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I just couldn’t -- I couldn’t explain to her, I was exposed to -- t-t-to -- to -- to my war years, to -- to -- to -- you know, living in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I put everything in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I -- I -- I guess maybe I did it intentionally, I didn’t think of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">You push something out of your way, push things out of your mind, didn’t face what really happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And here I was, and I went back and all this faced me, and everything surfaced, and she just couldn’t -- I don’t think she could appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So that’s the hard time I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And I did tell her -- she wanted to know why I didn’t come as soon as my father died, because we had a business, and his widow emptied th-th-the stocks and things, so she didn’t pay the taxes the way it should, and I -- who even thought of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">As difficult a time as I had with my father after the war, he was a fantastic father as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">During the war he -- he -- we -- we had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">My father did <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">We never went hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">He -- When he used to - to go to the farmers and bring eggs and butter and salt on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and -- and sell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">We never -- We never went hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So, what happened after, was the effect of whatever happened to him that maybe didn’t appreciate at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Now that I have th -- what I know is guilt feelings, because you survived, I think maybe he had guilt feelings of having survived untouched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Maybe it would have been different if he had gone out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and survived, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">But as I matured and got older and faced the truth what happened, maybe he had guilt feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I don’t know, he never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And then, when my Uncle Gesa came, and I used to visit him quite often, I used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> about twice a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Went with Mark, then went by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">After surgery I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And I used to say to him, “Why didn’t he come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> to see his grandchild?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And he just raised his shoulders and never answered, so I don’t know -- I don’t know why he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">As a matter of fact, my cousin Miriam told me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> that he was very good to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">He was very good to her, and what happened, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">As children, I mean, we were provided for, we had caring parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I don’t wish any more on any other child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Financially, we didn’t have much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I didn’t know what a doll was, I don’t think they ever bought me a doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I think the dolls I got was from the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , at Christmastime used to give -- I remember I had a doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">You have to remember they were the breakable dolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And I remember I put it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">window sill</span> , and there were some lu -- leftovers from the sewing my mother did, and the thing pushed the doll away and the doll broke, but they never replaced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bicycles</span> we had, because we needed it for transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And after my accident -- I had an accident before we went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I went out to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with my sister Berta and another friend, and I don’t know what happened, we went ou -- I remember going uphill, and we had to walk and it was a hot day, and I wanted to sit down, and I -- I can’t place it this time if my sister said it, or the other girl said it, they say, “Oh, Frida, now the <span class="DLF">hill</span> goes down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and I remember as if yesterday -- I don’t remember if it’s my sister or the other girl, yelled, “Frida, you’re losing your pedals.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I fainted and I went down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> in a fainted state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">I guess th-the power of rolling down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And I went into -- I don’t know if it was -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , I don’t know if it was a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And it was somebody of aristocracy, and they brought me back with their chauffeurs, to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And I remember they gave my mother smelling salts, because one side of my face was damaged, and I must have had a slight brain concussion, because if somebody moved a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> or something, I couldn’t take the noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And my mother didn’t wanted me to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">My father went -- somehow or other found a second hand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , so, you know, things were not produced, and I got another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So I had that accident, and then I had an accident three days before my birthday, my 17" birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">But whatever could be provided for us, schooling, we had private tutors to help us more, but not the arts, or music or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">First of all, I was not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Berta

<p><span class="sentence" id="1282">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">When my uncle died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , and two years later, my aunt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">I didn’t know at the time, but I was the executor for both wills. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">One of the heirs, my aunts nephew, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , who was Communist at the time, managed to manipulate the money so the money didn’t go into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and I was in correspondence with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And somehow or other, I decided to go to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Dr. Freide was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> at th -- at the time, in a -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And I was in correspondence with him because there were still some strands left behind, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And I wrote to him I was going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and he said, “If you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , we’ll show you the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">So what I did, I traveled on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">He did offer for me to stay with them and I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">They got me a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> you don’t get through the travel agencies here, and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> is very clean, so I got a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and you could tell the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> was added on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And I had breakfast and I took a couple trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">So I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> for two days, took some trips, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1296">QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  When did my uncle die? </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">Let’s see, 20 -- [indecipherable] died about 20 -- 22 -- about -a good 20 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I don’t have my passport and I don’t remember exactly the year, but it’s t -- about 20 years ago, and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , which is Communist at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I had to have 10 dollars per day, couldn’t spend it, the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">And I stayed with my -- with Eugene and Magda, my aunt’s nephew and niece. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Didn’t see much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Spent a week there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , which was a waste of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Willy, my cousin, took me to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">I had spent three months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , I had no desire to see it, I didn’t do -- oh, I did take a trip into the Flemish part, on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">It was -- I have no -- I grew up feeling as a Belgian citizen cha -- chain -- sang the national anthem, and then after I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I realized I really would have never been a citizen, although my father died shortly before becoming a citizen of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">You don’t become automatically like in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And then I went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to see Frida and spend a week with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And then I -- And then I came back here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And then, let’s see, did I go back again? </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">No, I was out, I never went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I have no desire to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">I know Miriam said to me, “Why don’t you go work for the common <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">You’re bilingual.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">By then I was losing my Fre -- when I say losing my French, I excelled in French, but to speak two languages, and translate, are two different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">You need a training and a background, and I have to stop and think, “How do you say that in French?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I finally met some people, quite by -- was just a freak, I took the Rapid to go downtown and this woman sat next to me and she had a little brochure, and I says, “Oh, I didn’t know the Americans were interested in Moliere.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And she happens -- I don’t know where she learned French, but she introduced me to a group, and they’re strictly women, we get -- they get together twice a month, at Beechwood Place, and from 10 to 12, and then on Friday they get together at somebody’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and everybody brings something, just for the purpose of speaking French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">So I’ve gotten back into speaking French, and it’s not a word of English, until you turn to somebody who just came back from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , who has close contact, and you say, “How do you say such and such in French?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Nobody could remember how to say flush a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And I read French books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">I go down to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> about once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324"><span class="BUILDING">Cleveland library</span> downtown, the main <span class="BUILDING">library</span> is magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">I have -- going to go down next week, I think, because they built a new <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and they re-did the old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was closed, and I got to know -- they had a -- the <span class="BUILDING">foreign literature library</span> , and she just sent me a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">She knows the authors I like, or if she sees a book on <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , she’Il send it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">One of them she sent me was all about the percentages of Catholic -- Cath -- Catholicism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Still have some words with trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">So I do that, and I do have the opportunity of getting together with people to speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And my granddaughters are taking Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">But they’re long distance, you know, so it doesn’t make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">As a matter of -- th -- Alicia called me, she said, “I have to take a language, I don’t know what to take, maybe German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And I didn’t want to tell her don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">I did say, “Oh, [indecipherable] you don’t want German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I said, “[indecipherable] to take French,” I said, “but take Spanish, it’s much more useful, you know, in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">So I don’t know what she’s going -- she’s going to do what she wants to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">She said something about taking Japanese, but she’s not going into something where it would be required, so I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">But I do speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">I have very little opportunity to speak Yiddish, and I trip on my words, bring in the English words, because the older generation is dying away, so the young people -- I’m sure my little sister probably didn’t even speak Yiddish, probably understood it, but the young generations don’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">We have a lot of Russian emigrants, but the Russians are like the Germans, they don’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Best of all, they couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Every so often I find them, and I'll say, “Do you speak Yiddish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">So I can communicate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And maybe I’Il break down -- I think Workman’s Circle has classes in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Maybe I should go back to it, maybe it’Il come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">I just remember a couple letters of the alphabet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Don’t know what good it is, but I did read articles that in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> they’re te -- teaching Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">In my generation they always said, “A Jew can go anywhere, he’s never lost, as long as he speaks Yiddish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">But it’s not true any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">In my generation, when I was young, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">It did come in handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> twice, the first time on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">I was going to take a tour, and some reason or other, I remember my cousin, the one who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , as a soldier, I remember his address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">They were pioneers on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">And I wrote to him, and I said, “I want to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I want to take a tour, but I’d like to see you again and meet your family.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And he said, “Don’t take a tour, come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">So I went on my own to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , I arrived on a Friday, before sundown, and on Saturday, my mother’s side of the family came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">My mother had a niece in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And through the family I got her sister’s address and they all invited me, which I didn’t accept, but they grabbed me off, and I was taken to -- to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">I took one tour, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">Everybody else took me around, and then I went on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and lived on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and got a taste, if you can, on a couple days at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Then I went back a number of years later -- oh, that time I traveled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">It was marvelous, because you meet more people, you learn more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> back from ji -- di -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and they dropped me off into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and my uncle had shown -- my cousin had shown me, “See Frida, this is the <span class="DLF">street</span> I live on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And I said, “Sfee, you want me to remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">It’s in Hebrew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">So when I got off on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , there was a man with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he was a-a-an older man, and I looked at him, and I took a chance, and he was one of the Europeans from that generation, who had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I was able to speak with him in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">So he took me to my cousin’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">The second time I went, I went as a volunteer for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">I didn’t like the experience, and the thing that saved me is every weekend we were off, so I went to the different -- to the various members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">I didn’t tour as -- that much, this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1372">QUESTION:  A volunteer for the Israeli army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1373">ANSWER:  Y-Yeah, uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">They needed volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">That started during the -- one of the wars or something, where all their people were fighting, and they needed people, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And I ended up working -- I ended up being placed on a ca -- on an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> that was -- packed medical supplies for the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">My cousin from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , her granddaughter happened to be in the army, right on the next camp, next to it, where the soldiers were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Teela. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">She was an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And she came and she found me, because I had written to them that I would be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And we got a ride back to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then coming back we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">Some experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">So I stayed there for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I didn’t extend my trip, but I did go to my cousin’s kibbutz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And I just had -- something came up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , and I was in contact with what I call my sabber cousin, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And he called me twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">I recognized his voice, they have a definite ang -- you know, they speak English fluently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And he says, “Why don’t you come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I says, “You know, maybe you make me feel like going, but I want to see <span class="REGION">areas</span> where I’ve never visited before.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">So I decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Iceland</span> in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">I don’t know wha -- what I -- I understand is very beautiful terrain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">Equador was very enlightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">People say Equador? </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">What’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Equador</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Well, it’s different cultures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">And that’s what I like to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">And whether I’ll go to <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">One t -- One- One step at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">First of all, I have to make sure -- I’m getting older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">That’s why I walk, to keep my legs active, and make sure --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1407">QUESTION:  And did you -- did you s -- s -- tell me about your visits with Rachelle when you returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">ANSWER:  Ah, the first time I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">What happened is, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> the year after I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">When I went <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And my aunt in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was the same age as Rachelle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">My aunt didn’t like Rachelle either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">And she gave me Rachelle’s name -- she had remarried, and her address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">And I wrote to Rachelle, and some reason or other -- trying to remember if I didn’t get an answer, somehow or other, I got the answer three months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I found the letter after I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And everywhere I went, I kept saying, there is somebody I want to see, but I can’t read the Hebrew telephone books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And I ended up at a cousin’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that I had not met before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">They were brothers and sisters from the one who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and I didn’t know they were brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leelee</span> -- Leelee’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , on the

she says, “Okay.’’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">Somehow or other, I don’t know if she called information, she looked in the phone book, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And I say, “I can’t call on my own, because I don’t speak Hebrew, and the Europeans who had gone, did not speak English.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">Now they all -- all -- all the Israelis speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">And she got on the phone one evening, and in Hebrew, and she said, “Frida, it’s the right Rachelle.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">And I got on the phone, she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">And what I did is I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and I stayed with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">I did not sightsee, I did not do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And I remember, had a dress with a little breast pocket, and I was going to a <span

I had told, I says, “Sally,” I said, “I don’t care what, I want to see Cindy and Sharon.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And one lived in a remote <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> that was just being established. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">My cousin Sfee borrowed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and took me there and just visited for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">But Sharon was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> where I had access with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and Rachelle put me in a <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1432">I have money, I can afford.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">She insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">And she spoke -- I don’t know if she picked up some Arabic, or 1t was in Hebrew, she put me in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , because all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> leave from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">And I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , it was -- my son had warned me, it was like letting lions out of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">Saturday evening, the Sabbath is broken, and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> were lined up right behind the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">I mean, the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> has been remodeled since, when I went the second time. </span><span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1442">The soldier saw me, you know, with a little suitcase, and he approached me, and I told him where I was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">It
