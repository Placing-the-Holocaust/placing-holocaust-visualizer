<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I was from, I believe about til -- from 1939 -- I know I was there til October the 27 -- I do remember one -- vividly one day, October the 27", 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We were -- up til then we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and October then came and they came out on the loudspeakers early in the morning, they banged on our <span class="DLF">doors</span> with the rifles, scared to death, early in the morning, raus, raus, everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Where we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">To the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Everyone had to leave the area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And we had to wait for the people to come over at night for the night shift, I wa -- I had the night shift from 11 to seven in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">When I came December 20, 1999 from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> they did not take us back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we went right to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">In the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> we all had to stand around it until -- from five a.m., I would say about til three in the afternoon, until -- til the selection started. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They -- they started picking the -- before that even, people were coming towards the -- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> towards the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It was a little distance, I don’t know exactly the amount of the distance, but on the way there they were -- the Germans were screaming loud, schnell, fast, fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And children would get separated from their mothers, and you could hear the children screaming Mom, they were screaming for their mothers, the children -- and the mothers would scream for the babies, they got lost for a second or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It caused a lot of turmoil to -- to -- to get all these people lined up in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And they finally did line them up with the selection and that guy -- we stayed, and he would say left, right, left, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And of course, th-the old -- the old ones, the old people and the real young, they would take them right over to one <span class="NPIP">section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They didn’t go right, left, they just take them over, you -- looked at you, you were old, over to the section. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">If you had children, over to the section. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I had one of my sisters with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">She held onto them, both girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That was the -- my sister’s named Reisl. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">She held onto the two children with my mother, they held on, stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">My other sister worked at night with me, Faige. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We came in the morning, so the child was with my grandmother -- with the December 20, 1999 child’s grandmother, which was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And when the child saw her mother, she was screaming for her, she wanted her mother, but her mother -- she started running over to the mother and the German would start hitting her, kicking [indecipherable] back to the grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">He would not let her go over to the sister -- to -- to -- to my sister, which was the child’s mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And the ch-child was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">She finally quit crying and my -- my mother, which was the child’s grandmother, held onto her. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Until this was lined up and I would say at -- by five o’clock it was -- everything was straightened out. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They took the old people and the real young and marched them towards the <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And the people that they picked, the younger ones, they looked like the ones that had already jobs and the ones that didn’t have jobs, but they looked young, strong, were moving over to one <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And after the old ones marched away from us, then they started on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They start lining us up again, checking us over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And on the way when the people left towards the <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> we could hear screams going on, we could hear the rifle shootings were going, maybe they shot in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , I don’t know, but there was a lot of commotion going on until these people were settled towards the <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And ones then they -- we heard they packed them in and we heard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the noise of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> and we knew they were heading away. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We didn't know where they were going, we never did know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They went to us, they lined us up December 20, 1999 again and they told us five in a row, and line up, and the Germans were standing there, and -- with the guards and the Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">They even had the Lithuanians with them, too, who joined the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Those were also no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And they lined us up and they told us to march, start marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And we marched. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And you had little satchels with you, they told you to take whatever you want with you, so you gra -- how much did I have? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I had a little satchel with me, I don’t even know what was in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Mother packed it for me, she said you take this with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So wis -- when we were heading towards the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> where they told us to go to march -- and on the way they kept beating us too, we didn’t walk too fast, then they told us to jog. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And it was all uphill. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we were heading for was six and a half kilometers from the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">It was hot to -- October, very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Usually it’s cool already, but that was a very hot October. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We didn’t have anything to drink from five a.m. in the morning [indecipherable] to drink, no water, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And on the way they kept beating us and -- and some people were falling down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Then they beat them up and they made us lift them up again and walk with them, he-helping them along. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We finally did come to the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> and we looked and there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And we were not aware of it in this outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that they built -- in fact, there was two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They took one bunch over to one <span class="REGION">sa -- area</span> , to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and one to another, was two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And December 20, 1999 that was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitslager</span> , the -- what they call a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They -- they didn’t have any electric wires around us, they had regular barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But they had the guards on the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> and they had guards below. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And that was a surprise for us, I suppo -- we didn’t even know what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They built it secretly. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We knew nothing of [indecipherable] of it until we go -- finally got there to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeaker</span> again out, and he says everybody achtung, achtung whatever their name is and whatever they said, and they said empty your pockets, all that -- what you bring with you, dump into a little box, there’s a box sitting there on the side, and the satchels went into the box. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">There was another box, they said, take all your jewelry, all money, dump it into this other box. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And you’d better aboi -- abide by it because you will get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So we all listened, of course you had to do it, otherwise you don’t want to get killed over there, so you search yourself, make sure you don’t have a nickel left. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Empty your pocket, you empty it, everything, with the jewelry and threw it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They pile it [indecipherable] behind the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and assigned us to different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We came into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and all they had was empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Was nothing over there, just wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They put us three to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">It was, I think, three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> high. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And --and they had nothing, no water, not a thing for us, just shoved us into those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And we didn’t get out from those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> until five a.m. in the morning the following December 20, 1999 morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">The -- the -- the loudspeaker again, aus, everybody aus, aus, aus, aus. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And then they would give us the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">The ones who had jobs working in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , line up to one <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So we all knew where, you know, we were already [indecipherable] so we stood in one <span class="REGION">area</span> , then he filled in others with us, then they marched us towards the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">As we came into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we were- they’re like a -- a -- a herd of cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We were walking in and they were stand with the long whips and they’re beating on us [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And the overseer with the SS man was right there with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">With the dogs barking and screaming, grabbing your legs if you didn’t walk fast enough, or your clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And I remember there was this shouting shout [indecipherable] we didn’t walk fast enough to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And that was a regular ritual with them, in the morning to go 1n we gota beating and then when we left we got a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Either way we didn’t walk fast enough [indecipherable] a good excuse, because we were all bunched up in one <span class="REGION">area</span> , trying to get through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> so that we can go about -- to march back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and we’d always get beatings over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And then, you know, once we got up to the -- inside the factory compound, we all knew where our <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And the new ones were assigned to the <span class="REGION">areas</span> wherever they assigned them to. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And we stayed there in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> til almost -- I would say til 1943, or -- or the beginning of °44, we stayed in that Arbeitslager. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And there too, typhus broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Very bad December 20, 1999 typhus, I had it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I lost a sister that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">One of my sisters, Chaja, they drove in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> one morning before I came back from work, the night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And seven o’clock instead of letting us into the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they would let us in between the barbed wire, like six feet apart or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And all of us had to stay in the barbed wire til the two truckloads came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And these were supposedly going all infected people with the typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And we no longer saw them after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That’s -- I lost one sister right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Of course, the others, in the beginning when we had -- when the -- what do you call it, the -- when they took everybody, the old and the young away, in the beginning I lost a sister there, too, in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But that’s how I lost one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The other sister, my t -- the -- the one that was two years older than I was, she came down with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And they had, believe it or not, so to speak, a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span> , on one side, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span> on the other side. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">No blanket, no nothing to cover yourself with, just plain old wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And I still til today don’t know why they didn’t kill her and why they let her stay in that little <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">She stayed there -- I would check on her every morning when I come in from work, whenever I got off I would always go in to check on her, see how she is. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And one morning I came in, she was no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So I went up to the Jewish policeman which I knew, and I said -- his name was Muttle, Muttle Hilf. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I said -- I ran into him and I said, Muttle, what December 20, 1999 happened to my sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">He said, she died during the night and we already buried her in the bottom of the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> [indecipherable] a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> , and we buried her there, but the two -- one that was two years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I was only left with one more sister in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> Faige. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I lost her too, as we going to come into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We stayed there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> then we -- the -- the Russians advanced a little bit from the east coming in, and then we could hear the artillery pounding already and we knew something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So my sister Faige and this Jewish policeman got together, and there was another Jewish policeman who -- his name was Moishe Herblum, he was sort of related to us, a distant cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">She and him got hooked up to work out some way that we going to try to escape from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the shift -- that -- that shift I had from three to 11 that e -- in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Came <span class="BUILDING">home 11</span> , she looked me up, my sister and she says, we’re going to escape tonight, don’t tell anybody, no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I said, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So she -- I said, when am I going to know when to run? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She says, I'll come and get you. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So she says, just be ready, stay in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> in -- of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I'll come and get you. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">She and the policeman came along and got me. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">By that time other people knew it already too, because I saw a lot of commotion, people were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And somebody got into the -- to the barbed wire and cut through the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And as we were running, the ike -- the cue was if the lights are off, we run. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So the lights were off. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So December 20, 1999 the people what their mission was to cut the wires, they did the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And a lot of people was -- tried to fight through that little <span class="REGION">area</span> to get out, and they got entangled to one another, and a lot of commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">By that time the guard heard a lot of -- more noise going on, so he took the lights and put the searchlight towards that <span class="REGION">area</span> where he heard the noise and he saw people were running out. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He opened fire and I was running with my sister and the Jewish policeman together, and I got hit in the head, wounded, and I dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">My sister, after I dropped I don’t know what happened to her, o-or to the policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I know people were running back, the lights went on and people were running in every direction, in, out, in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Somebody jumped on me with a [indecipherable] and put a scar on here, I was bleeding from here, I was bleeding from my head until I -- they were stampeding me. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So I finally woke up and came -- a few seconds, I came up to myself, I said -- I started screaming for my sister, Faige, Faige, and I didn't hear from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So I said to myself, why don’t I go into he -- the <span class="BUILDING">women’s barrack</span> and look for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So, I was a little bit disor-oriented, I didn’t know which -- I lost a lot of blood, and I did manage to go into the <span class="BUILDING">women’s barrack</span> , which she shouldn’t have gone in, but I took a chance, I went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">The -- the lady in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was one of our Jewish women from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so I knew her, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So I figured she’s not going to bother me too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I went, Faige, Faige in th -- in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , no Faige. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So my -- my first cousin, December 20, 1999 Ida, she was my first cousin, she says, what are you sh -- she says, what are you looking for? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was looking for Faige, have you seen Faige? </span><span class="sentence" id="470">She says no, she’s not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And then she saw I was bleeding [indecipherable] from my head, so she grabbed that shirt, dipped it in some water [indecipherable] I put it on my head, tried to stop the bleeding, and -- and I couldn’t leave that <span class="BUILDING">women’s barracks</span> that night, I had to stay overnight there, underneath th-the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , I squeezed myself underneath there. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And she told me to hold this over my head, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And then- because all night long they were -- they were angry that we were trying to escape, so they were shooting all night long into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with the -- with the rifles, boom, boom -- with the machine guns, boom, boom, boom, boom, all night long, until early in the morning it stopped, I snuck out of there and went into -- back to my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And three days later the rumor was sure, that we are going to be shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">My sister didn’t tell me that, but that’s the reason they wanted to escape, because we going to be shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And one to the other was talking, they said here we helping, actually, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Everybody has a job, we work in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , and all kind of copper foundries, each one had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We were actually helping the Germans, and if they ship us out of here, where can they take us? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">To probably [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So my sister was trying to escape with me and the policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Now, the rumor later was December 20, 1999 around, saying that the underground was supposed to have met us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There was - the way they worked it out, they wouldn’t tell me anything about it, they didn’t want me to know, in case I get caught or something, so I don’t have nothing to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">It was all arra -- arranged with the partisans, who were supposed to meet that- at 11 - 12 o’clock in the night, and to eliminate the guard and knock the lights out. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And it so happened there was an air raid, so the lights went off anyway, and there was -- got a little bit mixed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It so happened that the -- the partisans never showed. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Maybe they got some problems, they never showed. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So we proceeded with our stuff that we said we going to do, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So, a lo -- some of them did escape, I don’t know how many, so the next morning roll call they wanted to see how many escaped, so they chased everybody out from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they would start to count the names and the -- and they marched us over to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where -- where we were trying to escape, we cut through the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And right in the front of us there was the policeman, wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">My sister was there, but she was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But there was about, I would say 10 - 15 people laying there, moaning and moaning and groaning, blood -- lot of blood flowing around and -- and they made us look and they took the machine gun and killed every one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And they said this is the lesson that you will learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">If you escape, that’s what will happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So from now on, stay put, December 20, 1999 don’t -- don’t escape any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And this is the lesson that we learned right there. </span><span

ANSWER:  The head -- the chest wound they couldn’t see cause I wore the jacket on top, you know, th -- they couldn’t see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">But my head wound they could have seen, but we were -- we had ba -- you could wear anything you want on your head, a beret, or a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Then wa -- in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it wasn’t where you had a striped uniform yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We didn't get that til later, we were wearing our ra -- normal clothes, a pair of pants and a shirt, whatever you had, you wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So I had a beret and I covered it up, and they didn’t see it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And of course I washed everything away from the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And they didn’t check me over at all until I got to the destination where -- I’m going to tell you where I came to, and then they asked questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  How did these wounds heal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  The wounds did not heal until I was liberated in 19 <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> -- April 25", 1945, I [indecipherable] 1945 of April the army medics, U.S. medics treated it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">It would get infected and re-infected, infected and re-infected for so long a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Only time it felt good, when you took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , finally they let you get -- washed it, so the scab washed off and then the new scab came on the -- of course, you know with December 20, 1999 the sanitary conditions being so bad, that infected again, so that’s what I said, didn’t heal up til I was heal -- til the vet -- the army medics helped me after the war, after I was liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  When this wound was not healing properly, did you have pain and fever?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  I would get a lot of headaches from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Until today I still feel headaches, I think it’s maybe contribute to that, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Whether I got fever, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I did get typhus, I had fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So I’m aware of what -- what fever is, but you know, you had so many other problems, this was just a little minor thing in your life, other than the wound, you know.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Were there other Jews from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Yes, there were some other people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> ou-out of towners too, yes, because they kept brining in extra people every -- every week, every day they brought a few extra ones in. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And some of them looked pretty strong when they came in already to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> towards the end, we were already weaklings. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We’re not skeletons yet, but we were [indecipherable] weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They were still strong, they came from some other <span class="NPIP">part</span> maybe, where they were not mistreated yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And so they- when they came into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , then they learned a lesson right there, they gave it to them the same treatment we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And people were losing weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But it wasn’t just -- Just as bad, you could still survive, yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They were just threatening us, saying if we would think about again escaping, this w-would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But before that -- before that, the order was, one had to watch the other, because sometimes we did have escapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And they would take just five out, innocent people, and kill them because this one person would escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They did that in the beginning when we went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to be told- they were telling that over the loudspeaker, every day we heard that. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But during that time they just killed -- they -- they just killed the wounded that were trying -- December 20, 1999 that were on the other side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , which escaped, they were already on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  While you were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> did you have any idea of what was happening elsewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Not really, no, because we couldn’t talk to the people who were on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the non-Jews, they wouldn’t tell us nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Not me, let’s put it this way, I can’t speak for the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , maybe somebody did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I did not know what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But towards the -- later on we heard stories that -- not until I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I heard that -- the rumors what went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that comes to your mind about this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , before we leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  Well, before we left this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is -- the only thing I can remember, how they were doing, they -- they came out -- we had like sobriety tests like we have here for somebody who drinks and drives. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The policeman stops you and they make you walk to a straight <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And they -- there was one German there, his name was AI -- Alto, that’s the only name I remember, how it’s possible that you could only remember one miserable man, because he was very bad, he was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And he was a heavyset man, and I remember he’d come in and everybody who was in the shift -- the worst shift by the way, was night shift, because that means you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And all the trouble started during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">If they needed extra help they December 20, 1999 would come in and drag you out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and go do extra work, plus he makes sure he brings you back so you can go on the regular shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We might put that day on 16 hours or 17 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And that was the worst shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But he would come in during the day and have everybody <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and he would -- like target practice, he would have you walk a straight <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">If he knew you were sick in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> -- so-sometime you would see people laying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with foaming from their mouth from the high fever from the typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I had the typhus too. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So-Some -- sometime maybe [indecipherable] or heavy, I don’t know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">My sister, the one who died, she had typhus, but for her, hers turned into the tu -- tuberculosis I think it turned into, she never recovered, she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They let her die on her own. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">That was in the a -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And what -- he would bring them 1n and he made you walk a straight <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">If you did -- if you wiggled a certain way, he would put a bullet in the back of your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And this was like ta-target practice for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And he had other accomplices come with him, to show them what he is doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Trying to show them that gee, he could do that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">To harden them up, I guess, like weren't hard enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I remember one of my neighbors, his name was Luther, I don’t know his last name, he was my -- my age, and he had a bad case, cause he was foam -- I remember seeing him in the morning, he was foaming from the mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And he would tell us to go out, so we had to leave, you could not stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> or he would December 20, 1999 kill you in your -- in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> if you stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And he -- that’s how he died, because he was wiggling when he was walking, his fever was so high that he could not walk straight <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So therefore he shot him in the back of the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">This is the only one that I saw him shooting, by the way, but he would do that every so often, every so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I remember this young man when he was my friend, he was my neighbor before, we were living near each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We were the tailors and they were the carpenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Yeah, we knew each other pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Before the escape attempt, had their been any deportations from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  No, they would only bring people in, not -- not out, just bringing them in, they were bringing extra people in from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , but who -- I never see anybody leaving there until they deported everybody out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Tell me about the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  The liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> like I say, after we tried to escape and three days later the rumor was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">My sister didn't want to tell me, but then we found one another to see how they -- the people were trying to work this out with the -- with the partisans somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And they pulled up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was maybe a block away from the -- from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We could see the <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> from far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">You know, it wasn’t that far, 1t wa -- maybe it was longer than a <span class="DLF">block</span> , but we could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And one day they told us to line up in the morning, and December 20, 1999- and march towards the <span class="DLF">railway yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Well again the beatings [indecipherable] on the way it was the same thing, that we would walk past the -- it was constantly beating, beating with the long whips, just like -- just like the cowboys here with the herd of cows trying to round them up, it’s constantly beating, beating, beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">When we finally came towards the <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> they started to line up people. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">See, you go -- to what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> to go into, push them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And we were packed in, 125 to 150, I would say, approximately to 1 -- to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They would set us down between each other’s legs so that we could fit more in. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And then once was full, he s- closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> up and sealed it up so no one can open it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And they finally, after leaving and we got through, we finally pulled away, we could hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> , the noise of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> and we were heading out, we were three days on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">No water. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We stopped at every <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We didn’t know where we were going, but we stopped in so many <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> , I know, because this was not a priority <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the army has to go through first, so there was -- they let everybody else go, but we stopped in so many <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> , and in unison, I remember we were screaming, wasser, wasser, wasser, and the Germans know what wasser means, because in their -- German language | think it’s the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">We didn’t ask them to feed us, all we asked, water, water. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">No water was given, nothing at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">We finally did arrive -- we finally did arrive at the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> in three days fa -- after three days December 20, 1999 you finally arrived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it was very scary for me personally, with -- to see all these electric wires with the -- with the current would kill us, with seven foot tall, they had to be at least, or 10 foot tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It was a different ballgame there. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And as we were looking through the barbed wire, we saw people walking around with skeletons, with thin and striped cap and a striped uniform an-and wooden shoes, we already saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But the people who came to meet us in the front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , they pushed those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And they came and told us in Yiddish that this is [speaks Yiddish here] we were burning, we were burning the Jews here. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">This 1s not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , this 1s strictly a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">killing camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And that’s when we first got to know about this from the -- from the people from within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> when they met us in front of the <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Then they opened up the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> separately, and they were saying, raus, raus. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Again the same thing started with selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Right, left, right, left. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Even -- even we were all, so to speak, the cream of the crop. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">We -- we were healthy, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Still they wanted, still line up again people, and they put them off to one <span class="NPIP">end</span> , and we went to the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">They took the -- the one end away, we don’t know what happened to them, til we found out later on that they took them for gas and killing and then -- and [indecipherable] right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">With us they took us over [indecipherable] a little bit younger, they took us over and we marched towards the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And December 20, 1999 we came up to a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and there were SS men sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , there must be about 10 of them, and they had some kind of instruments 1n their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And that’s where they were tattooing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So we rolled up our sleeve and they gave us our numbers on the arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  What is your number?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  My number is A18991. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">A18991. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And they tattooed everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Next from the tattoo -- and mind you, we still didn’t get any water. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We still -- it’s already [indecipherable] three days now, no water at all, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We were tattooed, then they checked us over, they told us to go into [indecipherable] the barbers were standing, and women and men, their hair was cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Before, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> where we came from, the -- the Jewish population in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the women wore the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">They cut their own a little bit shorter, but when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they chopped all the hair off, they took off that the girls looked like boys already, everybody looked the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And that’s when they noticed, the barber, I don’t know whether he was a German, or whether he was one of the -- from the camp workers [indecipherable] but he asked me about my wound. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">The first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He asked me about my wound so I told him I had a fight inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We were pushing each other trying to get to the -- which was true, we were trying to get to that little <span class="DLF">window</span> to get a breath of <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And there was fighting, really fighting going on in December 20, 1999 that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And then -- so I told him I got hurt that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">He took -- he didn’t question me after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Shaved if off. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">It felt better after he cut away all the hair, but again it still was infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And after the haircut they told us we had to go get a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So they lined us up again and like in a <span class="DLF">maze</span> where you couldn’t get out any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">You got in, you couldn’t get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And we went in, they gave us -- they told us to leave our clothes on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and when we came out on the other end of the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , we had our striped uniforms ready with our wooden shoes and we got dressed, went back into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and we stayed there in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Finally somebody brought in some buckets of water to get -- to get drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And you could have dranked up a whole bucket yourself as thirsty we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And we -- they delivered the water and then during the night -- during the night was a terrible noise going on next <span class="DLF">door</span> to our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Very noisy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  Well, I could see -- I-I was roaming around in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I was seeing what people looked like, they -- they were already skeletons in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We were not yet skeletons, we had a little bit more food where we came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And there, the people over there, they would just look like skeletons, it scares you. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Some of them were laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , they couldn’t walk, they couldn’t talk any more, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And it’s the only thing that I saw, there was not too much to observe except the smokestack. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">You could see the smokestack coming -- the -- the -- the smoke out of the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We could see plenty of that, but the stench by that time I was already aware of what it is.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> was a little bit cleaner than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> was already like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">At least we didn’t have any <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">They did have punishment by hanging in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but not <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , no burning people in that -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna-Monowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And this man picked us up and the job that I was assigned to was to I.G.

</span><span class="sentence" id="885">And you could see always their eyes open, the sku -- front skull was always out, because they had these certain bullets, the -- the -- from the guns that they

belonged to, whether they December 20, 1999 were Germans, or Russian, or American, we didn’t know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">As we were sitting around a circle, a big <span

means. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We were hugging that guy, kissing that guy, we didn’t know what to do with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But then he jumped back up on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , I remember this time, to throw at us some rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And I remember the -- the block of candy that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">That was hardly [indecipherable] we were fighting like cats and dogs to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">So he saw he’s not going to win here. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So he stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">He says, follow me behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> and we’ll get you across to a -- to a

when we went across the <span class="DLF">road</span> with him, walked behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">We came in and then the guy had mixed up some- [’|l never forget the front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> , next to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , mixed up some big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trays</span> of whatever -- whatever they used, with potato peelings and white powder mixed up, some kind of ca -- stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So it must have been for the animals, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And we didn’t get it -- we didn’t -- couldn’t wait to go into -- inside the <span class="DLF">door</span> , we didn’t know what they going to give us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">So of course everybody was fighting over this, until the farmer came <span class="NPIP">outside</span> yelling at us, don’t eat this, this is for the pigs and the -- don’t eat this. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And he was take us away, and he told us to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Once we came in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we saw a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , people were sitting, laying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , some of them already sick from overeating. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And some of them were eating bread that I -- first time I saw a big chunk of bread like this, in my life, you know, for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And I started eating too. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I got a little bit sick too from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And then the medics came in, that’s the medics when -- when they healed my wound on the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I told him about it and he shaved it and he put a bandage on it, medicine on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I don’t remember if he gave me some pills to take, that I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">But I know he gave me some pills to take for my stomach, cause we were sick, all of us were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">He says, don’t overeat, just go slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Don’t -- don’t- don’t do too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But we were -- water [indecipherable] stop drinking for that December 20, 1999 day. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">It’s hard to describe a day like this, you know, it’s -- for the lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And we were liberated and that was it.</span></p>
