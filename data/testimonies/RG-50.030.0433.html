<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Well, during that year, until the German came in the free zone, I wouldn't say we felt completely safe, but the Germans were not there, so we, we thought, we could survive the war there. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But the Vichy(ph) government was anti-Semitic because you know they, they put, in effect, regulation that the German did ask them for. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We try, for awhile we wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Since we were we heard that the Spanish, the Jews from Spanish origin, if they cross over to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> they would not be taken back to the French, but we didn't pursue that because there were too many children, we had to go over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , so we didn't.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  So you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucien(ph</span> ) at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Yeah and we heard about the Italians protecting the Jews and so we went, we crossed <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> all over and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and there were the Italians and it was another atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there for awhile and then we move in , which was also in <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> , up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The <span class="REGION">northern Alps</span> , <span class="REGION">northern Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Oh, it was also , So we found an <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> to stay at and we went in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Let me ask you, this may seem a strange question, but do you remember any happy times with your family during all of this travel, with all of these children and...
ANSWER:  Well, the happy times were the time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucien</span> and I had my Bar Mitzvah and I had that women Raseen(ph), Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) and teaching us Zionism and Jewish history and putting actually strength in our young minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I had friends, I had many, I had many Jewish friends, because we were many Jews that were there, running away and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucien</span> was also a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We went on hikes, there was snow in the winter, we... But I remember an event that never left me, it must have been the summer 1942 when we went out of sports, playing soccer and when we finished and it was outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> a little bit, was a, a , afew guys, a few children that wanted to see how I was circumcised, had heard that in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And and they wanted to see, how does it look to have your male part circumcised and they took me by the arm, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and so forth, took off my pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And this I will never forget and never forgive them. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was part of the anti-Semite atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I wouldn't say that everybody was antagonistic toward the Jews, but many were and there was also the religious influence and the <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span> and so forth, it was really a hotbed of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">On the other hand you have the, the <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span> and the teachers, which other time, mostly came from the Socialism, Socialist background. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I wish they were more sympathetic to the Jews, but not as bad as people reared in the religion, religious, in the Catholic religion and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">A lot of people say that the French, you had the big round up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on the 16th of July, where there was a change of mind for. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Well, maybe, but as far as I'm concerned, that, the change of sentiment didn't come from the, from the, that , It really switched around six months later, first when the German lost the battle of and went into retreat in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and then, couple months later, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , that was the turn and in many people's mind, there was this possibility that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will lose the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So that's what I feel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  So tell me you're, you're in the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  At this point, in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  First we arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> , we stayed about a month in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and then we went to _._I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In the atmosphere was different because the people over there hated the Italians very much, you know, despised the Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Actually, I'd become friendly with the Italian soldiers, I remember they used to have a picnic on the, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> in a little meadow when I was coming back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and time they called me up and they were listening to the radio, English radio, BBC and they would give it to me and talk to me and friendly attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And we knew that the French to arrest anybody and... But the atmosphere was different that the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Savoire(ph</span> ) were more, I would call today rightist or, and they hated the Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So much that I'm sure that when the German came, they were glad that the German took over from the Italian.</span></p>
