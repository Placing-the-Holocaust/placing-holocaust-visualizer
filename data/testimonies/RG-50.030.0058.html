<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name 1s Isaac Danon. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">They call me Mike--my nickname. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> ,’ <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> in 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I lived there with my family, my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I have three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">One is older than me, two years older, Blanka. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And my two younger sisters, one 1s Sarah-- she is about two years younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And the youngest sister, her name is Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">She 1s about five years younger than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="11"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the Adriatic coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , about 50,000 population before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We lived there with uh there was about 200 other Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We had a rather active Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We had our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , was one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We had a social club. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I think it was called "Yarden" [Hebrew meaning "<span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> "]. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And we had our regular Zionist clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Uh, the kids were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I was going, at that time, before the war, the last year of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I went to was first <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> which was an equivalent to fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And we had a lot of friends, both Jewish and non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The, I don't remember any particular uh antisemitism being present in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Maybe some individual cases here and there, but not organized and not uh surely, not uh legal type. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Although as the things got worse in Europe, there was more activity by some groups that were sympathetic to the Nazis, but uh I belonged to some uh clubs and some organizations like uh like you would have here, Boy Scouts, but it was mostly a national organization for sports and patriotism and there was no antisemitism that I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The war came to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> in early 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We first were hit by that when my father was drafted into the service, into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They have like a general mobilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He was forty, but they took him anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And uh there was some kind of a palace coup, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The King took over the reign of the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He was a small boy, became 18, took over the government and broke relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the Axis and we knew things were going to happen then. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And sure enough about two, three weeks later, the German and Italian forces invaded our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We were very lucky that we lived in the part that has been claimed by <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> for a long, long time--<span class="REGION">Dalmatian Province</span> , or the <span class="DLF">coast</span> along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And when...of course, when they [the Italians] attacked, they took the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> over in less than two weeks; and the Italians occupied that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So that's one good thing that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">When the Italians took over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I can describe the occupation as being benign. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We as Jews had the same difficulties or same lack of problems as the rest of the local population. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There were shortages of food and other materials and rationing which you expect with a war, but otherwise we didn't fare much worse than the rest of the population, with some exceptions, let me say. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">For one thing uh Jews could not work in the public life. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They couldn't be teachers or officials of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They couldn't work in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And we, the kids, we were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But a little ingenuity solved that problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We took the Jewish teachers and we formed <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and that took care of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I unfortunately couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because my ' Also known as Spljet among some Dalmatian speakers of Serbo-Croatian, and Spalato among Italian speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">father needed me in our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We had a, I guess you could call it a <span class="BUILDING">dry goods store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Very small one uh and most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was involved in either some type of small trades or they were in some of the professions, although we did have some that were rather poor in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But anyway, uh during the Italian occupation our life was not too bad with some minor exceptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">As uh I think back, occasionally they would flood the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with some "antisemitic" slogans. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I remember some of the instances where my uncle who was a barber, they came with a big sign says, "Jews are not welcome here," and they wanted him to put it in his <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And he says, "OK, you want me to put that. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I'll put it and here are my keys and here are the scissors. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">You take over. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I'm Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, we had these little instances. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">One case that I remember and that was the worst case that happened was right after my bar mitzvah was one Saturday and the following Friday; I guess there was some kind of activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The Germans were coming to help the Italians celebrate, so they [the Italians] had to demonstrate how good they were as far as the Germans are concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So the local Fascists came to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and asked everybody to leave, and as people were leaving, they were hitting them with clubs of the uh rifles and kicking them and few little things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Although I do remember in my, some older people that were there, they would go out, then they wouldn't bother them. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But the worst thing was next morning when we came, you know, we saw what was happening, we were afraid that they might come and take us or something like that, but so we went early in the morning and we saw they had taken all the things out of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the torahs, the books and they put them in the <span class="DLF">public square</span> and they had a big bonfire. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Uh the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was 1n a section called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was the real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the type uh that, uh the word itself means, you know, where the Jewish were kept, but this was right outside the public square so most of the Jews didn't live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I mean hardly anybody, but the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was there because it was a very very old one. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh anyway, when we came, we saw that, and then we went to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and we saw somebody was trying to break in, but our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was so small we didn't even have the glass plates, so nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But they did go around and broke the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> and they looted the stuff, so that was our "Kristallnacht." </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But the following day the life went on as though nothing happened and we just didn't have a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But during the whole period before that, like more than a year that the Italians had occupied the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ...uh that portion of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we lived uh peacefully and normally except for some of these instances. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">In fact, uh a lot of immigrants--a lot of Jews that were able to escape from other parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that were occupied by Germans and "their quislings"--they also came to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And they found a haven over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Uh as I mentioned earlier, there was about two hundred uh Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Well, after a few months the number swelled to four or five thousand, and then maybe up to ten thousand people that came from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and at that point the Italians started getting panicky. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The Italian authorities, they asked the Jewish community to disperse them throughout the <span class="REGION">area</span> that they [the Italians] controlled, and then finally they started taking them away to, I guess we can call them internment centers. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Both, different <span class="REGION">areas</span> along the <span class="REGION">occupied coast</span> and also in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh I didn't think of this too much, but Italians were really, uh what shall I say, they helped many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They saved us for one thing, and they and many times when the Germans were, their quislings, the Croatians, they wanted to occupy certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> or they wanted to take certain Jews away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , the Italians would step in and say, "This 1s our <span class="REGION">area</span> and you can't cross." </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And it was, for them it was, you know, a territorial issue which for us it was a case of life or death. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But our problems really started after the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That's when uh Mussolini fell, of course, and the Italians uh signed a, I guess uh - what is it - they capitulated to the Allied troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Well, in these <span class="REGION">areas</span> that were occupied by Italians became like uh free areas and it was free-for-all, who was going to grab what. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The Partisans” came out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and they took over some. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The, the Croatian quislings took some over. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The Germans took some, but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived was taken over by the Partisans, uh the underground resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They came out and I guess they compromised themselves, the local population who helped them and who didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I found out that my older sister, she had been working in the underground which we didn't know about even though my sister and I were quite close. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But at that time she was uh less than sixteen years old and but there was things to do for everybody during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Anyway, uh my sister at that point joined the Partisans and so did many uh local youths. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They, the Partisans were trying to get them to join them and go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh I would say a lot of them did join, but we remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the Partisans tried to hold that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They had taken, they had uh disarmed the Italian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They had some, some arms now, and the new recruits that had joined them, so they were going to defend the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and they tried that for two, three weeks, but the German troops just came over with their full armor and everything and they took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but not before they came in, we were, we [a]wakened in the middle of the night by neighbors banging at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and saying - I remember one lady yelling, "Mr. Danon, Mr. Danon," to my father--he was the mister--anyway, "Mr. Danon, the Germans are coming." </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So we knew that the Germans always take the men first and we were ready to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My father and I, we had our backpacks all packed in advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We put them on, said goodbye to my mother and my sisters and we went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That's the last time we saw our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And uh we joined the Partisans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">At first not as fighters, but we just traveled with them and did what ever could be done and we traveled with them for a couple of months through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">This was, you, you hide during the daytime and you tippy- toe at night crossing <span class="DLF">German lines</span> maybe several times, you know, going from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another until we arrived to one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> uh on the <span class="DLF">coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Actually, what people were doing, they were going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and they would come to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> and they would uh maybe there would be a little uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> or a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">junk</span> and in the middle of the night they would go aboard one of these and go to the, one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Only the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> weren't safe because Germans could always come over there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Now we went to one of these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and we were with the Partisans there and my father and I were, I guess I won't call it conscriptive--we were regular military unit at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Uh, I was assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> where we repaired ammunition and other equipment, automotive and what not, and my father was uh, I remember they called this the, the duty that they assigned to him--"ekonom," which, uh, meant supply sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And uh we were there for four, five months, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Time just, it's not too clearly in my mind right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  What <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> was that? * </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Communist resistance forces led by Joseph Broz Tito.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> 's called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hvar</span> , H - V - A-R. I can't pronounce 1's too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh and it's a relatively large <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It had two little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and the one where we were in was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starigrad</span> , which means old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Uh, anyway one time the Germans did invade that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and there was fear because there was not too much in the way of defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Uh, and this was in the middle of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The Allies were uh stuck down <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Uh, there was, uh I guess we all read about the Monte Cassino’ or wherever they were, they couldn't move forward and uh there was nothing happening anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Even the Russians, the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> had stalemated, been stalemated for a while, so this was middle of the war and it could have gone either way and we were pretty fearful at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Well, anyway, my father and I guess he wasn't having a very easy time of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh, first the work was hard for him and and there wasn't enough food and the people who depended on him to obtain food, like supply sergeant meant getting flour and making sure the bread was made and uh you know other food uh was provided and clothing and what not--they were always complaining and uh they were blaming him for all the shortages and so I remember uh he somehow disappeared or--I didn't see him for several days and they kept pestering me, uh you know--"Where is your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">What happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="118">This and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I guess my father had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He had uh gone some other route. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But two weeks later I received a very official uh teletype telling me to report to another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and report myself to the command of the hospital unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I had no idea what that was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Well, I made arrangements to go there, and this was another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vis</span> , V - I - S. And this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> was uh formed into a strong point by the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It was the furtherest [farthest] <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> from <span class="DLF">Yugoslavian coast</span> and closest to <span class="DLF">Italian coast</span> , closest to the point where the Allied troops were. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So this was used by the Allied troops to help the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">At this point, if I can introduce a little politics here, uh the Allies had started recognizing the Partisans as the fighting force as opposed to other, there was a fellow by the name of Dra_a Mihailovi_,* who was left by the King uh to, I guess, to organize resistance, but he evidently didn't do the job that they expected, or maybe there were political differences and the Partisans were communist-oriented and the other ones were uh for monarchy and so there was a lot of internal struggle, but let me get away from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But uh anyway the Allies had started recognizing and helping the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So, this uh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> was made into a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They used that to bring the supplies and also there was another point that the Allies were trying to convey a message to the Germans that they were going to open a new front, a second front, at the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> and come through there, so they were encouraging the local population to escape, and the local population had developed like an underground railroad you can almost call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They would get themselves to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> and from the <span class="DLF">coastline</span> they would come by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">junks</span> to these, to this particular <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and the uh British Navy would come and pick them up there and take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , where they had like * <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monte Cassino</span> was the strong point of a <span class="DLF">German defensive line</span> that delayed the Allied advance on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> until June 1944. * </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Dragoljub (Dra_a) Mihailovi_ (also Mihajlovi_) was the leader of the _etniks, an anticommunist Serbian resistance force loyal to the royal Yugoslav government-in-exile. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I would call it regroupment points. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They would create uh units of uh refugees, I guess by location, and take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , to the <span class="DLF">desert</span> to wait for the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Well, uh when I came, I gotta go back now to my tele... telegram that I received. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">When I presented myself there, that actually my father had sent it to get me to come there and I met him there again and he told me that he has, he had joined this group that was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and he was going to go with the troops and he told me to sign up for it also at the first opportunity and we'll meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I did that and I know he went one time and uh the first opportunity that I had when the British uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> came--uh, they were small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">PT boats</span> or something that would pick up thirty, forty people, uh you know, pile us up and go across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span> and we went uh over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I went there with the British to a...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , B - A - R - I. There was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , where all the refugees were coming but from there they would ship us by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , mostly <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and further [farther] down south, southern tip of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where there were a lot of uh <span class="BUILDING">summer homes</span> from the rich northern Italian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">This was in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So they would organize these groups and from there they would take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Well, anyway, that's where I, I was taken and I met my father there again and we were in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> uh, waiting for our shipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">While we were there, uh there were many people incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">By the thousands they were coming from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">While we were there, we learned that my mother's two sisters were also there in the vicinity and my mother's brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> uh, with his family, so we had some family that was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Uh, if, if 1 can go back a little bit, uh--this was about my family, my parent's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">My parents' family, both of them came from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Well, my mother's parents came in the early '90's. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> which was our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , and they settled there and they had uh whatever they did-I don't remember now--but as I remember my grandfather, he was the "shamas" [sexton] at our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">That was his occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But as the children grew up they got married and some went to different <span class="NPIP">locations</span> , and one of my, two of my mother's sisters went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Uh so when the war broke out, they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So one of them was able to come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> and stay with the rest of the family, and they were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The other one perished in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">On my father's side, he had his parents and five brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They were also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> but some of them lived right outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and and none of them were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They all perished with one exception, my Uncle David, my father's brother who was in the [Yugoslav] Army during the mobilization and the Germans captured them and they shipped them someplace wherever they had their Army prisoners and I guess he passed as a non-Jew and that's how when the war ended when some of them were repatriated, he was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So when we were talking about who was able to be saved and who wasn't, my father counted twenty-eight of his relatives that died. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Relatives meaning mother, father, brothers, sister-in-laws [sic] and their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So but anyway, back to where we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We lived there uh for a couple of weeks and then when it was time to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> my father got cold feet and he says I'm not going to the <span class="DLF">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So in the morning when they were gathering us all to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , my father got me out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and we left the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We booked, uh took a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> from a local uh farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He took us to the nearest <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , we boarded the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where he dropped us off. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lecci</span> [Lecce], L - E- C- C - I [E], in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It's near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> but maybe about fifteen miles or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Anyway, and that's where we settled and my father got a job there with the Allied occupation forces as a uh censor, uh read the mail, and I was just hanging around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I had, uh don't forget I was thirteen years old there and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I had a uniform that I brought with me which was an American or British soldier's uniform, like an Eisenhower jacket, a military thing you know and I would parade there with my friends enjoying life, you know, uh, uh as a thirteen year old would, uh showing off my clothes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Well anyway uh there was very uneventful at the time and then, this was June '44, the end of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Uh, they [the Western Allies] already had, they opened a new front in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> ” and all that and we heard that there was an invitation from the American government for a thousand people, a thousand displaced persons to come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and uh OK, we said, "Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Shall we go, yeah." </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We signed up and this was quick like you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They took our names. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I understand there was a lot of people who signed up but only a thousand could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Uh we didn't know for sure whether it was just Jewish or not, but anyway we signed up and we were getting ready to go and three days before we were ready to leave, we learned that my mother and two sisters had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Now this is a story in itself the way the refugees would uh--it's almost like uh <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You would go into the group and you say, "Is anybody here from such and such a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And they say, "No, we are not, but we know somebody who is," you know, and we know so and so and oh yeah, but he knows somebody who knows somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And that's how we all met you know, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And that's how my mother when she came with one of the groups uh, you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British naval vessel</span> , and they told her that we know somebody who is also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> who may be related to you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And they said, "Well, his name is so and so," and he says, "That's my brother," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So we all, we got together and within the next three days the miracle of bureaucracy--they were able to clear my mother and my two sisters and we, uh we were picked up at one point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> and we boarded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , uh different people are coming from different parts of <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> uh in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Well, we stopped off for three days for delousing sessions and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , uh I forgot its name, uh Henry something or other, but it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was taking the American soldiers back and it was one of the regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ships</span> and we were given one little corner with uh, uh, what do you call these <span class="INT_SPACE">sleeping quarters</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hammocks</span> , yeah, five deep, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And uh we waited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> for enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> so they can form a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> ; and we departed from there near the end of July. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Thirteen days uh on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Several times they thought they saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German U- boats</span> , and they went through the routine of putting that fog, artificial fog. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We as kids, we enjoyed all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I was fourteen by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">On August 3rd, 1944, we landed in New York Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I believe it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bayonne</span> or some <span class="NPIP">place</span> , wherever the troop shipments were uh being unloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And we got into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> there and we went overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="194"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> stopped in front of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We got out; and this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upstate New York</span> , near a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">This was an old <span class="BUILDING">Army base</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And that's where we spent next year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Uh I can tell you about our life over there, if you want to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Well, uh first, uh well, this was summer time of course, August then. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">In September was when the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We were invited to join the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">None of us knew any English at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I speak a few foreign languages but English ° Anglo-American-Canadian forces landed on the Normandy Peninsula of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on June 6, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">was not one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But anyway we started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and our, our parents were uh just staying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">What bothered us mostly was the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We were not allowed to go out except to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We had little passes and we had to return, sign in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">That was a little disappointing. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But basically that's uh what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And we spent there until the war was over actually, and then I guess there was a lot of discussion whether we should go back or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Uh we had signed that we, before we came we had signed uh what kind of agreement with the American government that we were going to stay there for the duration of the war, and then go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And uh, when the war was over I guess we were being asked whether we wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Some people did go immediately because they left their, part of their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">But uh many of us, most of us, wanted to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So there was a lot of politicking and this is another story altogether and this was documented in this uh book that uh was written, let's see, the book is called "Haven," "The Haven," and it was written by Ruth Gruber.</span><span class="sentence" id="217">° She was closely involved in that so she would know more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Can you--was your father involved in the politicking at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  No, my father was, uh actually what happened to my father - he was demoralized at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Uh he had this little business that he ran in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> during the war and uh he, when we left, he knew that everything was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">All the lifetime's work. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And his family was all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And he just gave up on everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So even when we came out, uh after we were allowed to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">He didn't work or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was uh, he was psychologically drained. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I wanted to mention something else about my sisters and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">After my father and I had left, we didn't know what has happened or how they were going to manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">All we knew is that Germans usually take the men first and women hopefully uh later or whatever, but anyway we were hoping that things could work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Well, my sisters and my mother told me later their story and maybe I can bring out some of those points. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Uh, my mother was in a panic and had these two younger sisters as I mentioned: my next younger sister, Sarah, she was nine year old and then this was the youngest one, Esther, six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And I understand that my nine-year old sister was the hero of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">She led everybody along. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She says, "OK, this is not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It's not safe here. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Let's go into hiding." </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And she forced my mother to make arrangements to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">First they stayed wherever our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Then somebody else took them in, similar to the story of Anne Frank, while the Germans were around, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They were still hiding and they would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and see what was happening, and uh that wasn't too safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Uh then they talked to a person who had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> like a--this was lots of vineyards in that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They had a big uh vineyard, maybe about thirty, forty miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so they had friends who had friends and they took them to this <span class="DLF">farm</span> which is, you know, you're away from civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Nobody comes there. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So they were safe there for a while and my mother had some money that uh we were able to save up and I remember when my father and I left, they split up the money, hopefully uh in case either <span class="NPIP">side</span> ° Ruth Gruber, Haven: The Unknown Story of 1,000 World War II Refugees (New York: Coward-McCann, 1983). </span><span class="sentence" id="246">needed you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So uh my mother was paying them whatever, and then after a while these people were also afraid, so they wouldn't keep my parents any more so my sister, she took my other sister by one hand and my mother by another, and they went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and they traveled on foot without shoes, you know--that's the kind of stuff--through, well there were no <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Even today <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> doesn't have any <span class="DLF">roads</span> to speak of, but you know, you go through the <span class="DLF">donkey trails</span> and uh they ended up the same way that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The same <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , only nine months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">That's my mother and my two younger sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">My older sister, she, after the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , she joined the Partisan fighting unit and she was uh she's, right now she is 4'10" in high heels (laughter), so she's a little girl but anyway she was there carrying her load and uh she tells a story about how they would attack from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and they went around the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and attacked the Germans from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to give the impression that there was more of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And she got wounded in the leg and she still has problems with that leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Uh I, occasionally I would ask her stories about uh the war, you know, and they had all these what they called German offensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">First offensive, second offensive, sixth offensive, and she was in all of them as a fighting Partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They had both men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">There was no distinction at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Incidentally this sister of mine, her name is Blanka, she never came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">She stayed there, but I guess she had a pretty pleasant life after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The first wasn't so, and then she got married and they traveled throughout the world and she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> and uh, uh some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> --I just couldn't keep track of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">She studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and she's been to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">She comes here every other year, so she didn't have such a bad life after that, but anyway .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit more about your life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">What the kind of restrictions were like? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Uh, what your daily life was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Oh, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , that was when we first came, we were a bunch of, oh what should I say, proud kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We were not going to let anybody give us the impression that we are poor and uh we needed help from anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">See, it was little thing psychologically that when we came here, we were greeted, welcomed and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But Americans are the most generous people in the world is beyond question. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But they are also naive, so they would ask us questions like uh, "You see this--this is bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Did you ever eat this before?" </span><span class="sentence" id="273">You know kind of thing--I mean it's mind-boggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And that puts us on the defensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So we would say, "Oh, sure, we had it good on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ," and uh we were a little bit--what should I say--snotty kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Anyway so we had this <span class="DLF">fence</span> that prevented us from going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and that bothered us a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">There was uh ample opportunity for sports and uh food uh like we hadn't seen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I mean quantities, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We were just coming from the hungry Europe, so life was pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Was it run by the American military?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Uh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">What they did--this was put under what they called War Relocation Authority.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They ’ The War Relocation Authority was charged with administering <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> under the overrall created a unit called Emergency Refugee Shelter under the War Relocation Authority which was part of the Department of the Interior. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">This is the very same group that interned the Japanese during the war, if you are familiar with that story.</span><span class="sentence" id="286">® Well, anyway, they were in charge of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The, the military brought us over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but then it was handed over to the War Relocation Authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And they had a civilian administrator that was appointed by this unit, uh by the Authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Uh, it was a very democratically-run organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">One thing they did teach us was democracy at its best. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">You know, we elected representatives and we were voting on everything from uh what kind of menu we were going to have to uh who was going to do what, uh, we even were required to take jobs, you know, the grown-ups, not--the kids went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">That, that was a well-organized uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of one thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh...
QUESTION:  What were the living conditions like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  The living conditions were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> which were boarded up to fit family units. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">In other words, they would take one large <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and sub it into maybe three or four units. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">For instance, there was five of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">My mother, father and myself and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And we were given two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and uh they had sink, one sink. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You know they had put in some plumbing in there and uh we uh had no problems with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">The only thing that bothered some of us was the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It would pile up ten ten feet high, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I had come from <span class="REGION">Adriatic coast</span> which even in winter it's a very mild climate, and here this was snow covers the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> the end of September and you don't see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> until late April or early May. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So, this was uh a little bit different for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">But I looked back on those two years that we spent there, uh a year and a half, as some of the very pleasant part of my youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Uh in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we, most of us excelled because we were really used to uh stringent demands on our academic performance, and we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> here and the only, the only difficulty that we had was learning the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Well you learned the language under total immersion in six weeks, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So we were doing pretty good and we made friends with some local people. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Not too much because simply we were not allowed to go in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We just go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And later they would give us passes; Saturday afternoon we could go to a local movie, but heck, they had movies <span class="NPIP">inside</span> for us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Only, maybe not first-run movies but there was something going on every night recreation-wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It was really a pleasant life all around. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  Did it turn out that most of the people there were Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="314">direction of the War Refugee Board, which was established by executive order on January 22, 1944 and active in transferring refugees from <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> to camps in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> and to a so-called "free port" at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . *</span><span class="sentence" id="315">In early 1942 more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans living along the <span class="REGION">West Coast</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> 1n the interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There was, out of a thousand people when after all was said and done, some dropped out so there was about nine hundred and ninety-two people,’ I would say nine hundred and fifty were Jewish and the thirty or so, forty were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But we had people from I forget how many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , seventy <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They were from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Oh, that was an interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">You want to make an announcement like they would say there's going to be a movie tonight - and they would come and you have to say it first in German, because I guess German was the most widely understood language. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And Serbo-Croatian is the language of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And there was about three hundred people from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And logically so, because they, the route that people came, but uh, let's see, they, uh they were not too powerful I guess in our politicking within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp but</span> there was Italian was spoken because we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Yiddish was a very prominent language. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Serbo-Croatian. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Uh there were a lot of Polish people that had left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , you know, through their uh water route from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And they spoke French and Polish and Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And uh it was like a United Nations walking on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> there, except for the kids who spoke English, and we tried not to speak our own languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Anyway, that's, in a nutshell. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  .. the Jewish life was there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Oh, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we had uh Jewish life of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">There were uh two <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Like anything else, you have two Jews; you have three different opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And we had one conservative and the other one was ultra-orthodox and uh we had uh services, regular services and we had a uh choir. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I am pretty observant, I would say, and my family was, and uh I guess many people were not, so you knew there were always services at the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox "Shul</span> " [<span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But ours was strictly Friday night or Saturday morning and it was a <span class="BUILDING">military chapel</span> and uh the way the <span class="DLF">chapel doors</span> were made they had crosses on them, so some people objected to worshiping there because they didn't feel comfortable with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So they started their own, you know, internal, but 1t was, Jewish life was not restricted or not promoted any more than anywhere else, but we had, Jewish uh papers were coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and uh I would say in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the life was absolutely, uh was not only congenial but it was conducive to uh culture, uh cultural development and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Educational programs galore, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Recreation. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It just uh, it was fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Uh for some people who were professionals this was a delay in their advancement, but for me I was moving right along. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I had finished fifth grade in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and during the war like three years I hadn't gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so five grades you don't retain very high education. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So they put me here in seventh grade, and not only all that period that transpired that I didn't do anything academically but also I was with uh older people, so six months I was moved to eighth grade and in the next six months I was in the ninth grade and so I was getting what they called high honors and uh we were all pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I wasn't the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I mean there was, my friends, each one was competing who was going to do better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  We have just a few minutes left. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Uh, is there anything specific that you remember, any ” The official number was 982, 368 of whom were from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">incident from your time with the Partisans uh that you would like to share, or anything else that you have not yet talked about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  You know, let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There could be a few points. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">First of all, I--as we were talking earlier, I tried to remember--there there were some people who were uh compassionate and who were good and helpful and did something for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">For one thing, the neighbors who came in the middle of the night, knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and told us about the Germans coming; how they knew it I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I think they were connected uh with the local Nazi groups in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Uh the neighbors above us, they were strictly Nazis from way back, but anyway, these other people, they must have learned from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They told us so, that may have saved our lives, my father's and mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Also the Italian uh people whoever they were at the time, like if it weren't for them, I mean all these Jews who came from other parts of Europe that were saved, if 1t weren't for them I don't know how many more would have perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Uh but there was an interesting episode uh during the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Uh, my father, I told you, he wasn't handling it too well; the work was hard and all that, but he had a bad experience uh one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Uh, he's religious and every morning he would say his prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Well, uh he would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where we were living and do it, say it out loud, his prayer, and he would cover his head with a kerchief, and he would put it around his ears to hold the kerchief like this, and a farmer must have seen him, and he reported [him] to the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Now to put it in the perspective, there was a lot of problems with uh people uh, I mean the Partisans were never safe because somebody would report them to the Germans and they would come and, you know, the, the spies were all over, so this peasant thought that he was uncovering somebody that was talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">He looked at my father and he noticed the ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">There was a a hanky over his head, so he reported him and they came and took my father away, and this was a <span class="BUILDING">kangaroo court</span> kind of thing, and uh they say, "OK, admit that you were talking on the earphones and reporting to Nazis." </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He said, "I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">What do I need to tell them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And they said, "Comrade Danon, we know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We know it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It's been told to us so you can't hide it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Admit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It will be easier on you." </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And this is the thing that broke the camel's back I guess, the straw that broke the camel's back, but there were incidents like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Uh a few of them you know, and that's why he left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  He just ran away at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Sort of, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Can you tell me anything about how the Jewish community coped with all these refugees coming in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, that was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Uh, the, all these refugees that were coming in--at first they were on their own, but then later many of them just had no means of uh support, I think the international uh Jewish uh community stepped in, and I think it's B'nai B'rith was one of the groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Another one was uh Societé Israélite Mondiale--something like that--from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They were uh sending uh some money to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> to distribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Third way was that the people who were coming in, they were, we, our family was assigned two different families that would come and get their lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Uh, one family would come three times a week, and another one would come three other days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You know, in other words we would cook instead of for five people or six people, we would cook for eleven people. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And uh that's how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">That's how some sustained themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Others had some, uh something that they had brought with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Some had some gold coins and there would be a lot of trading and and some would go into some kind of business, uh business meaning that they would go to one <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and say, "What are you selling? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Maybe you give me some samples," and they would go offer to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I know one guy was uh taking peanuts and roasting them and making little bags and selling them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And it was a meager existence, but they managed and of course this little support that they would get every two weeks and I remember there was once or twice that the money didn't come from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , so we, the locals, were asked to make a heavy contribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Uh what 1s heavy, I don't know the numbers, but you know, enough so we can make the distribution at least until something comes from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  Where did these people live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  Uh, that's the thing--some had families but uh after a while, you know, there's just no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and uh where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was, there was some--not <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I'm sorry--where our club was uh the social club was, the social club was filled with uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and uh blankets and they slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and I guess they would rent a <span class="DLF">farm</span> someplace and they would fill thirty, forty people in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  You're welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I enjoyed talking to you. </span>
