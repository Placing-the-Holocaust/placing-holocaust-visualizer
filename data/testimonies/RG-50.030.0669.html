<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  I will start with my grandfather, my father's father, who started out as a Jewish peddler with atray around his neck selling stuff from it, and he walked from what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and established an export/import business and got very rich and very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Fortunately, he died before the Nazis could take away all his money and his <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And it was really his money that provided my parents with the money to -- they were school people. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They always had <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And they got the money from my grandfather to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My mother was one of the very early physicians and became a psychoanalyst. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">She studied with Dr. Freud, and he became friends of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I remember that his daughter, Anna Freud, was also a psychoanalyst, used to come and visit frequently and was aclose friend of my mother -- of my mother's. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So that that's how -- then my father had a PhD in Art History, and they decided to go into education. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They believed in what was then a very novel idea and progressive idea that they would have a co-educational boarding school. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And as the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> grew, they moved from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> tothe other until they finally ended up in aplace called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mariendahl</span> (ph), which was a large <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , became a large <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there with about 200 students, and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> still exists in --
QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gunderstein</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No, this is in -- it's also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , but it's a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gunderstein</span> was the second <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they had, and then Mariendahl was the third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">After that, of course, the Nazis came in 1933, and my parents were both Jewish, so it was clear that this wasn't going to last very long, and for awhile the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> continued because we had the Nazi minister of education's daughter in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  So that --

<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Her father's name was Kerrl, K-E-R-R-L. I don't remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was about 10 or 12 at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And then my mother decided that the Nazis were going to be there for along time. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Well, my father thought they were just a passing problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we prepared to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And what is all this growling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I want to interrupt just for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">No, no, no, it's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You can keep the taping going. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Just to say that if there's audio onthe tape it has some growling. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We have too lovely poodles who are guarding Mr. Bondy, and we have achoice of whether or not they are inthe <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and bark, or whether they're here and just have a low-level growl. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So for ambient audio noise, we have preferred the latter choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So just to give future people who, you know, future listeners, an idea of why the growling is there; it's friendly growling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Can we back up just a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Iwas a passionate soccer player, and I remember playing soccer in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And once the Nazis came in, they decided that Jewish kids couldn't play soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So my earliest, earliest memory is not being allowed to play soccer anymore, which was a great blow to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">For any boy, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  {Laughter}

<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  That's young, but would it -- young for the question I'm going to ask, but do you remember your parents having discussions about the Nazis coming to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  What was the tone of those discussions? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Did they talk amongst themselves or did they talk to you about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Well, they explained antisemitism, which was a very strange concept to me, partly because I'd been brought up without any religion and didn't really realize that I was Jewish until I was probably ten years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They talked about the danger of the Nazis and that they might have to do something about it, leave, or -- and they -- my mother was a psychoanalyst, so they believed in talking to children very openly, and so we pretty much knew by age 10 what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Do you remember how your sisters reacted? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Did you talk amongst the siblings about this?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  So she was a teenager.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  And she was much more conscious when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of leaving her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and leaving her, and she had about the time she was 18, she was engaged toa young man who came with us to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> later on, and she started a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> also, so --
QUESTION:  What were the other kids in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like when the Nazis came to power? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Did you feel that inthe <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they were anti-Nazi and very protective of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I don't think -- at least that's along time ago --I don't think any of them turned out to be Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I know that one or two joined the SA in order to protect the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but we didn't really run into Nazis until probably 1935 when the State started appointing teachers to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they were of course Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  You said this was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Yes, it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And it was largely funded by the money your grandfather had earned?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And you said he died before his --
ANSWER:  He died before -- I think he died in 1933, which was just the beginning of the Nazi time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they did not -- any Jewish push did not start until one or two years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Let's back up a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I didn't realize you knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What kind of relationship did you have with your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He died when I was nine or 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I knew he had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , as we visited occasionally, and my mother's mother -- my original grandfather was blind and died early.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Your maternal grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  My maternal grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">She remarried and eventually died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , both she and her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Your grandparents, Your step-grandfather and your grandmother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  And my grandmother, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I had -- it was amazing, I had two cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He was a chemist, and she was a social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> for six years, and he survived because he was in charge of delousing, and she survived because she took care of one of her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But they told these stories; it always amazed me that every morning she would knock on his <span class="DLF">window</span> to let him know that she was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And they came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and had avery successful life here. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He came -- he worked for, I forgot what company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburg</span> , a chemical company, and did very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dupont</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I didn't hear you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dupont</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dupont</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  No, it wasn’t three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We went at different times across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The Swiss were very anxious in those days about letting too many Jews into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  So they had inherited money, but did they have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of their own? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Did they have a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  All that was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We had some friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> who helped in the beginning until the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> got started, but we had almost no money at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was there discussion of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  There was several reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">One is that the Swiss were very dubious about having Germans, and they were sending people back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Secondly, our visa had run out, and we were actually very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">In those days if you were Jewish you had a"J" in your German passport, and American immigration laws in those days meant that if you were Jewish it took three or four more years before you could get, while they were perfectly happy to take non-Jewish Germans, and we had a friend at the <span class="BUILDING">German Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> who made sure that we had passports without a "J" init, which gave us an early immigration visa to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Isee. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So for all those reasons -- so that when you left, do you remember leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  How did you leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  We went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> -- I believe it was ?</span><span class="sentence" id="286">La Sauve? </span><span class="sentence" id="287">to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Did you speak French at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  I spoke pretty good French then because I'd lived inthe French part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  And who was on this trip? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Was it just your parents and sisters at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  There were two other former students who came with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  And your sister's fiancé?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  And my -- he had already -- he was non-Jewish, and he was able to get a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , so he was already in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> by the time we got here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  Going back to when you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then also in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had non-Jewish kids in it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Of course, I was very young, but, as I said, I played soccer alot, and we played other teams from other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and people came in from the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">There was no prejudice against Jews atthe time. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">If there was, it was not apparent, and so we had alot of Germans who would --

<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I think was too young to really feel German. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">My sister, my oldest sister felt very much that she had lost her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I didn't really. [</span><span class="sentence" id="311">never felt particularly German, and having learned French in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and so I actually all my life I haven't felt particularly German?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Well, Imean, the value of having another language in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is the kids never understand what you're saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And sometimes that's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Where did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Where did you arrive, and where did you settle and why?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  They had various friends, and one of them was a writer named Dorothy Canfield Fisher, who was quite a famous writer at the time, and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> , <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> , and said there was this <span class="NPIP">place</span> that would be very good forthe <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So we moved to -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> then eventually moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> , and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lenox</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lenox</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="349">That's quite a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I mean, it's quite a change from city life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to, I assume, town life in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  We, I guess, were never really invested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and plans were always to move out back into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so --

<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Well, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">local high school</span> because our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wasn't working yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Windsor Mountain School</span> for my last two years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Ihad a scholarship at a place called <span class="BUILDING">Wagner College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staten Island</span> , but after three months, because I was a German National, they asked me to leave, and through various friends, and because I was a great soccer player, I got accepted at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> , and | stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> for four years and graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Very hard to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I think I was most worried about learning the language and learning to fit in. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It wasn't that difficult because when the <span class="BUILDING">Windsor Mountain School</span> started, there were only about eight students. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It later became much larger, so that we all had sort of a ready-made --
QUESTION:  But before then you were inthis <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which wasn't successful for you.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Was it strict?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  It was strict, and I didn't think we were learning anything in the classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And, of course, by the time I was 15 or 16, I'd been through a fair amount of changes in my life, so that I was probably more conscious of the world around me than the people my age there, and that kind of bothered me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  Could be very lonely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  I was lonely, because I didn't speak English very well.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  They had, for instance?Tomus Mun? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">was a friend of theirs, and various other writers. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">One of the first students was the daughter of Karl ?</span><span class="sentence" id="388">Sutmeyer? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">who was a German writer, and there was awhole group of German and American intellectuals who supported the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they helped us get going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Well, it's unusual in many ways because most people who came inthe <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> didn't have such acircle, and it suggests that -- I don't mean the term in any negative way -- but anelite kind of social circle thathad come from Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  It certainly was easier for us than for many other German refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I don't -- you were probably not alive in those days, but there was avery strong antisemetic strain in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  And it really is a big change inthis <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from the antisemitism that existed at that time to the pretty much total acceptance that exists now.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  No, it was gradual. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And, to be honest with you, I never felt particularly Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">The only reason that I would tell people that Iwas Jewish is that I felt to explain what the Germans did and that I wasn't ashamed of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But most of my life nobody asked, and I was always blond and not particularly looking of any kind of -- so that 1t never -- in many years it was never mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I mean, and the fact that we were not religious, of course, made abig difference.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  Iwas 18, and I loved skiing, and somebody told me if you join the mountain troops you'll do alot of skiing. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So I volunteered for the mountain troops, which were in a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camphill</span> , <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> , and I spent about eight months there until I was transferred. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I suddenly got orders to transfer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  So it was cold and not well heated, not efficiently heated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> atthe end that spewed out, was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood stove</span> , and was not very warm inthe <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and we never did any skiing. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We hiked a lot with backpacks, and I was very glad to get out of there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  What I remember from my reading of the US military forces in World War II is that before it had been much more ofa professional army, and World War II brought in civilians, and in many ways was a great leveler, or people from totally different backgrounds were thrown together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  That's correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  Did you experience that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">When I first went to the mountain troops, for instance, most of the people were college guys who, people who had started <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , wood skiers, and volunteers, and then they didn't get enough people. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And they started send draftees, for instance, from <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> and various other <span class="REGION">southern states</span> who were absolutely totally miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I can remember that this one guy, he was a sharp shooter and was very proud of it, but it was socold that you had to wear gloves, and he refused to wear gloves, and his hands kept freezing to the trigger, and we tried to explain it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But eventually he went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because he had, was just one of those --
QUESTION:  It's a detail, but it ends up being very crucial for somebody who was a sharp shooter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And he couldn't do it without gloves, and he didn't feel he could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Were you the only one who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mountain camp</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Did you guys talk much about with one another? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Did you get to know one another very well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Oh, we got to know each other, but at that time I spoke perfect English. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And in those days the Army didn't want any noncitizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Were you a citizen by that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  No, I became a citizen of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leadville</span> , <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> , which was right near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And I was -- I guess I was 18 or 19 when I became a citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  Did it mean something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  Did it mean something when that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  I'd been living inthe <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for a while, and being inthe Army, it was nice to be acitizen, but it wasn't a terribly big thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  And now you say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It sounds like that transfer sort of fell from the <span class="DLF">sky</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Yes, it did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  So someone in the Army must have known your background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Somebody found out I'm sure, and there were -- when I talked to the people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritchie</span> , there were alot of people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">SoIwas younger than most because many of the German emigrees were older when they came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They also were suddenly called out. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Somebody in their service records found that they spoke German or French, and so we got transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritchie</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  So now where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritchie</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Tell us what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritchie</span> was, where it was.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  Well, if you could walk me through a few, some of the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Do you remember what it was like when you got there? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Who you first talked to, some of the officials, how they put in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> rather than another <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I don't really remember much of that.</span></p>

QUESTION: <span class="REGION"> Colorado</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER: <span class="REGION"> Colorado</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And it was strange because people either spoke French or German or Japanese, and there was relatively rigorous training in how to interrogate people, what not todo, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">In the three years that I interrogated people, I never touched a German prisoner, even when I interrogated a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard that you wanted to rip apart with your hands, we never touched them, and I don't think any of the other interrogators ever touched German prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  So that was something that you learned very early on? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">That was one of the rules?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Absolute rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Don't touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">You can play whatever intellectual trick you want to play on them to make them talk, but you can't touch them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  Can you remember anything else about that training, how to become an interrogator, a prisoner of war interrogator?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  There are two things: You had to learn the makeup of the German army, what divisions, who was commander, what division, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And they were very strict about not torturing anybody ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Ican show you a picture of --

<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Now, when you -- okay, so the training lasted how long?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  I thought that I was going to be able to do more --I felt very strongly, having come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that it was all -- our views were passivists, that I couldn't let other people do it for me because it didn't, didn't seem right at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So, as I said, I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Once we were finished with Ritchey, we were assigned to various divisions as a team. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I was inthe 79th Division and stayed with the 79th Division all the way through Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">You can see where we went somewhere here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Oh, we were very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">The idea was that German prisoners would talk best if you talked to them within ten minutes of their capture 'cause they were psychologically still traumatized. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So we were very close to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> always, and we started right away interrogating prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  So you didn't face combat? </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Even though you were close to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , you weren't involved in combat?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Oh, my goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  Sol don't remember them too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Ican remember that if somebody didn't want to tell me what I wanted to know, I would say, well, see that solider at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He's from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He just lost his parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Would you rather talk to him or to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And they usually would rather talk to me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER: T have to admit that I had pretty strong feelings about the Germans, and particularly ranking officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I remember probably -- there was nobody who was really exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">There was one general who knew the division commander of the division I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They had somehow gotten together, and he was very upset by the fact that I treated him like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And the general came down to say hello to him, but we didn't treat him any better than anybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  What can you tell us about those interrogations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  About what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  About the interrogations, about -- you mentioned that your own feelings were pretty strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  Well, where I was, the information we were looking for was usually pretty simple, like, what division are you from, what orders did you have to attack, where were you supposed to attack, how many people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I mean, they were all very direct questions connected to the tactical situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  Military questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  Military questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Do you remember the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you had your first interrogation? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Was it in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  Yeah, did you meet any soldiers your own age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  German soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">The Germans by that time had lost alot of people onthe <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , and they were drafting 17, 16, sometimes 15 year olds into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So there were alot of people younger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">One of the things that we did as an interpreter -- as an interrogator, we were very conscious that the Germans were rank conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And I was allowed to wear any kind of button up to Major, which on an 18-year-old was a little iffy, of course, and we finally settled in the end of wearing US buttons that just said US on the shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It did allow me to go eat in the officers' mess occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  But you say it was because the Germans were rank conscious that you were allowed to wear these buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Did that mean that -- did that mean that in the interrogation situation somebody who would have been higher ranking than you sees this button and then is more likely --
ANSWER:  More likely to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">The US button sort of represented some kind of a special troops to the Germans so that -- but there were Germans when I first started, and it was acorporal who said they wouldn't talk to a corporal; get me a lieutenant; I will talk to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Did they know that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Was there any time inthe interrogation that you would reveal anything about yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  Did you, did you ever interrogate anybody who was close to where you had come from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gunderstein</span> or —
ANSWER:  Yeah, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I once interrogated somebody who had been atthe <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  You're kidding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  And -- but that was about as close asI got to --

<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  They asked about my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  So they knew who you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  I explained to them who I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  Were your feelings any different to the 15 and 16 year old than to the higher ranking officers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They were all Germans to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  When did the conversation or the interrogation ever touch on what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  Most of these people didn't know very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">They knew they existed, but I did, after the war, spend ashort time at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> interrogating guards and people there, and it looked just like those pictures that you've seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Sois that what you were referring to earlier when you said you couldn't touch anybody, even if he had been a camp guard and you would have wanted to tear him apart?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  So this was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Do you remember what they were like, the kind of demeanor they had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  Very different, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Hundreds of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Some were arrogant Nazis; some were country boys who didn't know any political consequences; some were old-time Army guys who would follow orders no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So it was a great deal of difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Towards the end of war, asI said, they were 16, 17 year olds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Did this change you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  The war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  The experience of having been an interrogator.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  I think that the war probably changed me, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Maybe I grew up a lot quicker than I would have otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  What do you mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  That maybe I was more serious about the things I was doing than I would have been if I'd just been a21 ora 22 year old in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  What did they think of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  They were mostly worried about whether I was going to get hurt or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I think that was probably the most concern who had soldiers who were near the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And one of the problems was that there were no telephones and you had to write e- mail letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">| had one, which was special.</span></p>
